          "description": "Abilities unused will atrophy, so putting in anything less than your best means giving up on what you’re capable of. You can’t save talent or energy for better days, only watch it go to waste. This is a hard truth to accept if you don’t think your company has earned your best.\n\n\nAnd companies make employees feel like that all the time. This is part of what drives the whole “act your wage” rebellion. Why should you put in your best if work never seems to return the favor? It’s a perfectly human response of spite in the face of unfairness, but you can’t avenge your grievances by squandering your potential.\n\n\nThe years will wash away quickly. If you wait for the perfect company to reveal your peak potential, it may never come. Or by the time it does come, you’re not ready, because you’re no longer who you were. You let it slip. That’s a tragedy.\n\n\nWhatever the situation, whatever the company, you should show up with your very best. Not for them, but for you. Use the discontent to become better, then bolt to another camp when the opportunity presents itself.\n\n\nBesides, you’ll appreciate a good place so much more if you’ve made it through some bad places.\n\n\nDon’t play yourself by living down to their expectations. Show yourself the path out by shining bright whatever the weather.",

Usually by midnight, I'll have driven at least a good two hours of the required minimum six. But this edition of Le Mans also had more drama than any of the previous nine attempts I've been part of. At the end of the race, 22 cars had retired from crashes or mechanical issues, and several more were limping home many laps down.

This experiment convinced millions of employees of how much better life could be without a commute or even having to live by the office, but also left uneasy the legions of managers whose skills and mindsets were anchored in the office.\nThis reversal plot is know as hybrid work, and combines the worst of in-office and remote work worlds.

But the natural inclination is to promote senior contributors up a managerial ladder, and out of the trenches. This often ends poorly, turning the promotion into a punishment.\nIt's usually not that these potential managers don't like working with others. Quite the contrary. I've found that nothing motivates ambitious people like working close together with other talented individuals. It's also usually not that they're uncomfortable being senior, in terms of setting a direction for the work.

Dropping these 360s was perhaps one of the most popular acts of minimizing management we've ever done at 37signals.\nIt should have been obvious that the 360 process wasn't valuable because almost nobody wanted to do it.

The traditional paradigm of a reporting manager that's constantly following up with their reports, conducting daily stand-up meetings, weekly 1-1s, and all other forms of intensive supervision, needs to be (mostly) replaced with an asynchronous, self-managing paradigm instead.\nLet's look at five ways that principle works in practice at 37signals. \nFirst, we've replaced the commonly used daily stand-up meetings with a set of automated questions in Basecamp. On Monday mornings, we ask everyone \"What are you going to work on this week?\", and at the end of every day, we ask \"What did you work on today?\".

They protect their money with budgets, CFOs, and investments.\nThey guard so many things, but all too often they fail to protect what’s both most vulnerable and precious: their employees’ time and attention.\nCompanies spend their employees’ time and attention as if there was an infinite supply of both. As if they cost nothing. Yet employees’ time and attention are among the scarcest resources we have.\nAt 37signals, we see it as our top job to protect our employees’ time and attention. You can’t expect people to do great work if they don’t have a full day’s attention to devote to it. Partial attention is barely attention at all.\nFor examp…",

          "description": "Recently I found that xref in Emacs had stopped working for me on my mac laptop. Today I finally tried to figure out what went wrong. xref is just a front-end, all the work is done by backends. It took a while for me to realize (ie remember) that I was using the excellent dumb-jump package as the backend. dumb-jump uses a range of fast search commands (such as ag and ripgrep) to detect references without using the awkward tags tables that Emacs used to rely on.\nThe command flow between xref and dumb-jump is difficult to follow, but looking at the dumb-jump customization page alerted me to dumb-jump having a debug option. With this enabled, I could see what command dumb-jump was sending to the operating system. By default it uses git grep while in a git repo (almost everything I do is in a git repo). Its git grep command is quite complex, using regexps to (I assume) get more sensible results. I tried out the command it issued in my own terminal and it failed to find anything, while a simple git grep worked fine.\nArmed with a better knowledge of what was failing, I dug into dumb-jump’s issues and found Issue with git-grep. Reading that, I discovered that a change to git grep means that how git grep processes regexes differs depending on the operating system. This would mean that dumb-jump would need to detect git-grep’s version and the underlying OS to pick the right regexes for its search.\nThe fix for me is to force dumb-jump to use another searcher with (setq dumb-jump-force-searcher 'rg). With that my xref commands worked again.",

Plenty of evidence backing up any side you want to take here.\n\n\nWhat always surprises me is that most assume that existing companies have a choice. Generally speaking, I don't think they do.
