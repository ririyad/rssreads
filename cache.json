It breaks down the history of first how the Republican party got overrun by low-rung thinking from the mid-90s forward, then how equally low-rung thinking got the other side in the past decade or so. It's a light, humorous recap of modern American political history. I highly recommend it.\nIt's central contribution is adding a second dimension to the political spectrum. What we're dealing with is not just far-left, left, center, right, far-right. That spectrum is about contesting \"what is\" and \"what ought to be\".

Several of the giants are already on their second rounds, and few would probably bet against a third after those. But as hard as it is on an individual level – and it's always hard! – there's a silver lining for the economy as a whole: Releasing captive talent.\nSee, the big tech companies gobbled up so much talent at such high salaries during the pandemic that it scarcely left any for the rest of the economy. So many companies outside of big tech were priced out of the competition for key tech hires. That just can't be good for the economy in the long run. We need smart people focused on other problems beyond figuring out how to make people click more ads.\nBut while the mammoth cuts at Facebook, Amazon, and els…",

          "description": "The majority of customers will never tell you why they stop buying on their own. In fact, even if pressed, most will just smile, nod, and give you some face-saving reason for how “now is just not the right time” or “we are just going in a different direction”. Because that’s what avoids conflict.\n\n\nThus, the only time you’re truly allowed a free peek at the naked truth of why your product or service didn’t fit, is when the customer is really upset. That’s when they might air out their frustration.\n\n\nThis is a test. \n\n\nYou can either protect your ego from the sharp words of a frustrated customer by dismissing the feedback entirely OR you can be smart enough to filter out the emotion while retaining the crucial information that’ll improve your offering. Every loud, angry customer represents at least a dozen silent ones you lost to the same issues.\n\n\nBut it’s hard! We bond with our creations and our companies because that’s the human thing to do if you like your work. So those sharp words can and often do hurt your feelings. It’s only natural to want to parry and riposte.  \n\n\nBefore you do, though, remember the coin. If the customer takes the side that says “this is the end of the world”, you have to train yourself not to instinctively reach for “it’s no big deal / you’re overreacting / everyone else is fine with it”. If you do, you’ll gain nothing, and you’ll learn nothing.\n\n\nSo embrace the conflict of an angry customer as a rare gift of feedback. Remove your ego from the response. Extract the maximum amount of information to feed back into the offering.\n\n\nThat’s how you win. By building better rather than defending worse.",

          "description": "Recent discussions with my colleagues showed that many software teams\n     still run into trouble because they pack too much planned\n     work into their iterations. Teams will usually run better when they have\n     deliberate Slack, as it allows their delivery to be more predictable and\n     gives them time to improve their environment.\nWhile writing that bliki post, I also defined two styles of task\n     planning in agile projects. Timeboxed Iterations are used to\n     break up work into small chunks with a regular cadence to reassess the work\n     and future plans. Using a little ceremony around allocating work to\n     iterations helps make problems visible so that they can be dealt with\n     properly. Continuous Flow\n     dispenses with that ceremony, so skilled teams often prefer it.\nmore…",

He has been involved with registry design and authentication discussions, and has been closely working with the team over the past year.\nScott has been very active in the past year, working on various parts of Cargo, namely implementing workspace inheritance. Since then, he has been helping with maintenance and designing new features.\nWith their help we now have capacity to start thinking about how feature development should be done moving forward. We are still in early discussions of processes for matching feature development with reviewer capacity, and will share more in the future. Thanks to Arlo and Scott for their help, and we are very much looking forward to having them as a part of the team!",
