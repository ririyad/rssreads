You often see a version of this incredulity when the peanut gallery weighs in on the choices of billionaires. Why do these Very Rich People continue to do things – especially things I disagree with! – when they have enough money to live forever after on a beach sipping mojitos and taking pottery classes?! I WOULD NEVER.\nIt's a curious contradiction in the conceptualization of ambition. On the one hand, the \"I WOULD NEVER\" sentiment is drawn from a longing desire to have financial freedom. Fantasizing about what life would be like without a boss, without bills to worry about, and without the other obligations of modern life carried …",

          "description": "It's rarely the terrible decisions, processes, or even people that'll sink your organization. It's the accumulation and inertia of the mediocre ones. Dealing with the truly bad is easy. It's painfully obvious to all that change is required. The danger is imminent. It's much harder to find the will to act when the danger lurks in inadequate urgency, cumbersome collaboration, or just a missing spark. But act you must, before inertia sets in to devour you whole.\nThe insidious nature of inertia is in its ability to compound the cost of action as time goes on. Letting go of an employee that just didn't meet the bar after three months is endlessly easier than doing the same after three years. Same with reverting a bad organizational restructuring or poor development practices or awkward reporting protocols. Every additional month you let mediocrity fester, you make it harder to undo.\nBecause hitting undo usually means at least one difficult conversation, some amount of disappointment, and a recognition that you get this one wrong. All factors that most mortals are loathe to face! It's so much more comfortable to punt. Come up with excuses of why it just hasn't worked yet. Why just a bit more time is needed to turn it around. Any argument will do, as long as it postpones the requirement to move.\nAnd if mediocrity dwelled in isolation, you'd probably get away with it. That's exactly why it's so difficult to counter. It's rarely the one mediocre employee, process, or decision that conspires to take you off course. It's the accumulation of all of them together.\nThe sad truth is that most of us are cowards whenever we can be. We usually know what needs to be done, but we shrink from the responsibility to do it. Unless occasion calls upon us without a choice, we'll find a way around.\nWhenever I find myself looking at a coward in the mirror, I remind myself: Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life. Make the hard choices. Even when it's possible to punt. The inertia of mediocrity will not break unless you break it.",

          "description": "Google will eventually kill every single service you care about, if they can't find a way to directly monetize it with ads at a scale of billions. They're institutionally incapable of being in the product or service business, because neither products nor services butter Google's bread. Advertisement does.\nYou can see this emphasis in a myriad of ways, but my favorite lens is customer service. Google has always been uniquely awful when it comes to customer service, because helping someone with a problem on Workspaces or even the Google Cloud Platform was never going to be as profitable as helping an advertiser carpet bomb your attention span.\nThis is an evergreen observation, but I'm bringing it up in celebration of Google killing their domain name registrar Google Domains just now. After nine years in business, it'll unceremoniously get obliterated in just three months (and the shrapnel sold to Squarespace). That was a $180m/year business, servicing 10 million domains!\nIt's no better in the dead-business-walking department of Google Home / Nest. Google bought Nest almost a decade ago, and has managed to do worse than nothing with its product portfolio since. Just a few years ago they killed Nest Secure, leaving anyone who bought into that system with a bundle of bricks next year. And the Google Home app that was supposed to take over from the superior Nest app has been a multi-year stumble of embarrassment and neglect.\nWith a history like this, why would anyone trust Google on products and services outsides of the ad space? This goes from Workspaces to Gmail for Domains to even the Google Cloud Platform. This company is one major reorganization or recently promoted executive away from murdering any of these.\nAll I'm saying is you better have a backup plan. Be that for your collaboration, your email, your home security system. Anything that reads \"Made by Google\" implicitly has the subscript \"until we don't give a fuck any more\" printed below.",

And it's hard to protect your senses against this if you're constantly in close mental proximity to those who've had success running the established script. To escape back to first principles, you need to consciously turn down the volume on the world.\nI credit much of the novel work we've done on product development, organizational design, and software tooling at 37signals with being far removed from the centers of Silicon Valley. Physically, spiritually, and mentally. Right from the start.\nBeing in Chicago in those early years of the post-dot-com-bust internet was like living in a monastery. We knew there was a party going on a hundred miles inland, but the debauchery was never so close as to color our thinking or tempt our aspirations. We were geographically destined to see the world in a different light.\nThis was before social media. When much of Silicon Valley's propaganda had to be carried by monthly magazines and the occasionally breathless mainstream story. Which made it so much easier to tune out. Now it's more work.\nIt takes concerted effort these days to escape the AI FOMO fest, say. Like it required fortitude to resist the fear of missing out on the latest coin hype before that. Every feed is there to homogenize your thinking into a preconfigured camp. For or against, hype or denounce. These are all just plusses and minuses in front of the same thinking.\nIf you want more than this, you ought to embrace the paradox that there are times when the less you know raises the bar for what you can do.

You can’t save talent or energy for better days, only watch it go to waste. This is a hard truth to accept if you don’t think your company has earned your best.\n\n\nAnd companies make employees feel like that all the time.

But the natural inclination is to promote senior contributors up a managerial ladder, and out of the trenches. This often ends poorly, turning the promotion into a punishment.\nIt's usually not that these potential managers don't like working with others. Quite the contrary. I've found that nothing motivates ambitious people like working close together with other talented individuals. It's also usually not that they're uncomfortable being senior, in terms of setting a direction for the work. It's that they don't want the responsibility, and associated guilt, that comes with managing others. Especially when there's a need for correction.\nI've witnessed time and again how someone…",

Their efforts have been critical for the Rust Project. However, we do recognize that the governance of the Rust Project has had its shortcomings. We hope to build on the successes and improve upon the failures to ultimately lead to greater transparency and accountability.\nWe know that there is a lot of work to do and we are eager to get started. In the coming weeks we will be establishing the basic infrastructure for the group, including creating a plan for regular meetings and a process for raising agenda items, setting up a team repository, and ultimately completing the transition from the former Rust leadership structures.\nWe will post more once this bootstrapping process has been completed.\nThe RFC defines the launching pad team as a temporary umbrella team to represent subteams that do not currently have a top-level team. ↩",

          "description": "I've worked fully remotely for the last ten years. I find the discussion about remote work fascinating. Is remote better or a lesser evil? Is a decision full of tradeoffs? Something that works in some circumstances, but that is not a good default? \n\n\nAs with every complex subject, people – me included – love to reduce it to a dichotomy. A binary choice where you can either be right or wrong. I'm in the camp of remote-work-is-the-best, but I can't deny that many folks and companies thrive with on-site work. Plenty of evidence backing up any side you want to take here.\n\n\nWhat always surprises me is that most assume that existing companies have a choice. Generally speaking, I don't think they do. If a company obtaining good results isn't working remotely already, it will likely fail to switch…",

          "description": "Imagine a problem you can't understand without solving it first. The first time I saw software development described as a wicked problem was in Code Complete by Steve McConnell, and I haven't seen anything but a constant validation of this proposition throughout my career. And it's a paradoxical one with several counterintuitive corollaries. Here's one: if you don't understand what you need to build, you should start building it. And here's another: sweating to build something just to hit the delete button is sometimes part of the process.\n\n\nWriting and making code work is costly; thinking and discussing things in the abstract is cheap. Everything holds up on paper, but computers are picky. I don’t believe that LLMs – as revolutionary as they are – will change this imbalance soon. Spending…",

And he embodies the spirit of Stack Overflow:  Its transparency, playfulness, and even some of its struggles to be as welcoming and friendly as it should be. \n  \n But you'll see what I mean. \n  \n So stick around as Ben takes us on a journey through the building of Stack Overflow.
