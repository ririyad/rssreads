          "description": "One of the most important techniques I've embraced for managing my time is to direct related tasks to a bucket, let that bucket accumulate until full, then empty it all in one go. This in contrast to trying to catch every task the moment it lands from the myriad of interruption pipes that'll drip-drip-drip your day away if you let them. Nowhere is the most evident than with email.\nI used to take such pride in inbox zero when I was still using Gmail. I'd check email continuously throughout the day, and I'd get back to almost everyone immediately. Whether it was urgent or not. Just so I could see that sweet zero. It felt very productive. It was not.\nEvery email is a drop, and every drop ripples the surface of your mind. It's careless to let them hit without a filter. Your attention will have…",

Several of the giants are already on their second rounds, and few would probably bet against a third after those. But as hard as it is on an individual level – and it's always hard! – there's a silver lining for the economy as a whole: Releasing captive talent.\nSee, the big tech companies gobbled up so much talent at such high salaries during the pandemic that it scarcely left any for the rest of the economy. So many companies outside of big tech were priced out of the competition for key tech hires. That just can't be good for the economy in the long run. We need smart people focused on other problems beyond figuring out how to make people click more ads.\nBut while the mammoth cuts at Facebook, Amazon, and els…",

          "description": "The majority of customers will never tell you why they stop buying on their own. In fact, even if pressed, most will just smile, nod, and give you some face-saving reason for how “now is just not the right time” or “we are just going in a different direction”. Because that’s what avoids conflict.\n\n\nThus, the only time you’re truly allowed a free peek at the naked truth of why your product or service didn’t fit, is when the customer is really upset. That’s when they might air out their frustration.\n\n\nThis is a test. \n\n\nYou can either protect your ego from the sharp words of a frustrated customer by dismissing the feedback entirely OR you can be smart enough to filter out the emotion while retaining the crucial information that’ll improve your offering. Every loud, angry customer represents at least a dozen silent ones you lost to the same issues.\n\n\nBut it’s hard! We bond with our creations and our companies because that’s the human thing to do if you like your work. So those sharp words can and often do hurt your feelings. It’s only natural to want to parry and riposte.  \n\n\nBefore you do, though, remember the coin. If the customer takes the side that says “this is the end of the world”, you have to train yourself not to instinctively reach for “it’s no big deal / you’re overreacting / everyone else is fine with it”. If you do, you’ll gain nothing, and you’ll learn nothing.\n\n\nSo embrace the conflict of an angry customer as a rare gift of feedback. Remove your ego from the response. Extract the maximum amount of information to feed back into the offering.\n\n\nThat’s how you win. By building better rather than defending worse.",

Only actions can pry open a locked mind, and most minds remain locked most of the time. So if you wish to be persuasive, you ought to spend less time arguing and more time doing.\nThis is as it should be. Talk is cheap, and others are right to keep their considered positions from being for sale at a discount. Everyone should be open to change their mind, of course, but they should also keep the bar high or they'll drift about constantly and randomly.\nThere are a thousand plausible arguments available for every possible side of any issue, but rarely more than a few that can be substantiated by reality, once put to the test. This is why we listen more to those who do than those who merely opine. Both might be wrong, but odds favor the lessons derived from contact with the real world over those kept safe from falsification.\nCredibility is thus the consequence of successful actions. The social payoff for taking a risk and seeing it through. This again is as it should be. There's an endless supply of people willing to stake nothing on their convictions in the realm of arguments, but only a few ready to risk the effort of being wrong by actually following through.\nThis is what skin in the game is all about. Wrestling reality over the veracity of an idea, so that you may earn the keys required to unlock the minds of others, and advance us all.",

This led to a\nmiscompilation that the Rust\nteam is debugging, but in the meantime we're reverting the change to enable\nLTO.\nThis is currently believed to have no effect on wider usage of ThinLTO. The\nRust compiler used an unstable flag as part of the build process to enable\nThinLTO despite compiling to a dylib.\nThere are a few other regression fixes included in the release:\nFix building the compiler with --enable-local-rust\nTreat $prefix-clang as clang in linker detection code\nFix a panic in the compiler\nContributors to 1.68.1\nMany people came together to create Rust 1.68.1.

          "description": "I’m always amazed by the power of technology and the creativity of people who use it. Today I want to share with you a project that I did for fun and learning. It’s about how to use Tailscale Funnel to host a Headscale server from behind NAT. Sounds crazy, right? Let me explain.\nTailscale Funnel is a tool that lets you share a web service on your private network with the public internet. It’s like having your own personal cloud without the hassle of setting up servers and domains. Headscale is a tool that lets you create your own Tailscale control plane. It’s like having your own private VPN without relying on a third-party service.\nNow, what if you could combine these two tools and create a network that uses Tailscale without using Tailscale? That’s exactly what I did. I used waifud, NixOS, and Funnel to create a virtual machine that runs Headscale and exposes it to the internet. Then I used Funnel to connect other devices to this network and enjoy the benefits of Tailscale.\nWhy did I do this? Because I love learning new things and challenging myself. Because I believe in the power of open source and decentralized solutions. Because I wanted to have some fun and make some jokes along the way.\nThis project taught me a lot about networking, security, and automation. It also showed me how much potential there is in tools like Tailscale and Headscale. And it made me laugh at the absurdity of using Tailscale without using Tailscale.\nIf you’re curious about how I did this, you can check out my blog post where I explain everything in detail. It’s not a serious tutorial, but rather a playful experiment.\nI hope this post inspires you to try new things and have fun with technology. Remember, nothing is impossible if you put your mind to it. And don’t forget to laugh at yourself sometimes.",

But sometimes, you need to let the outside world access your web server, whether it’s for testing, hosting, or collaborating.\nThat’s why I’m super excited about Tailscale Funnel, a new feature that lets you route traffic from the internet to your Tailscale node. You can think of it as publicly sharing a node for anyone to access, even if they don’t have Tailscale themselves.\nTailscale Funnel is easy to set up and use. You just need to enable it in the admin console and on your node, and you’ll get a public DNS name for your node that points to Tailscale’s Funnel servers. These servers will proxy the incoming requests over Tailscale to your node, where you can terminate the TLS and serve your content.\nThe best part is that Tailscale Funnel is secure and private. The Funnel servers don’t see any information about your traffic or what you’re serving. They only see the source IP and port, the SNI name, and the number of bytes passing through. And they can’t connect to your nodes directly. They only offer a TCP connection, which your nodes can accept or reject.\nTailscale Funnel is currently in beta and available for all users. I’ve been using it for a while now and I’m blown away by how simple and powerful it is. It’s like having your own personal cloud service without any hassle or cost.",

          "description": "Hello! A few years I wrote a post called A new way I’m getting feedback on my posts: beta readers!\nabout how I’d started using beta readers.\nThe basic strategy for getting feedback there was to email people a PDF and ask\nfor feedback. This was kind of inefficient, and so over the past couple of\nyears, I’ve worked a lot with Marie Flanagan to\nimprove the process. In this post we’ll talk about:\nthe custom site we built to handle all of the feedback\nhow (and why) we designed that site\nthe specific categories of feedback we ask for (and why we chose those categories)\nThe site isn’t open source, this post is just about the process of building and\nusing it. There are some screenshots further down.\nFirst, let’s talk about some problems with the original process.\nproblem 1: managing the feedback w…",

Why not\nsome other size?\nWith any question like this, I think there are two options:\nIt’s a historical accident, another size (like 4 or 6 or 16 bits) would work just as well\n8 bits is objectively the Best Option for some reason, even if history had played out differently we would still use 8-bit bytes\nsome mix of 1 & 2\nI’m not super into computer history (I like to use computers a lot more than I\nlike reading about them), but I am always curious if there’s an essential\nreason for why a computer thing is the way it is today, or whether it’s mostly\na historical accident.
