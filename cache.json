Oh, and we were a lap down on the leaders in our class. Doh!\nI've never had the race go that long before getting into the car. Usually by midnight, I'll have driven at least a good two hours of the required minimum six. But this edition of Le Mans also had more drama than any of the previous nine attempts I've been part of. At the end of the race, 22 cars had retired from crashes or mechanical issues, and several more were limping home many laps down. It was mayhem.\nWhich started right from the words green, green, green. By the first chicane down the Mulsanne straight, a Cadillac in the class above us crashed hard immediately in front of …",

This experiment convinced millions of employees of how much better life could be without a commute or even having to live by the office, but also left uneasy the legions of managers whose skills and mindsets were anchored in the office.\nThis reversal plot is know as hybrid work, and combines the worst of in-office and remote work worlds. The shrewd – but likely temporary – concession here is starting with three days in the office, two from home.

But the natural inclination is to promote senior contributors up a managerial ladder, and out of the trenches. This often ends poorly, turning the promotion into a punishment.\nIt's usually not that these potential managers don't like working with others. Quite the contrary. I've found that nothing motivates ambitious people like working close together with other talented individuals. It's also usually not that they're uncomfortable being senior, in terms of setting a direction for the work. It's that they don't want the responsibility, and associated guilt, that comes with managing others. Especially when there's a need for correction.\nI've witnessed time and again how someone…",

The rest of the time, across hundreds of reviews, it was an arduous, awkward affair of forcing people to come up with novel ways to congratulate each other on command. Dropping these 360s was perhaps one of the most popular acts of minimizing management we've ever done at 37signals.\nIt should have been obvious that the 360 process wasn't valuable because almost nobody wanted to do it.

There's just a special kind of magic that comes from being together, which Zoom will never match or catch. But what's enabled the remote-work revolution to be effective is that these moments don't need to happen every day, week, or even month. \nAt 37signals, we've been doing company-wide meetups twice a year for over fifteen years. Through these meetups, we've secured the lion's share of the social in-person benefits afforded by an office, while allowing nearly eighty people from twenty countries to collaborate happily and effectively.

The traditional paradigm of a reporting manager that's constantly following up with their reports, conducting daily stand-up meetings, weekly 1-1s, and all other forms of intensive supervision, needs to be (mostly) replaced with an asynchronous, self-managing paradigm instead.\nLet's look at five ways that principle works in practice at 37signals. \nFirst, we've replaced the commonly used daily stand-up meetings with a set of automated questions in Basecamp. On Monday mornings, we ask everyone \"What are you going to work on this week?\", and at the end of every day, we ask \"What did you work on today?\".

Customer life-time value, cost of acquisition, cohort retention, revenue churn, net promoter score, funnel conversion rates, to name but a few. All useful calculations, but I can't tell you what bliss it's been to steer 37signals without them for twenty years.\nThat's not to say that we never run these numbers, but it is to say that these numbers never run us.

Building and growing requires consumption, addition, parlaying some of this into a lot of that.\nBut the smartest businesses — the ones that tend to stick around for the long haul — know that existence is also about avoidance.\nAvoiding careening variable costs, avoiding getting involved with things that aren't core to your business, avoiding spending time on things that don't matter, avoiding bad investments, avoiding people who don't help you prosper, and even avoiding customers who aren't the right fit.\nHowever, there's something even more fundamental to avoid.

          "description": "Recently I found that xref in Emacs had stopped working for me on my mac laptop. Today I finally tried to figure out what went wrong. xref is just a front-end, all the work is done by backends. It took a while for me to realize (ie remember) that I was using the excellent dumb-jump package as the backend. dumb-jump uses a range of fast search commands (such as ag and ripgrep) to detect references without using the awkward tags tables that Emacs used to rely on.\nThe command flow between xref and dumb-jump is difficult to follow, but looking at the dumb-jump customization page alerted me to dumb-jump having a debug option. With this enabled, I could see what command dumb-jump was sending to the operating system. By default it uses git grep while in a git repo (almost everything I do is in a git repo). Its git grep command is quite complex, using regexps to (I assume) get more sensible results. I tried out the command it issued in my own terminal and it failed to find anything, while a simple git grep worked fine.\nArmed with a better knowledge of what was failing, I dug into dumb-jump’s issues and found Issue with git-grep. Reading that, I discovered that a change to git grep means that how git grep processes regexes differs depending on the operating system. This would mean that dumb-jump would need to detect git-grep’s version and the underlying OS to pick the right regexes for its search.\nThe fix for me is to force dumb-jump to use another searcher with (setq dumb-jump-force-searcher 'rg). With that my xref commands worked again.",

          "description": "As part of bringing myself up-to-speed after joining TigerBeetle, I\nwanted some background on how distributed consensus and replicated state\nmachines protocols work. TigerBeetle uses Viewstamped\nReplication. But I\nwanted to understand all popular protocols and I decided to start with\nRaft.\nWe'll implement two key components of Raft in this post (leader\nelection and log replication). Around 1k lines of Go. It took me\naround 7 months of sporadic studying to come to (what I hope is) an\nunderstanding of the basics.\nDisclaimer: I'm not an expert. My implementation isn't yet hooked\nup to Jepsen. I've run it\nthrough a mix of\nmanual and\nautomated\ntests and\nit seems generally correct. This is not intended to be used in\nproduction. It's just for my education.\nAll code for this project is available o…",

My criteria is that:\nThe subreddit topic is relevant to advancing as a programmer\nPosts generally go into good depth\nThe comments stay on topic\nAnd the shit-posting is minimal\nThis list isn't hard to guess at if you consider advanced topics\nin software. But I wanted to share because I think it's worth\nexplicitly supporting high-quality subreddits.\n/r/EmuDev\nMy favorite sub of all. Also has a phenomenal Discord group.\n/r/ProgrammingLanguages\nFocuses a little more on PLT topics (parsing techniques, syntax, type systems) than on compiling and interpreting techniques, but still good.\n/r/DatabaseDevelopment\nAll about database internals, which ends up involving a bunch of\ncorrectness and distributed systems stuff as well.\nDisclosure: I run this sub. It's at 2.7k+ members at time of publishing.\n/r/ReverseEngineering\nThe largest subreddit on this list but still has pretty good posts.\n/r/EsoLangs\nOne of the best/most fun intros to programming languages/compilers/interpreters is through languages like Brainfuck. This sub does a good job of keeping the fun going.\n/r/Compilers\n/r/GraphicsProgramming\nWhile some language subreddits are pretty good, they are more so a\nmixed bag than some of the topic-specific subreddits here. So they\ndon't make my list, more on principle than anything else.\nIf there is a good one already, send me it!\nWhat am I missing?\nAm I missing other amazing subreddits? Just don't say\nlanguage-specific ones. :)\n\nIt's an incorrect meme IMO that tech Reddit is low-quality. You just have to find the interesting subreddits.\nI've updated my list for 2023.https://t.co/OtM2tk8HOn pic.twitter.com/ymyzChp0SO\n— Phil Eaton (@eatonphil) May 16, 2023",

I think that's a good thing actually.\n\nThese are the books I recommend to developers wanting to improve their\nskills as professional programmers because of high information\ndensity, believable premises/examples, and being well edited.\nYou don't need to read books to improve as a developer but\nthey are unparalleled in quickly helping you gain depth in a subject.\nHigh Performance Browser Networking\nIf you deal with networks, you would probably benefit from this book.\nIt is a thorough high level introduction to mobile networks, browser\nnetwork protocols, and fundementals of networking.\nDesigning Data-Intensive Applications\nIf you use a database (including an in-memory array of items you\nsearch periodically) or if you build APIs, you would probably benefit\nfrom this book. A solid introduction to distributed computing, data\ntransfer, indexing, etc.\nThat's it!\nGeneric software books conspicuously not on this list for\nme:\nClean Code\nJavaScript the Good Parts\nDesign Patterns/Gang of Four\nStructure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\nA Philosophy of Software Design\nThey're not all bad but give nowhere near as much return for the\ninvestment of your time.\n\nFour books I recommend to professional developers wanting to improve their craft, and a few I'd nothttps://t.co/1aTrfqZ9bd\n— Phil Eaton (@phil_eaton) February 2, 2021",
