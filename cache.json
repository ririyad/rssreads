          "description": "Our 2023 marketing campaign for Basecamp kicked off on a ton of different channels at once. Web ads, search ads, podcast ads, and TV ads all blasted the message of JUST LET ME DO MY JOB. Our flagship commercial was a hit with the audience and the critics. But our attempt at out-of-home advertising, with billboards all over Boston, was a bust at a $300,000 cost.\n\n\n    \n      \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\n  \n\nThat's advertisement! It's hard to know what's going to work unless you give it a go. And since we're fighting competitors with one hand behind our back by refusing to use privacy-invasive ads targeted on personal data, we thought it was worth trying some more conventional channels, like billboards. But at least for software like Basecamp, it's clear that isn't likely to work.\nIt's not that it did nothing. We did have 98 billboards all over Boston for about a month. But the effect was only barely measurable:\n  \n      \n        \n\n  \nAs you can see, we were at the top end of the predicted normal range, or even slightly above. But even with that, we ended up spending thousands of dollars on every attributable trial signup. Way outside the realm of anything we could claim a return on, even if you factored in a fair bit of long-run brand awareness.\nI will say that it felt pretty cool to see the irreverent Basecamp marketing messages appear on building-hugging billboards. There was an emotionally gratifying return on the investment. And perhaps that explains why it used to be common to see business software advertised in places like San Francisco where a lot of executives of such companies could feel good about seeing them. There's something gratifying about being in the real world like this.\nBut yeah, it didn't work. We won't be doing that again. But we'll always have the pictures 😄",

Several of the giants are already on their second rounds, and few would probably bet against a third after those.

So many companies outside of big tech were priced out of the competition for key tech hires. That just can't be good for the economy in the long run.

          "description": "The majority of customers will never tell you why they stop buying on their own. In fact, even if pressed, most will just smile, nod, and give you some face-saving reason for how “now is just not the right time” or “we are just going in a different direction”. Because that’s what avoids conflict.\n\n\nThus, the only time you’re truly allowed a free peek at the naked truth of why your product or service didn’t fit, is when the customer is really upset. That’s when they might air out their frustration.\n\n\nThis is a test. \n\n\nYou can either protect your ego from the sharp words of a frustrated customer by dismissing the feedback entirely OR you can be smart enough to filter out the emotion while retaining the crucial information that’ll improve your offering. Every loud, angry customer represents at least a dozen silent ones you lost to the same issues.\n\n\nBut it’s hard! We bond with our creations and our companies because that’s the human thing to do if you like your work. So those sharp words can and often do hurt your feelings. It’s only natural to want to parry and riposte.  \n\n\nBefore you do, though, remember the coin. If the customer takes the side that says “this is the end of the world”, you have to train yourself not to instinctively reach for “it’s no big deal / you’re overreacting / everyone else is fine with it”. If you do, you’ll gain nothing, and you’ll learn nothing.\n\n\nSo embrace the conflict of an angry customer as a rare gift of feedback. Remove your ego from the response. Extract the maximum amount of information to feed back into the offering.\n\n\nThat’s how you win. By building better rather than defending worse.",

And I'm trying to move this way, of working with my own team. I just wonder if you guys have any tips or help for making that transition, helping team members take ownership for their areas of work, maybe obstacles I can watch out for leading my team in this way as we move in this direction. We have a small team, just a handful of people. But I would love to move in this direction where they're taking more ownership and I can delegate whole projects rather than, um, me kind of owning the project and then delegating tasks...\n\nWe're likely going to address this question out loud on an upcoming podcast AMA, but I wa…",

Since then, he has been helping with maintenance and designing new features.\nWith their help we now have capacity to start thinking about how feature development should be done moving forward. We are still in early discussions of processes for matching feature development with reviewer capacity, and will share more in the future.
