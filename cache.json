Sure, we try our best to make good, educated guesses during the hiring process, and this is why asking finalists to do sample work projects is so crucial. But it still remains just guessing, and the truth doesn't emerge until you afford the hire a full attempt on a real project.\nThat's why I'm such a fan of starting new employees in the deep end. Putting them to work on a real project right away. But this is only half the commitment you ought to make to their potential.\nIt's just as important to retain the possibility of rapid progression by continuing to test their promise against harder and bigger challenges.

These little mental barnacles add up in imperceptible ways until you suddenly feel like you're getting nowhere, no matter how hard you push. You must keep scrubbing your mind clear of such attention-sapping colonies to remain capable of making smooth, swift progress.\nThese barnacles can accumulate from middling marketing initiatives, process theatre, and tolerance for mediocre performance. All individually presenting as more hassle to deal with than to dismiss, but combined killing the efficiency and focus on progress.\nBut they can also be things that actually appears to be working well enough, just not up to the bar of your very best. Those are the tricky ones. The base hits, the modest accomplishments, the things you might even have celebrated once. The past darlings.\nIt just doesn't matter. You can't keep stuffing your head with ever more things to pay partial attention to every month and expect to keep a clear eye on the horizon and the future. There's only room for so much.\nThe hardest part about this is not to wait until it's too much, until the drag is actually there. Keep your mind below carrying capacity, such that there's room for serendipity, at all times.\nIn short, be decisive about what you'll no longer do. Summon your inner Jack Welch to cut at least the bottom 10% of the stuff dragging your attention every few months or so.",

          "description": "Getting anything new off the ground usually requires a tremendous amount of urgency. It's hard to launch somethingÂ  from nothing into reality without being incredibly impatient for progress. Thus most founders begin ðŸŽ¶Their JourneyðŸŽ¶ sprinting from one pressing problem to the next in rapid succession to achieve their lift off. But reaching escape velocity doesn't guarantee you'll keep going, unless you retain the propulsion from an unreasonable sense of urgency.\nYet the irony of being successful in business is that it'll invariably attract smart people who can tell you all the good reasons for why you can no longer go as quickly as you once did. Why it's actually natural, perhaps even good, that a company ten or a hundred times the size of what it was when it first became successful now has to travel at half the pace to be prudent.\nDon't listen too closely. Not because they'll be wrong in any narrow technical sense, but because they're wrong in the broad directional sense. The risk of succumbing to the rigor mortis of success is usually far greater than the risk of making a mistake by not considering and mitigating all possible bad outcomes up front.\nIt's the risk of mandating everyone put on a bike helmet, only to realize that doing so means fewer people will bike, leading to worse health outcomes for all. Being obsessive about specific, short-term risks often sits in opposition to worrying about fuzzy, long-term risks.\nAnd nobody will be as motivated as a founder to inject risk into the business. Sticking with an unreasonable sense of urgency undoubtedly comes with clear and immediate risks. But giving up on it with even worse, less defined ones.\nSo don't give up. Every company needs to have someone asking why we can't launch next Monday instead of next month. Willing to accept and underwrite the risks needed to make it happen. And with a stomach for occasionally being wrong, eating the loss, but keep playing.",

But more productive at what?\nProductivity is for machines, not for people. Thereâ€™s nothing meaningful about packing some number of work units into some amount of time or squeezing more into less.\nMachines can work 24/7; humans canâ€™t.\nWhen people focus on productivity, they end up focusing on being busy. Filling every moment with something to do. And thereâ€™s always more to do!\nWe donâ€™t believe in busyness at Basecamp. We believe in effectiveness. How little can we do? How much can we cut out? Instead of adding to-dos, we add to-donâ€™ts.\nBeing productive is about occupying your timeâ€”filling your schedule to the brim and getting as much as you can. Being effective is about finding more of your time unoccupied and open for other things besides work. Time for leisure, time for family and friends. Or time for doing absolutely nothing.\nYes, itâ€™s perfectly okay to have nothing to do. Or, better yet, nothing worth doing. If youâ€™ve only got three hours of work to do on a given day, then stop. Donâ€™t fill your day with five more just to stay busy or feel productive.

They'd be right in calling the cops and getting a restraining order.\nI know this isn't how sales always works, but it's prevalent enough. I've been on the receiving end before.
