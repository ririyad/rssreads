          "description": "The recent and rapid advance of AI has rightfully giving many in software real doubts about the future of their profession. I'd probably still wager that the fears are overstated – that we also got prematurely euphoric about the imminent prospects of self-driving cars – and that AI generating code is different from it evolving existing systems. But I wouldn't want to bet the house on it. This might just be The Big One.\nThat uncertainty, whether we truly are on the cusp of a total transformation, is a surprising novelty to me, despite thirty years in software. We've been through so many breathless predictions about how this or that advancement in software would simply \"Change. Everything. Forever.\" that a certain pessimism would be perfectly reasonable.\nI've seen, for example, at least thre…",

          "description": "Our 2023 marketing campaign for Basecamp kicked off on a ton of different channels at once. Web ads, search ads, podcast ads, and TV ads all blasted the message of JUST LET ME DO MY JOB. Our flagship commercial was a hit with the audience and the critics. But our attempt at out-of-home advertising, with billboards all over Boston, was a bust at a $300,000 cost.\n\n\n    \n      \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\n  \n\nThat's advertisement! It's hard to know what's going to work unless you give it a go. And since we're fighting competitors with one hand behind our back by refusing to use privacy-invasive ads targeted on personal data, we thought it was worth trying some more conventional channels, like billboards. But at least for software like Basecamp, it's clear that isn't likely to work.\nIt's not that it did nothing. We did have 98 billboards all over Boston for about a month. But the effect was only barely measurable:\n  \n      \n        \n\n  \nAs you can see, we were at the top end of the predicted normal range, or even slightly above. But even with that, we ended up spending thousands of dollars on every attributable trial signup. Way outside the realm of anything we could claim a return on, even if you factored in a fair bit of long-run brand awareness.\nI will say that it felt pretty cool to see the irreverent Basecamp marketing messages appear on building-hugging billboards. There was an emotionally gratifying return on the investment. And perhaps that explains why it used to be common to see business software advertised in places like San Francisco where a lot of executives of such companies could feel good about seeing them. There's something gratifying about being in the real world like this.\nBut yeah, it didn't work. We won't be doing that again. But we'll always have the pictures 😄",

It's a light, humorous recap of modern American political history. I highly recommend it.\nIt's central contribution is adding a second dimension to the political spectrum.

          "description": "The majority of customers will never tell you why they stop buying on their own. In fact, even if pressed, most will just smile, nod, and give you some face-saving reason for how “now is just not the right time” or “we are just going in a different direction”. Because that’s what avoids conflict.\n\n\nThus, the only time you’re truly allowed a free peek at the naked truth of why your product or service didn’t fit, is when the customer is really upset. That’s when they might air out their frustration.\n\n\nThis is a test. \n\n\nYou can either protect your ego from the sharp words of a frustrated customer by dismissing the feedback entirely OR you can be smart enough to filter out the emotion while retaining the crucial information that’ll improve your offering. Every loud, angry customer represents at least a dozen silent ones you lost to the same issues.\n\n\nBut it’s hard! We bond with our creations and our companies because that’s the human thing to do if you like your work. So those sharp words can and often do hurt your feelings. It’s only natural to want to parry and riposte.  \n\n\nBefore you do, though, remember the coin. If the customer takes the side that says “this is the end of the world”, you have to train yourself not to instinctively reach for “it’s no big deal / you’re overreacting / everyone else is fine with it”. If you do, you’ll gain nothing, and you’ll learn nothing.\n\n\nSo embrace the conflict of an angry customer as a rare gift of feedback. Remove your ego from the response. Extract the maximum amount of information to feed back into the offering.\n\n\nThat’s how you win. By building better rather than defending worse.",

          "description": "Yesterday I was speaking to a university class and, as it usually does, a question about innovation came up.\n\n\n\"How do you stay innovative? How do you encourage innovative thinking at work?\"\n\n\nMy answer: You don't stay innovative and you don't encourage innovative thinking at work.\n\n\nWHAT? Yes.\n\n\nInnovation should almost never happen. It's incredibly rare. It mostly happens by accident, not by intention. It's wonderful when it does, but you merely fluctuate in and out of it, it's not steady state.\n\n\nWork is mostly mundane. It's mostly maintenance. It's mostly local improvement and iteration. Work is mostly... Work. Any innovation is an outlier, nearly a rounding error.\n\n\nEven the most innovative projects or products are full of rote, prosaic stuff that still needs building. The poetic magic may be in the 5%, but the bulk of the work is in the other 95.\n\n\nSo I told the students they'd better get used to that. Work is not often very exciting, but it can absolutely be fulfilling. And you can be excited about that. But if you're expecting breakthroughs all the time, riff sessions that constantly lead somewhere new, or brainstorms that shoot lightning, you're going to be disappointed.\n\n\nYes innovation happens. Occasionally. Being happy at work is about finding challenge, reward, growth, and creative and intellectual stimulation in everything else.\n\n\nNow... back to this new product we're building.\n\n\n-Jason",

But some of the most rewarding moments consistently come from making something simply useful.\nYesterday we shipped a feature in HEY called \"Reply to Everyone\" that was exactly that: Simply useful.\nOne of the things that makes something simply useful is a clear line from problem to solution. From hassle to effortlessness. From a lot of time to nearly no time at all. From creating work to eliminating work.\nSo let's trace Reply to Everyone back to the initial germ of the idea.\nIt all started with frustration. This is a great place to start any feature. In fact, the closer you start to frustration, the more fuel you have to burn up the problem.\nWha…",

It could be a call with a client. If could be a meeting with another department. It could be a conversation with a vendor. What if they bring this up...? What if they bring that up...?

If they're lucky, no one interrupts them while they're presenting. When it's over, people react. This is precisely the problem.\nThe person making the pitch has presumably put a lot of time, thought, and energy into gathering their thoughts and presenting them clearly to an audience. But the rest of the people in the room are asked to react. Not absorb, not think it over, not consider — just react. Knee-jerk it. That's no way to treat fragile, new ideas.\nAt 37signals we flip the script.\nWhen we present work, it's almost always written up first. In long form. A few hundred words, maybe a thousand.
