From deaths of despair, soaring crime in some cities, ballooning debts, dysfunctional politics, and a raging culture war. It's easy to be down on those United States. Too easy, in fact.\nTake gun deaths, for example. Americans own more guns per capita than any other country in the world, and by a huge margin too. Those guns are used by people to kill others and themselves. But while the homicide rate is up recently, it's still below where it was in the 90s or even the 70s. Suicides by gun haven't really swung that much either.\n  \n      \n        \n\n  \nIs this a great place to be? No. Is it some historical new peak? No. Have past peaks come down? Yes.

          "description": "Our 2023 marketing campaign for Basecamp kicked off on a ton of different channels at once. Web ads, search ads, podcast ads, and TV ads all blasted the message of JUST LET ME DO MY JOB. Our flagship commercial was a hit with the audience and the critics. But our attempt at out-of-home advertising, with billboards all over Boston, was a bust at a $300,000 cost.\n\n\n    \n      \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\n  \n\nThat's advertisement! It's hard to know what's going to work unless you give it a go. And since we're fighting competitors with one hand behind our back by refusing to use privacy-invasive ads targeted on personal data, we thought it was worth trying some more conventional channels, like billboards. But at least for software like Basecamp, it's clear that isn't likely to work.\nIt's not that it did nothing. We did have 98 billboards all over Boston for about a month. But the effect was only barely measurable:\n  \n      \n        \n\n  \nAs you can see, we were at the top end of the predicted normal range, or even slightly above. But even with that, we ended up spending thousands of dollars on every attributable trial signup. Way outside the realm of anything we could claim a return on, even if you factored in a fair bit of long-run brand awareness.\nI will say that it felt pretty cool to see the irreverent Basecamp marketing messages appear on building-hugging billboards. There was an emotionally gratifying return on the investment. And perhaps that explains why it used to be common to see business software advertised in places like San Francisco where a lot of executives of such companies could feel good about seeing them. There's something gratifying about being in the real world like this.\nBut yeah, it didn't work. We won't be doing that again. But we'll always have the pictures ðŸ˜„",

You can't hold both full-time jobs.\nAnd unless your company is probably 100+, CEO isn't really a job anyway. It's more of a role someone needs to play occasionally.\nThere simply aren't that many big picture things or decisions to \"execute\" day in and day out â€” or even week in and week out â€” to make it a true full time job. A role yes, a hat to wear yes, a full-time job at a smallish company? No. It's part-time at best, quarter-time even better.\nFurther, the fundamental responsibilities of Founders and CEOs are at odds.

How do you encourage innovative thinking at work?\"\n\n\nMy answer: You don't stay innovative and you don't encourage innovative thinking at work.\n\n\nWHAT? Yes.\n\n\nInnovation should almost never happen. It's incredibly rare. It mostly happens by accident, not by intention. It's wonderful when it does, but you merely fluctuate in and out of it, it's not steady state.\n\n\nWork is mostly mundane. It's mostly maintenance. It's mostly local improvement and iteration. Work is mostly... Work. Any innovation is an outlier, nearly a rounding error.\n\n\nEven the most innovative projects or products are full of rote, prosaic stuff that still needs building. The poetic magic may be in the 5%, but the bulk of the work is in the other 95.\n\n\nSo I told the students they'd better get used to that. Work is not often very exciting, but it can absolutely be fulfilling. And you can be excited about that. But if you're expecting breakthroughs all the time, riff sessions that constantly lead somewhere new, or brainstorms that shoot lightning, you're going to be disappointed.\n\n\nYes innovation happens. Occasionally. Being happy at work is about finding challenge, reward, growth, and creative and intellectual stimulation in everything else.\n\n\nNow... back to this new product we're building.\n\n\n-Jason",

Teams will usually run better when they have\n     deliberate Slack, as it allows their delivery to be more predictable and\n     gives them time to improve their environment.\nWhile writing that bliki post, I also defined two styles of task\n     planning in agile projects. Timeboxed Iterations are used to\n     break up work into small chunks with a regular cadence to reassess the work\n     and future plans. Using a little ceremony around allocating work to\n     iterations helps make problems visible so that they can be dealt with\n     properly. Continuous Flow\n     dispenses with that ceremony, so skilled teams often prefer it.\nmoreâ€¦",

Since then, he has been helping with maintenance and designing new features.\nWith their help we now have capacity to start thinking about how feature development should be done moving forward. We are still in early discussions of processes for matching feature development with reviewer capacity, and will share more in the future.

Everyone experiences joy and sadness as part of their daily lives: keeping a certain energy level is more feasible than a certain level of happiness.\n\n\nOn the other hand, as with anything related to habits, it's way easier to preach than practice. Many years ago, someone I love dearly told me that he tried to do more of what he liked and less of what he didn't. I remember thinking, \"Doh, what a naive approach to life\". Now I think there is deep wisdom there. Your internal energy is the result of a balance. You can have more money by either making more or spending less; you need to pay attention to both.\n\n\nIn my case, I know pretty well whâ€¦",
