So of course the recent ruling from the Supreme Court making its use in college admissions illegal was going to light a political fire. The surprising thing is just how contained the burn has been within the tech industry.
But perhaps it shouldn't be so surprising. As I argued last year, we're now in the waning days of DEI's dominance within the corporate world in general and tech in particular. I don't know exactly when future historians will pin the peak, but it'll be sometime in that 2020-2021 period. The only thing that's clear today is that things have calmed down considerably since the ideological crusade reigned supreme.

Adobe didn't pay $20 billion for nothing. But we don't do the bulk of our design work with or in Figma when developing Basecamp or HEY for the web. That's all done directly in HTML and CSS, as it should be.
Because no matter how good Figma is, it's an intermediary abstraction, like Photoshop before it. If you're working with the web, you'll work faster without such an abstraction layer in the design process filtering the collaboration between programmer and designer.

It's a curious contradiction in the conceptualization of ambition. On the one hand, the "I WOULD NEVER" sentiment is drawn from a longing desire to have financial freedom.

Ironically, this was a lesson I had to learn late in life myself. I used to find it silly when people would read the same book twice. With so much more knowledge to discover, why waste your efforts on what you've already explored?

And that's a lot. This is a wonderful country and a wonderful capital.
In fact, if you were to make a pro/con list contrasting family life in Denmark vs America, I think even fairly conservative parents from the US would find it difficult to compose a slam-dunk case for God's own country.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's rarely the terrible decisions, processes, or even people that'll sink your organization. It's the accumulation and inertia of the mediocre ones. Dealing with the truly bad is easy. It's painfully obvious to all that change is required. The danger is imminent. It's much harder to find the will to act when the danger lurks in inadequate urgency, cumbersome collaboration, or just a missing spark. But act you must, before inertia sets in to devour you whole.
The insidious nature of inertia is in its ability to compound the cost of action as time goes on. Letting go of an employee that just didn't meet the bar after three months is endlessly easier than doing the same after three years. Same with reverting a bad organizational restructuring or poor development practices or awkward reporting protocols. Every additional month you let mediocrity fester, you make it harder to undo.
Because hitting undo usually means at least one difficult conversation, some amount of disappointment, and a recognition that you get this one wrong. All factors that most mortals are loathe to face! It's so much more comfortable to punt. Come up with excuses of why it just hasn't worked yet. Why just a bit more time is needed to turn it around. Any argument will do, as long as it postpones the requirement to move.
And if mediocrity dwelled in isolation, you'd probably get away with it. That's exactly why it's so difficult to counter. It's rarely the one mediocre employee, process, or decision that conspires to take you off course. It's the accumulation of all of them together.
The sad truth is that most of us are cowards whenever we can be. We usually know what needs to be done, but we shrink from the responsibility to do it. Unless occasion calls upon us without a choice, we'll find a way around.
Whenever I find myself looking at a coward in the mirror, I remind myself: Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life. Make the hard choices. Even when it's possible to punt. The inertia of mediocrity will not break unless you break it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As of today, RFC 3392 has been merged, forming the new top level governance body of the Rust Project: the Leadership Council. The creation of this Council marks the end of both the Core Team and the interim Leadership Chat.
The Council will assume responsibility for top-level governance concerns while most of the responsibilities of the Rust Project (such as maintenance of the compiler and core tooling, evolution of the language and standard libraries, administration of infrastructure, etc.) remain with the nine top level teams.
Each of these top level teams, as defined in the RFC, has chosen a representative who collectively form the Council:
Compiler: Eric Holk
Crates.io: Carol (Nichols || Goulding)
Dev Tools: Eric Huss
Infrastructure: Ryan Levick
Language: Jack Huey
Launching Pad1: Jonathan Pallant
Library: Mara Bos
Moderation: Khionu Sybiern
Release: Mark Rousskov
First, we want to take a moment to thank the Core Team and interim Leadership Chat for the hard work they've put in over the years. Their efforts have been critical for the Rust Project. However, we do recognize that the governance of the Rust Project has had its shortcomings. We hope to build on the successes and improve upon the failures to ultimately lead to greater transparency and accountability.
We know that there is a lot of work to do and we are eager to get started. In the coming weeks we will be establishing the basic infrastructure for the group, including creating a plan for regular meetings and a process for raising agenda items, setting up a team repository, and ultimately completing the transition from the former Rust leadership structures.
We will post more once this bootstrapping process has been completed.
The RFC defines the launching pad team as a temporary umbrella team to represent subteams that do not currently have a top-level team. ↩]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google will eventually kill every single service you care about, if they can't find a way to directly monetize it with ads at a scale of billions. They're institutionally incapable of being in the product or service business, because neither products nor services butter Google's bread. Advertisement does.
You can see this emphasis in a myriad of ways, but my favorite lens is customer service. Google has always been uniquely awful when it comes to customer service, because helping someone with a problem on Workspaces or even the Google Cloud Platform was never going to be as profitable as helping an advertiser carpet bomb your attention span.
This is an evergreen observation, but I'm bringing it up in celebration of Google killing their domain name registrar Google Domains just now. After nine years in business, it'll unceremoniously get obliterated in just three months (and the shrapnel sold to Squarespace). That was a $180m/year business, servicing 10 million domains!
It's no better in the dead-business-walking department of Google Home / Nest. Google bought Nest almost a decade ago, and has managed to do worse than nothing with its product portfolio since. Just a few years ago they killed Nest Secure, leaving anyone who bought into that system with a bundle of bricks next year. And the Google Home app that was supposed to take over from the superior Nest app has been a multi-year stumble of embarrassment and neglect.
With a history like this, why would anyone trust Google on products and services outsides of the ad space? This goes from Workspaces to Gmail for Domains to even the Google Cloud Platform. This company is one major reorganization or recently promoted executive away from murdering any of these.
All I'm saying is you better have a backup plan. Be that for your collaboration, your email, your home security system. Anything that reads "Made by Google" implicitly has the subscript "until we don't give a fuck any more" printed below.]]></summary>

To escape back to first principles, you need to consciously turn down the volume on the world.
I credit much of the novel work we've done on product development, organizational design, and software tooling at 37signals with being far removed from the centers of Silicon Valley. Physically, spiritually, and mentally. Right from the start.
Being in Chicago in those early years of the post-dot-com-bust internet was like living in a monastery. We knew there was a party going on a hundred miles inland, but the debauchery was never so close as to color our thinking or tempt our aspirations. We were geographically destined to see the world in a different light.
This was before social media. When much of Silicon Valley's propaganda had to be carried by monthly magazines and the occasionally breathless mainstream story. Which made it so much easier to tune out. Now it's more work.
It takes concerted effort these days to escape the AI FOMO fest, say. Like it required fortitude to resist the fear of missing out on the latest coin hype before that. Every feed is there to homogenize your thinking into a preconfigured camp. For or against, hype or denounce. These are all just plusses and minuses in front of the same thinking.
If you want more than this, you ought to embrace the paradox that there are times when the less you know raises the bar for what you can do. Don't drown out our inner drumbeat by living all your days inside the permanent intellectual festival of your profession.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abilities unused will atrophy, so putting in anything less than your best means giving up on what you’re capable of. You can’t save talent or energy for better days, only watch it go to waste. This is a hard truth to accept if you don’t think your company has earned your best.


And companies make employees feel like that all the time. This is part of what drives the whole “act your wage” rebellion. Why should you put in your best if work never seems to return the favor? It’s a perfectly human response of spite in the face of unfairness, but you can’t avenge your grievances by squandering your potential.


The years will wash away quickly. If you wait for the perfect company to reveal your peak potential, it may never come. Or by the time it does come, you’re not ready, because you’re no longer who you were. You let it slip. That’s a tragedy.


Whatever the situation, whatever the company, you should show up with your very best. Not for them, but for you. Use the discontent to become better, then bolt to another camp when the opportunity presents itself.


Besides, you’ll appreciate a good place so much more if you’ve made it through some bad places.


Don’t play yourself by living down to their expectations. Show yourself the path out by shining bright whatever the weather.]]></summary>

I've never had the race go that long before getting into the car. Usually by midnight, I'll have driven at least a good two hours of the required minimum six. But this edition of Le Mans also had more drama than any of the previous nine attempts I've been part of. At the end of the race, 22 cars had retired from crashes or mechanical issues, and several more were limping home many laps down. It was mayhem.
Which started right from the words green, green, green. By the first chicane down the Mulsanne straight, a Cadillac in the class above us crashed hard immediately in front of …]]></summary>

As with every complex subject, people – me included – love to reduce it to a dichotomy. A binary choice where you can either be right or wrong. I'm in the camp of remote-work-is-the-best, but I can't deny that many folks and companies thrive with on-site work. Plenty of evidence backing up any side you want to take here.


What always surprises me is that most assume that existing companies have a choice. Generally speaking, I don't think they do. If a company obtaining good results isn't working remotely already, it will likely fail to switch…]]></summary>

Here’s the 15th installment of my popular Heard Something, Read Something, Saw Something series.
So, what do we have this time...
Heard Something
These 11 minutes will restore your faith in humanity. A student pilot loses her front nose gear on takeoff on her 3rd solo flight ever. An incredible amount of support comes in over the radio from the tower and fellow pilots, helping her keep her calm and eventually land safely. Heartwarming all around. Just listen.
Hear it: https://youtu.be/USW53vdL_0c
Read Something
Here’s a great piece on paying it backward. From music to sports to movies, Matt shares some great examples of younger, “hotter” talents shining a light on someone they’d long respected to help elevate them in the public consciousness.
Read it: https://mattruby.substack.com/p/pay-it-backward-?r=7wjyf
Saw Something
“Whoever came up with this superb bit of creativity at Target, I salute you.” You kinda wonder if it was put up this way, or if a customer did the deed. Regardless, clever!
See it: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6951158945868599296/?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web

If advice on how to run your company isn't coming at you 280 characters at a time on Twitter, you can hear it on a podcast, read it on a Substack, or get it right here on your LinkedIn feed. There's hardly a CEO, an entrepreneur, or a cultural figure these days who doesn't profess to hold some wisdom that will lead you to building a great business.
I don't think this proliferation of expertise is a particularly useful development. It's overwhelming and often contradicting. It's hard to know what's worth knowing when you don't know in the first place.
So rather than give you advice on how to take advice, I thought I'd share my personal approach to filtering it.

This reversal plot is know as hybrid work, and combines the worst of in-office and remote work worlds. The shrewd – but likely temporary – concession here is starting with three days in the office, two from home.

We're staring at two distinctly different visions of the future. They may co-exist, but they are radically different takes on what's modern, what's current, and where things are headed.
One vision gets the UI out of the way. The other vision is UI everywhere you look.
One vision gets the computer out of the way. The other vision mounts a computer on your face.
One vision is get it and go. One vision is get it and stay.
One vision fades into the background. The other vision is front and center.
One vision is about information. The other vision is about immersion.
One vision is natural and understands you. The other vision requires new methods of interaction that you have to learn and master.
One vision feels like an assist. One vision feels like obstruction.
One vision fits with whatever you already have. One vision requires you buy something that fits.
One vision is simply text. One vision is anything but.
One vision feels like before. One vision feels like after. But I'm not sure which is which.
Both are extraordinary.

Companies spend their employees’ time and attention as if there was an infinite supply of both. As if they cost nothing. Yet employees’ time and attention are among the scarcest resources we have.
At 37signals, we see it as our top job to protect our employees’ time and attention. You can’t expect people to do great work if they don’t have a full day’s attention to devote to it. Partial attention is barely attention at all.

That was basically it, and it was glorious.
In Denmark today, we have a centralized app used by all Danish public schools called Aula. Think of it as Facebook for teachers and parents. For our kid in an international school, there's a similar system. All of it sucks.
