They protect their brand with trademarks and lawsuits. They protect their data and trade secrets with rules, policies, and NDAs. They protect their money with budgets, CFOs, and investments.
They guard so many things, but all too often they fail to protect what’s both most vulnerable and precious: their employees’ time and attention.
Companies spend their employees’ time and attention as if there was an infinite supply of both. As if they cost nothing. Yet employees’ time and attention are among the scarcest resources we have.
At 37signals, we see it as our top job to protect our employees’ time and attention. You can’t expect people to do great work if they don’t have a full day’s attention to devote to it. Partial attention is barely attention at all.

 He was on the front lines as the platform transformed how programmers worked. And he embodies the spirit of Stack Overflow:  Its transparency, playfulness, and even some of its struggles to be as welcoming and friendly as it should be. 
  
 But you'll see what I mean. 
  
 So stick around as Ben takes us on a journey through the building of Stack Overflow. Get ready for a candid inside look at the creation of a platform that would become an essential part of the developer community and the internet as we know it.

Kids could bring home a flyer about some future event, they'd get their grades and remarks detailed in a little grey book, and once a year parents would come in for a chat with the teachers. That was basically it, and it was glorious.
In Denmark today, we have a centralized app used by all Danish public schools called Aula. Think of it as Facebook for teachers and parents. For our kid in an international school, there's a similar system. All of it sucks.

But the natural inclination is to promote senior contributors up a managerial ladder, and out of the trenches. This often ends poorly, turning the promotion into a punishment.
It's usually not that these potential managers don't like working with others. Quite the contrary. I've found that nothing motivates ambitious people like working close together with other talented individuals. It's also usually not that they're uncomfortable being senior, in terms of setting a direction for the work. It's that they don't want the responsibility, and associated guilt, that comes with managing others. Especially when there's a need for correction.

The rest of the time, across hundreds of reviews, it was an arduous, awkward affair of forcing people to come up with novel ways to congratulate each other on command. Dropping these 360s was perhaps one of the most popular acts of minimizing management we've ever done at 37signals.
It should have been obvious that the 360 process wasn't valuable because almost nobody wanted to do it. Getting folks to fill out their reviews required constant nagging, resulting in weeks-long procrastination. That is not the hallmark of a happy process that serves the interests of the people involved.

The traditional paradigm of a reporting manager that's constantly following up with their reports, conducting daily stand-up meetings, weekly 1-1s, and all other forms of intensive supervision, needs to be (mostly) replaced with an asynchronous, self-managing paradigm instead.
Let's look at five ways that principle works in practice at 37signals. 
First, we've replaced the commonly used daily stand-up meetings with a set of automated questions in Basecamp. On Monday mornings, we ask everyone "What are you going to work on this week?", and at the end of every day, we ask "What did you work on today?". These two recurring questions provide the key process for keeping everyo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I found that xref in Emacs had stopped working for me on my mac laptop. Today I finally tried to figure out what went wrong. xref is just a front-end, all the work is done by backends. It took a while for me to realize (ie remember) that I was using the excellent dumb-jump package as the backend. dumb-jump uses a range of fast search commands (such as ag and ripgrep) to detect references without using the awkward tags tables that Emacs used to rely on.
The command flow between xref and dumb-jump is difficult to follow, but looking at the dumb-jump customization page alerted me to dumb-jump having a debug option. With this enabled, I could see what command dumb-jump was sending to the operating system. By default it uses git grep while in a git repo (almost everything I do is in a git repo). Its git grep command is quite complex, using regexps to (I assume) get more sensible results. I tried out the command it issued in my own terminal and it failed to find anything, while a simple git grep worked fine.
Armed with a better knowledge of what was failing, I dug into dumb-jump’s issues and found Issue with git-grep. Reading that, I discovered that a change to git grep means that how git grep processes regexes differs depending on the operating system. This would mean that dumb-jump would need to detect git-grep’s version and the underlying OS to pick the right regexes for its search.
The fix for me is to force dumb-jump to use another searcher with (setq dumb-jump-force-searcher 'rg). With that my xref commands worked again.]]></summary>

But the smartest businesses — the ones that tend to stick around for the long haul — know that existence is also about avoidance.
Avoiding careening variable costs, avoiding getting involved with things that aren't core to your business, avoiding spending time on things that don't matter, avoiding bad investments, avoiding people who don't help you prosper, and even avoiding customers who aren't the right fit.
However, there's something even more fundamental to avoid. It would be easy to call it "complexity" but that's not quite it. Complexity can be necessary, and intricacy c…]]></summary>

If you are an experienced software developer whose only exposure to
reddit is dank memes, proggit or even
language-specific subreddits like
/r/python, you're missing out.
What follows are my favorite subreddits in tech. My criteria is that:
The subreddit topic is relevant to advancing as a programmer
Posts generally go into good depth
The comments stay on topic
And the shit-posting is minimal
This list isn't hard to guess at if you consider advanced topics
in software. But I wanted to share because I think it's worth
explicitly supporting high-quality subreddits.
/r/EmuDev
My favorite sub of all. Also has a phenomenal Discord group.
/r/ProgrammingLanguages
Focuses a little more on PLT topics (parsing techniques, syntax, type systems) than on compiling and interpreting techniques, but still good.
/r/DatabaseDevelopment
All about database internals, which ends up involving a bunch of
correctness and distributed systems stuff as well.
Disclosure: I run this sub. It's at 2.7k+ members at time of publishing.
/r/ReverseEngineering
The largest subreddit on this list but still has pretty good posts.
/r/EsoLangs
One of the best/most fun intros to programming languages/compilers/interpreters is through languages like Brainfuck. This sub does a good job of keeping the fun going.
/r/Compilers
/r/GraphicsProgramming
While some language subreddits are pretty good, they are more so a
mixed bag than some of the topic-specific subreddits here. So they
don't make my list, more on principle than anything else.
If there is a good one already, send me it!
What am I missing?
Am I missing other amazing subreddits? Just don't say
language-specific ones. :)

It's an incorrect meme IMO that tech Reddit is low-quality. You just have to find the interesting subreddits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are many reasons to pick working for a bigger company in tech. The benefits, the pay, and, at least until recently, the job security. In many ways, it's hard to argue with the cold logic of taking a seat on a star destroyer, if you can land one. But odds are you'll be sitting on the bench if you do.
That is, your talents won't get to play center stage in a way that really matters. If you weren't there, there'd probably just be someone else to fill the slot, and it'd rarely make a big difference either way. That's part of the resilience of a big ship, it's built to withstand whatever the weather, so much of the crew is redundant by design.
That just isn't so in a small boat. If you're not rowing, everyone will notice. You can't just rest and vest. You gotta play. That's the appeal. You gotta play.
That can be intellectually exhausting, but it's also the kind of flexing of your talents that make them grow rapidly. It's the fact that others, and the boat as a whole, count on you being there that rewards you with meaning.
Would you rather be on the bench in the big leagues or playing every game with an underdog team moving up?]]></summary>

I didn’t even let someone finish their thought before I started forming my rebuttal. The remainder of their statement was just filler before I could slam back.
I’m far from perfect, and I still occasionally catch myself doing this today, but far less frequently. And when I do it, I spot it and correct for it. I’d say I’m 90% better.
Lately I’ve been using another tool to help create some space before I form an opinion. It’s a simple word called “yet”.
Over the past years I’ve found a lot of joy in things I’d normally have dismissed. And it’s all because of “yet”.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jason just penned a beautiful, succinct ode to the underdogs. Go read it.
It's funny how finding just the right word unlocks the perfect mental image. We've often thought of ourselves as being in the corner of the small business, but that was never quite right. There are many kinds of small businesses, not all of them thinking of themselves as underdogs. But for the ones who do, those are our people.
What I love most about underdogs is how they can't help having something on the line. As Nassim Taleb would say, they have skin in the game. And it's incredible what kind of difference that makes. The easiest way to solve the agent-principle problem is to skip the agent, at least at the top.
That's why "small" never really did capture our audience or our allegiance either. 37signals isn't even technically a small business any more. We're just under eighty people. We've got over a hundred thousand customers. We have cloud bills in the millions, and revenue many times that. But we sure as hell are underdogs. Fierce and feisty ones.
There's a deep bond in that attitude. The people who connect the most with our writing, our books, our process, our tools, and our offerings usually share that underdog DNA. They might not always be as bold about it as we frequently are, but they're thinking it, and they appreciate when we give those thoughts a strong voice in the public sphere.
As Jason writes, being an underdog is an ethos: Drive. Grit. Scrappiness. Independence. Those as the signals, but they're also often dimmed by fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Are we going to make it? Will the big dogs eat our lunch? What's the next move? Helping to allay those sentiments, and encouraging someone to keep on, is what continues to give me the spark to stick with it twenty years in.
Underdogs stick together. We're making Basecamp for them.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What do they got?
A big team, lots of money, a strong brand, seemingly unlimited resources, panache, reputation, all that. They’re established.
They’re your competitors.
You want to look away, but you see them everywhere. Their ads on your social, their name in the media, your dream clients on their website.
But you know what else they got?
Bigger company bloat. Overflowing obligations. Narratives to uphold. Appearances to maintain. Entitlement. Too much overhead. 
They’re slow. They’re conservative. They talk too much. They’ve stopped taking risks. They’re resting on their laurels, gliding on their reputation. They’re on defense.
What they’ve really got is a lot to lose.
What do you got?
Hunger. Drive. Grit. Scrappiness. Independence. You’re on offense.
You don’t have enough, which is why you’re dangerous. You have no choice but to be clever and creative. To make up for what you don’t have with something they can’t have: The underdog spirit.
You can move. You can adjust. You can adapt. You can get it done while they’re still stuck deciding what to do.
Small is not a stepping stone. Small is not less than. It’s greater than. It’s faster than. It’s better than.
Savor your position. You don’t get to be the underdog forever. The baton will be passed. But for now, it’s your magic wand. Use it.
We stand with the underdogs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Throw a dart on LinkedIn, or toss one into the ether on Twitter, and you'll likely hit a post proclaiming that you better "learn AI" or you're falling behind.
Master the tools and become a prompt engineer or someone else will tell the AI to summarize the long documents, kick off initial first drafts, and rewrite the headlines for you!
Nonsense.
This isn't saying AI, ChatGPT, or whatever comes next is nonsense. It's very real, very powerful, and very here.
But there's nothing you need to learn, or do, right now, other than be curious. Play around, kick the tires, poke and prod. Get a feel for what this new sauce tastes like. Have fun, it's not a test.
But become a master at once or you're going to lose your job to some AI expert? Nah. That's pure FUD. The stuff that everyone's talking about is barely 6 months old — there are no experts, there are just people playing experts on the internet.
Besides, the best way to learn something is to need that something. Learning when you don't really need to is a good way to give up early. Learning when there's something you truly need to do, but can't, but could, is the right time to figure something out.
They say necessity is the mother of invention, but it's really the impetus for learning. The time will come, and you can figure it out then. If anything, it'll be easier to learn how to use AI once it settles in a bit. Currently it's a moving target.
So wait on it. Pop the pressure. Don't feel like you're falling behind. And don't drop everything to dig in. Start curious, stay curious, know what it's capable of, and, when the necessity strikes, figure it out. Until then, ignore the demands and focus on doing what you're already good at.

        <updated>2023-05-09T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Beginning with Rust 1.71 (slated for stable release on 2023-07-13), the various *-linux-musl targets will ship with musl 1.2.3.
These targets currently use musl 1.1.24.
While musl 1.2.3 introduces some new features, most notably 64-bit time on all platforms, it is ABI compatible with earlier musl versions.
As such, this change is unlikely to affect you.
Updated targets
The following targets will be updated:
Target
Support Tier




aarch64-unknown-linux-musl
Tier 2 with Host Tools


x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
Tier 2 with Host Tools


arm-unknown-linux-musleabi

arm-unknown-linux-musleabihf
Tier 2


armv5te-unknown-linux-musleabi

riscv64gc-unknown-linux-musl
Tier 3


s390x-unknown-linux-musl
Tier 3


thumbv7neon-unknown-linux-musleabihf
Tier 3



Note: musl 1.2.3 does not raise the minimum required Linux kernel version for any target.
Will 64-bit time break the libc crate on 32-bit targets?
No, the musl project made this change carefully preserving ABI compatibility.
The libc crate will continue to function correctly without modification.
A future version of the libc crate will update the definitions of time-related structures and functions to be 64-bit on all musl targets however this is blocked on the musl targets themselves first being updated.
At present, there is no anticipated date when this change will take place and care will be taken to help the Rust ecosystem transition successfully to the updated time-related definitions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roughly three years ago Pietro Albini opened an RFC called "crates.io token scopes". This RFC described an improvement to the existing API tokens, that everyone is using to publish crates to the crates.io package registry. The proposal was to make it possible to restrict API tokens to 1) certain operations and 2) certain crates.
Unfortunately, the crates.io team members were quite busy at the time, so it took a while for this proposal to get accepted. To be precise, during the EuroRust conference in October 2022 we talked about the RFC again and after a few modifications the RFC was moved into FCP status and then finally merged.
The implementation was started soon after, but was paused again due to other priorities at the time. Fortunately, I was lucky enough to get one of the software engineering jobs at the Rust Foundation, so in early April the development continued, and I am happy to report:
API token scopes on crates.io are now in a public beta testing period!
For details on what these token scopes are and how they are supposed to work, I recommend reading through the RFC. If you want to try them out, you can go to https://crates.io/settings/tokens/new and create a new API token scoped to the operations and crates you want:

Please note that this page is currently not reachable from the regular user interface, you have to access it via URL directly while we test it out.
Finally, if you notice any issues, or if you have any questions don't hesitate to find us on Zulip or open an issue on GitHub.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out of all things I’m asked about, hiring tops the list. From the actual hiring process, to reviews, to motivation and retention strategies, curiosity about hiring is on full charge.
There’s a lot to cover, but I’d like to share some thoughts about a moment that doesn’t get enough attention: The end of the first year and the beginning of the second.
Hiring is typically thought of as something you do once per person. Once someone’s hired, training, growing, and retaining are the next things you do. You may keep training someone, you may keep growing someone, you may keep promoting someone, but you surely don’t keep hiring someone.
It’s on that point I disagree.
I’ve found that, actually, you hire someone at least twice. You hire someone initially, and then, if all goes well, you hire them a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You're never getting me back into an office. I credit much of my career to escaping that place in the early 2000s. It wasn't until I found the prolonged solitude of working from home that I could consistently make big leaps in my creative process. The pandemic taught millions the same lesson. And yet – AND YET! – I'm going to come to the defense of the office. 
Because I find it so nonsensical to hear remote-work advocates proclaim the universal, moral superiority of abolishing the office, as I did listening to those who couldn't envision productive work from home just a few minutes ago. Let's be real here. The modern world we live in was designed and executed from an office. It's a perfectly legitimate way of working.
It may not be your preferred way of working. It sure as hell isn't mine…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the longest running schisms in programming is that of static vs dynamic typing. I've heard a million arguments from both sides throughout my entire career, but seen very few of them ever convinced anyone of anything. As rationalizations masquerading as reason rarely do in matters of faith. The rider will always justify the way of the elephant.
That's not to say there aren't people who've switched camps. In fact, such individuals usually shout the loudest rationalizations of all. Often with the charm of a livelong omnivore suddenly turning vegan or a traditional banker who caught a lucky ride on crypto. The shorter the faith, the brighter the flame.
Personally, I'm unashamedly a dynamic typing kind of guy. That's why I love Ruby so very much. It takes full advantage of dynamic typing…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If I'm stuck in a creative downturn, there's usually only one remedy: keep going. That is, accept the downturn, but continue to stare at the computer, waiting for it to pass. While staring at the computer, there's room for menial and managerial tasks put aside during more inspired times. Checking up on things, getting back to people, and reading copious amount of internet. But it's still a creative deadzone.
Then the curse is usually broken when I'm sufficiently bored with the menial, the managerial, and the internet. That's the moment the creativity returns. When all the distractions have been drained of their doldrum. When there is literally nothing better to do than open the editor and code. 
I usually hit these downturns after a dopamine high, like one propelled by a particularly intense creative period. From working fervently on an idea, seeing it bloom, and then feeling the release of summer. As if fall must follow the flowers. As if the creative juices really are juices, and you can chug the jug. 
But it can also happen after being out of the routine for too long. Maybe a particularly bad streak of weeks filled with meetings or travel. Like the mind has to settle back into a comfortable groove before sprouting again.
I used to be more impatient with this oscillating process. Overly eager to get back riding high again. But as I've grown older, I've come to terms with the fact that it can't be eternal sunshine in the productive mind. You need to let weather pass. The grey, wet days of today soak the soil for the sun of tomorrow.
Complaining about the rain won't do you any good, anyway. Don't argue with nature. Just wait. It'll be bright before you know it.]]></summary>

It’s been many months since my last installment of the Heard Something, Read Something, Saw Something series. Let’s get back into it.
So, what do we have this time...
Heard Something
A buddy randomly sent me this Turkish Electro Funk Güzel Mix on YouTube. This wasn’t on my radar at all, which is all the more reason I was glad he sent it.
Hear it: https://youtu.be/DQWokgdyeYw
Read Something
19 sharks were all found in the same condition: missing their livers, which had been sucked out through a clean tear in their shoulders. The rest of their organs remained intact. Who’s performing such surgery at sea, and possibly teaching others how to do it as well?
Read it: https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/animals/2023/03/why-are-these-orcas-killing-sharks-and-removing-their-livers
Saw Something
I can look at Slime Molds all day. Their forms, textures, and wide, whimsical variety are sublimely captivating. Here’s a good collection to get you started:
