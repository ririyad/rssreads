It's been over three years since my last blog post. I think that
the website code started to feel like it had bitrotted, and so making new blog
posts became onerous. But I've taken the time to redo this website
using Zig, so it's quite easy to add blog
posts now, and plus I added
dark mode.
Twitter
Over the past few years I amassed a healthy number of followers on Twitter by posting
screenshots, demos, and small progress updates for the Zig programming language. It
felt good to gain an audience and have my perspective and efforts weighed more heavily in
the court of public opinion.
However, I always knew that it would need to end. It's not really possible to use Twitter
without at least a little bit of doomscrolling, and that activity took a toll on me emotional…]]></summary>

Scatter is pulling people off this to jump on that.


Scatter is wondering where something is rather than knowing where it lives.

     consumed by other software and thus without any user-interface. Such
     services are hard to demonstrate, as they effectively just dump pages of

     manipulate such an API. Matteo Vaccari describes how and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here is a new article in the bottlenecks of scaleups series, looking at
     resilience and observability. Startups tend to only address resilience when
     their systems are already down, often taking a very reactive approach. For
     a scaleup, excessive system downtime represents a significant
     bottleneck to the organization, both from the effort expended on
     restoring function and also from the impact of customer dissatisfaction.
     Punit Lad and Carl Nygard explain that to
     move past this, resilience needs to be built into the business objectives,
     which will influence the architecture, design, product management, and even
     governance of business systems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is complex and there is difficult, they are not the same. 


Being able to run a marathon is very difficult. But what you have to do to prepare is simple. A small sheet of paper is enough to describe the steps. You will need tremendous effort and discipline - so it’s hard - but it is simple.


Software development is different: it is also complex.


A common theme in my articles on how we do Rails at 37signals is how facing software development with rigid recipes is naive and counterproductive. A good example is services: using a service for everything is a simple idea; applying domain-driven design and object orientation is not. Another manifestation is banning techniques because they can be harmful: concerns, accessing the database from models, callbacks, globals, etc. Ironically, the alternative critics usually recommend for those is using services.


In software, you must take a Babylonian body of knowledge, combine it with your own experience, and apply the result to make countless daily decisions. And of all this for a problem you can’t understand without solving it first. Rigidity doesn’t work, and – because this is a game of intricate complexity – it yields more harm than benefit. You need to embrace nuance.


Mind the recipes you follow.

While the rest of the industry was stuck competing on the size of their panel gaps, and other aspects of precision and quality assembly, Tesla didn't even show up to participate. Their cars are legendary for being delivered with shoddy paint jobs, rattling interiors, and even mismatched doors. But it just didn't matter! Consumers voted with their wallets for poorly built EVs because well-built gas-powered cars were deemed irrelevant in comparison.
There's tremendous wisdom for product makers of all kinds in this lesson. It's the epitome of Blue Ocean Strategy. To find a breakthrough angle in commerce, it's as important to decide where you will not compe…]]></summary>

Be that a product, an organization, or a community, or all three at once. Like exercise, it's one of those rare avenues of human endeavor that almost invariably will make anyone feel better. And, also like exercise, the hard part is getting started when you need it the most!
That's the curious chasm between knowledge and action. As much as you may know that regular, high-intensity training of the body does wonders for the mind, summoning the motivation to follow through with a commitment to working out only gets harder and harder the more you need it. I've had periods in my life where being removed from meaningful acts of creation felt just the same way.
Those periods were especially depressing when they felt like a simulacra of creation. Being in a situation designed to mimic the motions of making, but bereft of any meaningful progress towards that end. The pretending of purpose. The appearance of collaboration. Without any thrust towards completion.
And just as how getting a positive streak of accomplishment going provides its own momentum to keep at it, so too does a negative streak of performative busyness. It pulls you back into the comfort of the mental couch, and hands you the bag of chips to soothe your nagging sense of uselessness. For every day you stay there, the harder it is to get up, so best to muster everything you got to escape the dulling inertia now.
Make something. Participate in something. Engage with someone. All of it might feel as unnatural as strapping on those running shoes after too long of a break, but once you're back to creating, the energy comes by itself.]]></summary>

The company that literally lives to sell us all on the wonders of remote collaboration wants its own people back into the office again. Which I guess is just a regression to the mean of productivity tool makers failing to believe their own marketing, but it's a bit sad none the less.
Not the least because this push for return-to-office has now been proven completely safe for large tech corporations. Thanks to the mixture of mass layoffs earlier this year and the now numerous proclamations that remote-first is over at the majority of big companies. Safety in sentiment, safety in numbers.
This is an opportunistic squeeze, because what's most tech workers supposed to do? The option of simply hopping to another company has been severely limited. Outside the small realm of AI experts, most other domains just aren't anywhere nearly as contested in hiring as they once were. So this is happening now because it can happen now.
I just hope that people who really did enjoy that remote work-lifetyle don't forget what it was like. The balance of power will presumably turn around one day again, and when it does, voting with your feet will be an option again.
Until then, I suspect that the likes of Shopify, Automattic, and other stalwart defenders of remote work will continue to see their openings become increasingly oversubscribed. Just like we've had at 37signals for going on two decades.
Remote work might be receding, but it's simply too compelling an option for too many to ever disappear. The long-term trend line ain't going anywhere.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Rust team has published a new point release of Rust, 1.71.1. Rust is a
programming language that is empowering everyone to build reliable and
efficient software.
If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, getting Rust
1.71.1 is as easy as:
rustup update stable

If you don't have it already, you can get rustup from the
appropriate page on our website.
What's in 1.71.1 stable
Rust 1.71.1 fixes Cargo not respecting the umask when extracting dependencies,
which could allow a local attacker to edit the cache of extracted source code
belonging to another local user, potentially executing code as another user.
This security vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2023-38497, and you can read
more about it on the advisory we published earlier today. We
recommend all users to update their toolchain as soon as possible.
Rust 1.71.1 also addresses several regressions introduced in Rust 1.71.0,
including bash completion being broken for users of Rustup, and the
suspicious_double_ref_op being emitted when calling borrow() even though it
shouldn't.
You can find more detailed information on the specific regressions, and other
minor fixes, in the release notes.
Contributors to 1.71.1
Many people came together to create Rust 1.71.1. We couldn't have done it
without all of you. Thanks!]]></summary>

official advisory contains a signed version with our PGP key, as well.
The Rust Security Response WG was notified that Cargo did not respect the umask

crate containing files writeable by any local user, another local user could
exploit this to change the source code compiled and executed by the current

This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2023-38497.
Overview
In UNIX-like systems, each file has three sets of permissions: for the user
owning the file, for the group owning the file, and for all other local users.
The "umask" is configured on most systems to limit those permissions
during file creation, removing dangerous ones. For example, the de…]]></summary>

After two and a half years, we've decided its time to rotate the leadership again!
Welcome David Wood
Felix Klock is stepping down from his role as senior lead and David Wood is joining Wesley Wiser as the new junior lead for the team.
Felix remains a valued member of the compiler team (and also the language design team).
Felix will be focusing on reducing the sizes of Rust futures, and on improving the state of the art for authoring Unsafe Rust, via projects such as Krabcake.
David has been a contributor to the Rust project since 2017, a compiler-contributor since 2019 and became a compiler team member in 2021.
His contributions include work on the diagnostic translation effort, split DWARF support, polymorphisation, non-lexical lifetimes initiative and general maintenance to the compiler.
David has also been a contributor to the governance and organization of the compiler team itself via policy proposals and regular participation in our weekly triage and steering meetings.
Felix and I are excited to welcome David into this leadership role and I am thrilled to be working alongside him.]]></summary>

Sacrificing purity for convenience is one of the Rails pillars. This principle informs several Rails features that some recommend avoiding but that we happily use in our apps. In this post, I’ll discuss how we use three of those in Basecamp.

I’ll show some examples involving projects. In Basecamp, a Bucket represents a top-level container of data, and there are several types of buckets, one of which is a Project. Internally, we implement this with delegated type attribute, where a Bucket has an associated Bucketable. A Bucket can contain many Events, and an Event is a holder for information on the related request, such as the IP or the transaction id (Event::Request) and some additional information (Event::Detail).

Scarcely a month goes by without some action triggering the incessant bells of doom, ringing from the bellies of bloviating ding dongs. And the ringing seemingly never stops long enough to allow for some basic contemplation or correction, as reality wrecks another prediction of peril.


But the obsession with all things Elon is so strong that there’s no room or time for introspection of any kind. It’s just on to the next faux outrage of tomorrow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As more and more companies, especially large ones, have started demanding remote workers return to the office, the competitive hiring advantage for remote-first companies is back. And it's even bigger than before the pandemic, now that so many workers have had a taste of what life can be like when you don't have to commute to the office. This is great news for smaller companies and startups in particular.
Let's face it, if you're trying to compete for talent with the likes of Google or Apple, you need all the help you can get, and these companies forcing everyone back into an office might just be your biggest lift. Because for quite a few people, working remotely or not has become the defining characteristic of a job. To the point where many remote workers won't even consider a position th…]]></summary>

    company, requires a lot of people - and whenever you have a lot of people
    you have to figure out how to divide them into effective teams. Forming
    Business Capability Centric teams helps software efforts to
    be responsive to customers’ needs, but the range of skills required often
    overwhelms such teams. Team Topologies is a model
    for describing the organization of software development teams,

  that fully supports software for a particular business capability. The term
  became popular as it used to describe how Amazon organized their software staff.
The name suggests the most obvious aspect of such teams, their size. The
  name comes from the principle that the team should no larger than can be fed
  with two pizzas. (Although we are talking about American Pizzas here, which
  seemed alarmingly huge when I first encountered them over here.) Keeping a
  team small keeps it cohesive, forming tight working relationships. Typically I
  hear this means such teams are about 5-8 people, although my experience
  suggests that the upper limit is somewhere about 15.
Although the name focuses solely on the size, just as important is the
