On the one hand, energy is more reliable than happiness. I liked this reflection by Jocko Willink in the Huberman podacast. Everyone experiences joy and sadness as part of their daily lives: keeping a certain energy level is more feasible than a certain level of happiness.


On the other hand, as with anything related to habits, it's way easier to preach than practice. Many years ago, someone I love dearly told me that he tried to do more of what he liked and less of what he didn't. I remember thinking, "Doh, what a naive approach to life". Now I think there is deep wisdom there. Your internal energy is the result of a balance. You can have more money by either making more or spending less; you need to pay attention to both.

I'd probably still wager that the fears are overstated – that we also got prematurely euphoric about the imminent prospects of self-driving cars – and that AI generating code is different from it evolving existing systems. But I wouldn't want to bet the house on it. This might just be The Big One.
That uncertainty, whether we truly are on the cusp of a total transformation, is a surprising novelty to me, despite thirty years in software.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday I was speaking to a university class and, as it usually does, a question about innovation came up.


"How do you stay innovative? How do you encourage innovative thinking at work?"


My answer: You don't stay innovative and you don't encourage innovative thinking at work.


WHAT? Yes.


Innovation should almost never happen. It's incredibly rare. It mostly happens by accident, not by intention. It's wonderful when it does, but you merely fluctuate in and out of it, it's not steady state.


Work is mostly mundane. It's mostly maintenance. It's mostly local improvement and iteration. Work is mostly... Work. Any innovation is an outlier, nearly a rounding error.


Even the most innovative projects or products are full of rote, prosaic stuff that still needs building. The poetic magic may be in the 5%, but the bulk of the work is in the other 95.


So I told the students they'd better get used to that. Work is not often very exciting, but it can absolutely be fulfilling. And you can be excited about that. But if you're expecting breakthroughs all the time, riff sessions that constantly lead somewhere new, or brainstorms that shoot lightning, you're going to be disappointed.


Yes innovation happens. Occasionally. Being happy at work is about finding challenge, reward, growth, and creative and intellectual stimulation in everything else.


Now... back to this new product we're building.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our 2023 marketing campaign for Basecamp kicked off on a ton of different channels at once. Web ads, search ads, podcast ads, and TV ads all blasted the message of JUST LET ME DO MY JOB. Our flagship commercial was a hit with the audience and the critics. But our attempt at out-of-home advertising, with billboards all over Boston, was a bust at a $300,000 cost.


    
      
        

    
      
        

    
      
        

  

That's advertisement! It's hard to know what's going to work unless you give it a go. And since we're fighting competitors with one hand behind our back by refusing to use privacy-invasive ads targeted on personal data, we thought it was worth trying some more conventional channels, like billboards. But at least for software like Basecamp, it's clear that isn't likely to work.
It's not that it did nothing. We did have 98 billboards all over Boston for about a month. But the effect was only barely measurable:
  
      
        

  
As you can see, we were at the top end of the predicted normal range, or even slightly above. But even with that, we ended up spending thousands of dollars on every attributable trial signup. Way outside the realm of anything we could claim a return on, even if you factored in a fair bit of long-run brand awareness.
I will say that it felt pretty cool to see the irreverent Basecamp marketing messages appear on building-hugging billboards. There was an emotionally gratifying return on the investment. And perhaps that explains why it used to be common to see business software advertised in places like San Francisco where a lot of executives of such companies could feel good about seeing them. There's something gratifying about being in the real world like this.
But yeah, it didn't work. We won't be doing that again. But we'll always have the pictures 😄]]></summary>

Scott has been very active in the past year, working on various parts of Cargo, namely implementing workspace inheritance. Since then, he has been helping with maintenance and designing new features.
With their help we now have capacity to start thinking about how feature development should be done moving forward. We are still in early discussions of processes for matching feature development with reviewer capacity, and will share more in the future.

One of the things that makes something simply useful is a clear line from problem to solution. From hassle to effortlessness. From a lot of time to nearly no time at all. From creating work to eliminating work.
So let's trace Reply to Everyone back to the initial germ of the idea.
It all started with frustration. This is a great place to start any feature. In fact, the closer you start to frustration, the more fuel you have to burn up the problem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent discussions with my colleagues showed that many software teams
     still run into trouble because they pack too much planned
     work into their iterations. Teams will usually run better when they have
     deliberate Slack, as it allows their delivery to be more predictable and
     gives them time to improve their environment.
While writing that bliki post, I also defined two styles of task
     planning in agile projects. Timeboxed Iterations are used to
     break up work into small chunks with a regular cadence to reassess the work
     and future plans. Using a little ceremony around allocating work to
     iterations helps make problems visible so that they can be dealt with
     properly. Continuous Flow
     dispenses with that ceremony, so skilled teams often prefer it.

He's sharing the story of JSON, his discovery of JavaScript's good parts, and his approach to finding a simple way to build software. Also, his battles against XML, against complexity, his battles to say that there's a better way to build software.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most important techniques I've embraced for managing my time is to direct related tasks to a bucket, let that bucket accumulate until full, then empty it all in one go. This in contrast to trying to catch every task the moment it lands from the myriad of interruption pipes that'll drip-drip-drip your day away if you let them. Nowhere is the most evident than with email.
I used to take such pride in inbox zero when I was still using Gmail. I'd check email continuously throughout the day, and I'd get back to almost everyone immediately. Whether it was urgent or not. Just so I could see that sweet zero. It felt very productive. It was not.
Every email is a drop, and every drop ripples the surface of your mind. It's careless to let them hit without a filter. Your attention will have…]]></summary>

Whether on guns or healthcare or taxes or any other major policy position that's so fiercely contested in the US. Despite growing up in this little Nordic country, I didn't fully appreciate the tremendous, underpinning power of a homogenous culture to fasten all these planks of a socially-democratic state – until I returned after 15 years Over There. I do now.
Denmark is a notoriously difficult country to integrate in. Not only because the language difficult, but because the people are too! I say this with all the love and respect of a Dane that continues to marvel at what a high-trust, high-coherence society these former Vikings have managed to construct. But it's true. Danes are ever so …]]></summary>

He was frustrated with an employee who kept asking him what to do if x, y, or z happens. This was a long-time employee who'd been in these situations before, not someone new who was learning the ropes.
With this particular employee, it's always the same set of questions no matter the situation. It could be a call with a client. If could be a meeting with another department. It could be a conversation with a vendor. What if they bring this up...? What if they bring that up...? What should I say if they say...? What about if they...? Essentially this employee wanted to be prepared for every contingency in a given situation. And they were great when everything went as anticipated.
Being prepared sounds like a good …]]></summary>

        <id>https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/03/28/Rust-1.68.2.html</id>
        <link href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/03/28/Rust-1.68.2.html"/>
        <updated>2023-03-28T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Rust team has published a new point release of Rust, 1.68.2. Rust is a
programming language that is empowering everyone to build reliable and
efficient software.
If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, you can get 1.68.2 with:
rustup update stable

If you don't have it already, you can get rustup
from the appropriate page on our website, and check out the
detailed release notes for 1.68.2 on GitHub.
What's in 1.68.2 stable
Rust 1.68.2 addresses GitHub's recent rotation of their RSA SSH host
key, which
happened on March 24th 2023 after their previous key accidentally leaked:
GitHub's RSA key bundled in Cargo has been
updated, to ensure systems
that haven't interacted with GitHub yet won't connect trusting the leaked
key.
The leaked key has been hardcoded as revoked in
Cargo, to ensure the key
won't be used by Cargo even on systems that still trust the key.
Support for @revoked entries in
.ssh/known_hosts (along with
a better error message when the unsupported @cert-authority entries are used)
is also included in Rust 1.68.2, as that change was a pre-requisite for
backporting the hardcoded revocation.
If you cannot upgrade to Rust 1.68.2, we recommend following GitHub's
instructions
on updating the trusted keys in your system. Note that the keys bundled in
Cargo are only used if no trusted key for github.com is found on the system.
Contributors to 1.68.2
Many people came together to create Rust 1.68.2. We couldn't have done it
without all of you. Thanks!]]></summary>
