        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The corporate cause for return-to-office just claimed its perhaps most ironic victim: Zoom! The company that literally lives to sell us all on the wonders of remote collaboration wants its own people back into the office again. Which I guess is just a regression to the mean of productivity tool makers failing to believe their own marketing, but it's a bit sad none the less.
Not the least because this push for return-to-office has now been proven completely safe for large tech corporations. Thanks to the mixture of mass layoffs earlier this year and the now numerous proclamations that remote-first is over at the majority of big companies. Safety in sentiment, safety in numbers.
This is an opportunistic squeeze, because what's most tech workers supposed to do? The option of simply hopping to another company has been severely limited. Outside the small realm of AI experts, most other domains just aren't anywhere nearly as contested in hiring as they once were. So this is happening now because it can happen now.
I just hope that people who really did enjoy that remote work-lifetyle don't forget what it was like. The balance of power will presumably turn around one day again, and when it does, voting with your feet will be an option again.
Until then, I suspect that the likes of Shopify, Automattic, and other stalwart defenders of remote work will continue to see their openings become increasingly oversubscribed. Just like we've had at 37signals for going on two decades.
Remote work might be receding, but it's simply too compelling an option for too many to ever disappear. The long-term trend line ain't going anywhere.]]></summary>

In contrast, nobody seems to have trouble with the fact that not every soccer player who loves the game and trains their best will become eligible for the Premier League. Or that becoming a brain surgeon might indeed really be harder than making it as a general practitioner, which in itself is hard enough too!

        <updated>2023-08-03T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Rust team has published a new point release of Rust, 1.71.1. Rust is a
programming language that is empowering everyone to build reliable and
efficient software.
If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, getting Rust
1.71.1 is as easy as:
rustup update stable

If you don't have it already, you can get rustup from the
appropriate page on our website.
What's in 1.71.1 stable
Rust 1.71.1 fixes Cargo not respecting the umask when extracting dependencies,
which could allow a local attacker to edit the cache of extracted source code
belonging to another local user, potentially executing code as another user.
This security vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2023-38497, and you can read
more about it on the advisory we published earlier today. We
recommend all users to update their toolchain as soon as possible.
Rust 1.71.1 also addresses several regressions introduced in Rust 1.71.0,
including bash completion being broken for users of Rustup, and the
suspicious_double_ref_op being emitted when calling borrow() even though it
shouldn't.
You can find more detailed information on the specific regressions, and other
minor fixes, in the release notes.
Contributors to 1.71.1
Many people came together to create Rust 1.71.1. We couldn't have done it
without all of you. Thanks!]]></summary>

official advisory contains a signed version with our PGP key, as well.
The Rust Security Response WG was notified that Cargo did not respect the umask
when extracting crate archives on UNIX-like systems. If the user downloaded a
crate containing files writeable by any local user, another local user could
exploit this to change the source code compiled and executed by the current
user.
This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2023-38497.
Overview
In UNIX-like systems, each file has three sets of permissions: for the user
owning the file, for the group owning the file, and for all other local users.
The "umask" is configured on most systems to limit those permissions
during file creation, removing dangerous ones. For example, the de…]]></summary>

After two and a half years, we've decided its time to rotate the leadership again!
Welcome David Wood
Felix Klock is stepping down from his role as senior lead and David Wood is joining Wesley Wiser as the new junior lead for the team.
Felix remains a valued member of the compiler team (and also the language design team).
Felix will be focusing on reducing the sizes of Rust futures, and on improving the state of the art for authoring Unsafe Rust, via projects such as Krabcake.
David has been a contributor to the Rust project since 2017, a compiler-contributor since 2019 and became a compiler team member in 2021.
His contributions include work on the diagnostic translation effort, split DWARF support, polymorphisation, non-lexical lifetimes initiative and general maintenance to the compiler.
David has also been a contributor to the governance and organization of the compiler team itself via policy proposals and regular participation in our weekly triage and steering meetings.
Felix and I are excited to welcome David into this leadership role and I am thrilled to be working alongside him.]]></summary>

Sacrificing purity for convenience is one of the Rails pillars. This principle informs several Rails features that some recommend avoiding but that we happily use in our apps. In this post, I’ll discuss how we use three of those in Basecamp.

I’ll show some examples involving projects. In Basecamp, a Bucket represents a top-level container of data, and there are several types of buckets, one of which is a Project. Internally, we implement this with delegated type attribute, where a Bucket has an associated Bucketable. A Bucket can contain many Events, and an Event is a holder for information on the related request, such as the IP or the transaction id (Event::Request) and some additional information (Event::Detail).

     technology leaders in Germany. She's now moved into a new role coordinating

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As more and more companies, especially large ones, have started demanding remote workers return to the office, the competitive hiring advantage for remote-first companies is back. And it's even bigger than before the pandemic, now that so many workers have had a taste of what life can be like when you don't have to commute to the office. This is great news for smaller companies and startups in particular.
Let's face it, if you're trying to compete for talent with the likes of Google or Apple, you need all the help you can get, and these companies forcing everyone back into an office might just be your biggest lift. Because for quite a few people, working remotely or not has become the defining characteristic of a job. To the point where many remote workers won't even consider a position th…]]></summary>

  that fully supports software for a particular business capability. The term
  became popular as it used to describe how Amazon organized their software staff.
The name suggests the most obvious aspect of such teams, their size. The
  name comes from the principle that the team should no larger than can be fed
  with two pizzas. (Although we are talking about American Pizzas here, which
  seemed alarmingly huge when I first encountered them over here.) Keeping a
  team small keeps it cohesive, forming tight working relationships. Typically I
  hear this means such teams are about 5-8 people, although my experience
  suggests that the upper limit is somewhere about 15.

But it still remains just guessing, and the truth doesn't emerge until you afford the hire a full attempt on a real project.
That's why I'm such a fan of starting new employees in the deep end. Putting them to work on a real project right away. But this is only half the commitment you ought to make to their potential.

Accomplishments so far
In our first post, we wrote:
In the coming weeks we will be establishing the basic infrastructure for the group, including creating a plan for regular meetings and a process for raising agenda items, setting up a team repository, and ultimately completing the transition from the former Rust leadership structures.
We have made progress on each of these things.
For the last month we have been holding weekly meetings and will continue to do so for at least the next month. In the long term,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The easiest way to squander your focus is by paying attention to a million inconsequential things at once. These little mental barnacles add up in imperceptible ways until you suddenly feel like you're getting nowhere, no matter how hard you push. You must keep scrubbing your mind clear of such attention-sapping colonies to remain capable of making smooth, swift progress.
These barnacles can accumulate from middling marketing initiatives, process theatre, and tolerance for mediocre performance. All individually presenting as more hassle to deal with than to dismiss, but combined killing the efficiency and focus on progress.
But they can also be things that actually appears to be working well enough, just not up to the bar of your very best. Those are the tricky ones. The base hits, the modest accomplishments, the things you might even have celebrated once. The past darlings.
It just doesn't matter. You can't keep stuffing your head with ever more things to pay partial attention to every month and expect to keep a clear eye on the horizon and the future. There's only room for so much.
The hardest part about this is not to wait until it's too much, until the drag is actually there. Keep your mind below carrying capacity, such that there's room for serendipity, at all times.
In short, be decisive about what you'll no longer do. Summon your inner Jack Welch to cut at least the bottom 10% of the stuff dragging your attention every few months or so.]]></summary>

Summary
On 2023-07-20 between 12:17 and 12:30 UTC all crate downloads from crates.io were broken due to a deployment that contained a bug in the download URL generation.
During this time we had an average of 4.71K requests per second to crates.io, resulting in about 3.7M failed requests, including the retry attempts from cargo.
The incident was noticed by the developer triggering the production deployment after seeing elevated request-per-second numbers in our monitoring dashboard after the deployment. At this point the root cause for the elevated numbers was not clear yet, but a community member notified the developer via Zulip.
Immediately after the notification, the broken deployment was rolled back to the pre…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So much talk about hacking productivity these days. There’s an endless stream of methodologies and tools promising to make you more productive. But more productive at what?
Productivity is for machines, not for people. There’s nothing meaningful about packing some number of work units into some amount of time or squeezing more into less.
Machines can work 24/7; humans can’t.
When people focus on productivity, they end up focusing on being busy. Filling every moment with something to do. And there’s always more to do!
We don’t believe in busyness at Basecamp. We believe in effectiveness. How little can we do? How much can we cut out? Instead of adding to-dos, we add to-don’ts.
Being productive is about occupying your time—filling your schedule to the brim and getting as much as you can. Being effective is about finding more of your time unoccupied and open for other things besides work. Time for leisure, time for family and friends. Or time for doing absolutely nothing.
Yes, it’s perfectly okay to have nothing to do. Or, better yet, nothing worth doing. If you’ve only got three hours of work to do on a given day, then stop. Don’t fill your day with five more just to stay busy or feel productive. Not doing something that isn’t worth doing is a wonderful way to spend your time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Getting anything new off the ground usually requires a tremendous amount of urgency. It's hard to launch something  from nothing into reality without being incredibly impatient for progress. Thus most founders begin 🎶Their Journey🎶 sprinting from one pressing problem to the next in rapid succession to achieve their lift off. But reaching escape velocity doesn't guarantee you'll keep going, unless you retain the propulsion from an unreasonable sense of urgency.
Yet the irony of being successful in business is that it'll invariably attract smart people who can tell you all the good reasons for why you can no longer go as quickly as you once did. Why it's actually natural, perhaps even good, that a company ten or a hundred times the size of what it was when it first became successful now has to travel at half the pace to be prudent.
Don't listen too closely. Not because they'll be wrong in any narrow technical sense, but because they're wrong in the broad directional sense. The risk of succumbing to the rigor mortis of success is usually far greater than the risk of making a mistake by not considering and mitigating all possible bad outcomes up front.
It's the risk of mandating everyone put on a bike helmet, only to realize that doing so means fewer people will bike, leading to worse health outcomes for all. Being obsessive about specific, short-term risks often sits in opposition to worrying about fuzzy, long-term risks.
And nobody will be as motivated as a founder to inject risk into the business. Sticking with an unreasonable sense of urgency undoubtedly comes with clear and immediate risks. But giving up on it with even worse, less defined ones.
So don't give up. Every company needs to have someone asking why we can't launch next Monday instead of next month. Willing to accept and underwrite the risks needed to make it happen. And with a stomach for occasionally being wrong, eating the loss, but keep playing.]]></summary>

The market as a whole is up, and if you're in the whole market, you're benefitting. But all of that upside, basically, belongs to just a handful of mega tech companies. 
This is not a general turn-around, and it's barely a turn-around at all for the unprofitable SaaS companies that saw their bubble burst last year. In software, only cash spigots like Apple and Microsoft are able to set fresh all-time highs. Investors who bought into money pits like Asana, Monday, or Smartsheet are still likely to be in despair over their evaporated values.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What you see above is a 17-day sales sequence, or cadence. A friend of mine just sent it over and it creeped me out.
From email to LinkedIn to phone to email back to LinkedIn back to phone, and so on. I assume day 18 would be a bullhorn outside your window.
Somehow this is allowed to be called sales. But in any other realm it would be called stalking.
The sales industry calls these moments "touches", which is even creepier. And then, check out that last one: The break up email. Ouch.
Imagine if you ran this playbook when trying to sell yourself in a new relationship (or save yourself in a failing one). You meet someone new, and you contact them 15 times in a variety of ways over 17 days. And sometimes multiple times a day after they've already ignored your earlier attempts. They'd be right in calling the cops and getting a restraining order.
I know this isn't how sales always works, but it's prevalent enough. I've been on the receiving end before. It's just wrong, even if it "works" sometimes.
Clean up in aisle sales! Something's broken.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As announced in the Types Team announcement post at the start of this year, the Types Team has started to reimplement the trait solver of rustc. This refactor is similar to Chalk, but directly integrated into the existing codebase using the experience gathered over the last few years. Unlike Chalk, the new trait solver has the sole goal of replacing the existing implementation. We are separately working on formalizing the type system in a-mir-formality. It has now been half a year since that announcement which matches the first step of our roadmap.
By reimplementing the trait solver of rustc we are able to fix many subtle bugs and inefficiencies of the existing implementation. This should result in faster compilation speed and fewer bugs. The new trait solver implementation should also unb…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Way back when we launched the first version of Basecamp in 2004, we ran all our credit card charges through a merchant account provided by JP Morgan Chase.
Charging credit cards wasn't easy in the early 2000s. This was back when being an "internet company" was a major red flag. The process required mounds of paperwork, proof, and business model scrutiny just to get approved. Barely capable, ancient APIs sorta kinda let you hook into internal systems. Charging a card successfully felt like a miracle. You had no idea. It wasn't years later until companies like Stripe made it simple.
While you were never really happy with the service, you had to have it. And switching to another service meant going through the whole ungainly process again. And the grass was probably browner.
However, one day …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's so much chatter and advice out there about how to handle "the competition".
How much should you worry about them, what you can do to beat them, how much should you pay attention to what they're doing, how you should respond when they release or say something new, what you should say when a customer compares you to them, etc.
Essentially, lots of they's and them's.
Of course you compete in a market with multiple options, but that's not your real competition.
Your real competition are your costs. Yours, not theirs. You, not them.
You ultimately stay in business when you make more money than you spend. The amount you make depends on a number of factors, many surprisingly far outside your control.
But one of the few controls you have in business is cost control. Bills don't materialize…]]></summary>

Do open source / don’t do it.

Small and risky / large and secure.
Work for others / work for yourself.

Those are examples of dichotomies that enter my radar from time to time. Usually, someone criticizes someone else’s position after performing some intellectual judo to vilify it.


Whenever I see people telling others how to live, I can’t help wondering: isn’t figuring out what works for you already difficult enough?
