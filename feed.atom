One of the things that makes something simply useful is a clear line from problem to solution. From hassle to effortlessness. From a lot of time to nearly no time at all. From creating work to eliminating work.
So let's trace Reply to Everyone back to the initial germ of the idea.
It all started with frustration. This is a great place to start any feature. In fact, the closer you start to frustration, the more fuel you have to burn up the problem.

     work into their iterations. Teams will usually run better when they have
     deliberate Slack, as it allows their delivery to be more predictable and
     gives them time to improve their environment.
While writing that bliki post, I also defined two styles of task
     planning in agile projects. Timeboxed Iterations are used to
     break up work into small chunks with a regular cadence to reassess the work
     and future plans. Using a little ceremony around allocating work to
     iterations helps make problems visible so that they can be dealt with
     properly. Continuous Flow

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m always amazed by the power of technology and the creativity of people who use it. Today I want to share with you a project that I did for fun and learning. It’s about how to use Tailscale Funnel to host a Headscale server from behind NAT. Sounds crazy, right? Let me explain.
Tailscale Funnel is a tool that lets you share a web service on your private network with the public internet. It’s like having your own personal cloud without the hassle of setting up servers and domains. Headscale is a tool that lets you create your own Tailscale control plane. It’s like having your own private VPN without relying on a third-party service.
Now, what if you could combine these two tools and create a network that uses Tailscale without using Tailscale? That’s exactly what I did. I used waifud, NixOS, and Funnel to create a virtual machine that runs Headscale and exposes it to the internet. Then I used Funnel to connect other devices to this network and enjoy the benefits of Tailscale.
Why did I do this? Because I love learning new things and challenging myself. Because I believe in the power of open source and decentralized solutions. Because I wanted to have some fun and make some jokes along the way.
This project taught me a lot about networking, security, and automation. It also showed me how much potential there is in tools like Tailscale and Headscale. And it made me laugh at the absurdity of using Tailscale without using Tailscale.
If you’re curious about how I did this, you can check out my blog post where I explain everything in detail. It’s not a serious tutorial, but rather a playful experiment.
I hope this post inspires you to try new things and have fun with technology. Remember, nothing is impossible if you put your mind to it. And don’t forget to laugh at yourself sometimes.]]></summary>

If you’re like me, you love using Tailscale to create a secure and private network for your devices. But sometimes, you need to let the outside world access your web server, whether it’s for testing, hosting, or collaborating.
That’s why I’m super excited about Tailscale Funnel, a new feature that lets you route traffic from the internet to your Tailscale node. You can think of it as publicly sharing a node for anyone to access, even if they don’t have Tailscale themselves.
Tailscale Funnel is easy to set up and use. You just need to enable it in the admin console and on your node, and you’ll get a public DNS name for your node that points to Tailscale’s Funnel servers. These servers will proxy the incoming requests over Tailscale to your node, where you can terminate the TLS and serve your content.
The best part is that Tailscale Funnel is secure and private. The Funnel servers don’t see any information about your traffic or what you’re serving. They only see the source IP and port, the SNI name, and the number of bytes passing through. And they can’t connect to your nodes directly. They only offer a TCP connection, which your nodes can accept or reject.
Tailscale Funnel is currently in beta and available for all users. I’ve been using it for a while now and I’m blown away by how simple and powerful it is. It’s like having your own personal cloud service without any hassle or cost.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-03-28T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Rust team has published a new point release of Rust, 1.68.2. Rust is a
programming language that is empowering everyone to build reliable and
efficient software.
If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, you can get 1.68.2 with:
rustup update stable

If you don't have it already, you can get rustup
from the appropriate page on our website, and check out the
detailed release notes for 1.68.2 on GitHub.
What's in 1.68.2 stable
Rust 1.68.2 addresses GitHub's recent rotation of their RSA SSH host
key, which
happened on March 24th 2023 after their previous key accidentally leaked:
GitHub's RSA key bundled in Cargo has been
updated, to ensure systems
that haven't interacted with GitHub yet won't connect trusting the leaked
key.
The leaked key has been hardcoded as revoked in
Cargo, to ensure the key
won't be used by Cargo even on systems that still trust the key.
Support for @revoked entries in
.ssh/known_hosts (along with
a better error message when the unsupported @cert-authority entries are used)
is also included in Rust 1.68.2, as that change was a pre-requisite for
backporting the hardcoded revocation.
If you cannot upgrade to Rust 1.68.2, we recommend following GitHub's
instructions
on updating the trusted keys in your system. Note that the keys bundled in
Cargo are only used if no trusted key for github.com is found on the system.
Contributors to 1.68.2
Many people came together to create Rust 1.68.2. We couldn't have done it
without all of you. Thanks!]]></summary>

Several of the giants are already on their second rounds, and few would probably bet against a third after those. But as hard as it is on an individual level – and it's always hard! – there's a silver lining for the economy as a whole: Releasing captive talent.
See, the big tech companies gobbled up so much talent at such high salaries during the pandemic that it scarcely left any for the rest of the economy. So many companies outside of big tech were priced out of the competition for key tech hires. That just can't be good for the economy in the long run. We need smart people focused on other problems beyond figuring out how to make people click more ads.

to also have thread spawning capability. This article will demonstrate a
simple, practical, and robust approach to spawning and managing threads
using only raw system calls. It only takes about a dozen lines of C,
including a few inline assembly instructions.
The catch is that there’s no way to avoid using a bit of assembly. Neither
the clone nor clone3 system calls have threading semantics compatible
with C, so you’ll need to paper over it with a bit of inline assembly per

What's in 1.68.1 stable
Rust 1.68.1 stable primarily contains a change to how Rust's CI builds the
Windows MSVC compiler, no longer enabling LTO for the Rust code. This led to a
miscompilation that the Rust
team is debugging, but in the meantime we're reverting the change to enable
LTO.
This is currently believed to have no effect on wider usage of ThinLTO. The
Rust compiler used an unstable flag as part of the build process to enable
ThinLTO despite compiling to a dylib.
There are a few other regression fixes included in the release:
Fix building the compiler with --enable-local-rust
Treat $prefix-clang as clang in linker detection code
Fix a panic in the compiler

Many people came together to create Rust 1.68.1. We couldn't have done it

        <updated>2023-03-22T10:11:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The majority of customers will never tell you why they stop buying on their own. In fact, even if pressed, most will just smile, nod, and give you some face-saving reason for how “now is just not the right time” or “we are just going in a different direction”. Because that’s what avoids conflict.


Thus, the only time you’re truly allowed a free peek at the naked truth of why your product or service didn’t fit, is when the customer is really upset. That’s when they might air out their frustration.


This is a test. 


You can either protect your ego from the sharp words of a frustrated customer by dismissing the feedback entirely OR you can be smart enough to filter out the emotion while retaining the crucial information that’ll improve your offering. Every loud, angry customer represents at least a dozen silent ones you lost to the same issues.


But it’s hard! We bond with our creations and our companies because that’s the human thing to do if you like your work. So those sharp words can and often do hurt your feelings. It’s only natural to want to parry and riposte.  


Before you do, though, remember the coin. If the customer takes the side that says “this is the end of the world”, you have to train yourself not to instinctively reach for “it’s no big deal / you’re overreacting / everyone else is fine with it”. If you do, you’ll gain nothing, and you’ll learn nothing.


So embrace the conflict of an angry customer as a rare gift of feedback. Remove your ego from the response. Extract the maximum amount of information to feed back into the offering.


That’s how you win. By building better rather than defending worse.]]></summary>

The person making the pitch has presumably put a lot of time, thought, and energy into gathering their thoughts and presenting them clearly to an audience.

They were smart, funny... and entirely out of sync with our budget. So we ended up letting them go, hiring a new head of marketing, and doing it all ourselves.
The problem was that our entire marketing budget for 2023 amounted to a "mere" five million dollars. That's a huge multiple of everything we've ever spent before on marketing in the entire 24-year history of the company, but a pittance when you work with a top-tier agency full of people who used to do campaigns for the like of Apple or Nike.
Of course this is all on us. While the agency knew what our budget was going in, we should have known that working with people who'd done work with the biggest, richest corporations in the worl…]]></summary>
