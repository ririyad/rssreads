        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The recent and rapid advance of AI has rightfully giving many in software real doubts about the future of their profession. I'd probably still wager that the fears are overstated – that we also got prematurely euphoric about the imminent prospects of self-driving cars – and that AI generating code is different from it evolving existing systems. But I wouldn't want to bet the house on it. This might just be The Big One.
That uncertainty, whether we truly are on the cusp of a total transformation, is a surprising novelty to me, despite thirty years in software. We've been through so many breathless predictions about how this or that advancement in software would simply "Change. Everything. Forever." that a certain pessimism would be perfectly reasonable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday I was speaking to a university class and, as it usually does, a question about innovation came up.


"How do you stay innovative? How do you encourage innovative thinking at work?"


My answer: You don't stay innovative and you don't encourage innovative thinking at work.


WHAT? Yes.


Innovation should almost never happen. It's incredibly rare. It mostly happens by accident, not by intention. It's wonderful when it does, but you merely fluctuate in and out of it, it's not steady state.


Work is mostly mundane. It's mostly maintenance. It's mostly local improvement and iteration. Work is mostly... Work. Any innovation is an outlier, nearly a rounding error.


Even the most innovative projects or products are full of rote, prosaic stuff that still needs building. The poetic magic may be in the 5%, but the bulk of the work is in the other 95.


So I told the students they'd better get used to that. Work is not often very exciting, but it can absolutely be fulfilling. And you can be excited about that. But if you're expecting breakthroughs all the time, riff sessions that constantly lead somewhere new, or brainstorms that shoot lightning, you're going to be disappointed.


Yes innovation happens. Occasionally. Being happy at work is about finding challenge, reward, growth, and creative and intellectual stimulation in everything else.


Now... back to this new product we're building.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our 2023 marketing campaign for Basecamp kicked off on a ton of different channels at once. Web ads, search ads, podcast ads, and TV ads all blasted the message of JUST LET ME DO MY JOB. Our flagship commercial was a hit with the audience and the critics. But our attempt at out-of-home advertising, with billboards all over Boston, was a bust at a $300,000 cost.


    
      
        

    
      
        

    
      
        

  

That's advertisement! It's hard to know what's going to work unless you give it a go. And since we're fighting competitors with one hand behind our back by refusing to use privacy-invasive ads targeted on personal data, we thought it was worth trying some more conventional channels, like billboards. But at least for software like Basecamp, it's clear that isn't likely to work.
It's not that it did nothing. We did have 98 billboards all over Boston for about a month. But the effect was only barely measurable:
  
      
        

  
As you can see, we were at the top end of the predicted normal range, or even slightly above. But even with that, we ended up spending thousands of dollars on every attributable trial signup. Way outside the realm of anything we could claim a return on, even if you factored in a fair bit of long-run brand awareness.
I will say that it felt pretty cool to see the irreverent Basecamp marketing messages appear on building-hugging billboards. There was an emotionally gratifying return on the investment. And perhaps that explains why it used to be common to see business software advertised in places like San Francisco where a lot of executives of such companies could feel good about seeing them. There's something gratifying about being in the real world like this.
But yeah, it didn't work. We won't be doing that again. But we'll always have the pictures 😄]]></summary>

Scott has been very active in the past year, working on various parts of Cargo, namely implementing workspace inheritance. Since then, he has been helping with maintenance and designing new features.
With their help we now have capacity to start thinking about how feature development should be done moving forward. We are still in early discussions of processes for matching feature development with reviewer capacity, and will share more in the future.

     deliberate Slack, as it allows their delivery to be more predictable and
     gives them time to improve their environment.
While writing that bliki post, I also defined two styles of task
     planning in agile projects. Timeboxed Iterations are used to
     break up work into small chunks with a regular cadence to reassess the work
     and future plans. Using a little ceremony around allocating work to
     iterations helps make problems visible so that they can be dealt with
     properly. Continuous Flow

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week I was talking with another business owner from a different industry. He was frustrated with an employee who kept asking him what to do if x, y, or z happens. This was a long-time employee who'd been in these situations before, not someone new who was learning the ropes.
With this particular employee, it's always the same set of questions no matter the situation. It could be a call with a client. If could be a meeting with another department. It could be a conversation with a vendor. What if they bring this up...? What if they bring that up...? What should I say if they say...? What about if they...? Essentially this employee wanted to be prepared for every contingency in a given situation. And they were great when everything went as anticipated.
Being prepared sounds like a good …]]></summary>

        <link href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/03/28/Rust-1.68.2.html"/>
        <updated>2023-03-28T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Rust team has published a new point release of Rust, 1.68.2. Rust is a
programming language that is empowering everyone to build reliable and
efficient software.
If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, you can get 1.68.2 with:
rustup update stable

If you don't have it already, you can get rustup
from the appropriate page on our website, and check out the
detailed release notes for 1.68.2 on GitHub.
What's in 1.68.2 stable
Rust 1.68.2 addresses GitHub's recent rotation of their RSA SSH host
key, which
happened on March 24th 2023 after their previous key accidentally leaked:
GitHub's RSA key bundled in Cargo has been
updated, to ensure systems
that haven't interacted with GitHub yet won't connect trusting the leaked
key.
The leaked key has been hardcoded as revoked in
Cargo, to ensure the key
won't be used by Cargo even on systems that still trust the key.
Support for @revoked entries in
.ssh/known_hosts (along with
a better error message when the unsupported @cert-authority entries are used)
is also included in Rust 1.68.2, as that change was a pre-requisite for
backporting the hardcoded revocation.
If you cannot upgrade to Rust 1.68.2, we recommend following GitHub's
instructions
on updating the trusted keys in your system. Note that the keys bundled in
Cargo are only used if no trusted key for github.com is found on the system.
Contributors to 1.68.2
Many people came together to create Rust 1.68.2. We couldn't have done it
without all of you. Thanks!]]></summary>

Several of the giants are already on their second rounds, and few would probably bet against a third after those. But as hard as it is on an individual level – and it's always hard! – there's a silver lining for the economy as a whole: Releasing captive talent.
See, the big tech companies gobbled up so much talent at such high salaries during the pandemic that it scarcely left any for the rest of the economy. So many companies outside of big tech were priced out of the competition for key tech hires. That just can't be good for the economy in the long run. We need smart people focused on other problems beyond figuring out how to make people click more ads.

What's in 1.68.1 stable
Rust 1.68.1 stable primarily contains a change to how Rust's CI builds the
Windows MSVC compiler, no longer enabling LTO for the Rust code. This led to a
miscompilation that the Rust
team is debugging, but in the meantime we're reverting the change to enable
LTO.
This is currently believed to have no effect on wider usage of ThinLTO. The
Rust compiler used an unstable flag as part of the build process to enable
ThinLTO despite compiling to a dylib.
There are a few other regression fixes included in the release:
Fix building the compiler with --enable-local-rust
Treat $prefix-clang as clang in linker detection code
Fix a panic in the compiler

        <updated>2023-03-22T10:11:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The majority of customers will never tell you why they stop buying on their own. In fact, even if pressed, most will just smile, nod, and give you some face-saving reason for how “now is just not the right time” or “we are just going in a different direction”. Because that’s what avoids conflict.


Thus, the only time you’re truly allowed a free peek at the naked truth of why your product or service didn’t fit, is when the customer is really upset. That’s when they might air out their frustration.


This is a test. 


You can either protect your ego from the sharp words of a frustrated customer by dismissing the feedback entirely OR you can be smart enough to filter out the emotion while retaining the crucial information that’ll improve your offering. Every loud, angry customer represents at least a dozen silent ones you lost to the same issues.


But it’s hard! We bond with our creations and our companies because that’s the human thing to do if you like your work. So those sharp words can and often do hurt your feelings. It’s only natural to want to parry and riposte.  


Before you do, though, remember the coin. If the customer takes the side that says “this is the end of the world”, you have to train yourself not to instinctively reach for “it’s no big deal / you’re overreacting / everyone else is fine with it”. If you do, you’ll gain nothing, and you’ll learn nothing.


So embrace the conflict of an angry customer as a rare gift of feedback. Remove your ego from the response. Extract the maximum amount of information to feed back into the offering.


That’s how you win. By building better rather than defending worse.]]></summary>

The person making the pitch has presumably put a lot of time, thought, and energy into gathering their thoughts and presenting them clearly to an audience. But the rest of the people in the room are asked to react. Not absorb, not think it over, not consider — just react. Knee-jerk it. That's no way to treat fragile, new ideas.
