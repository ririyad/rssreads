I've never had the race go that long before getting into the car. Usually by midnight, I'll have driven at least a good two hours of the required minimum six. But this edition of Le Mans also had more drama than any of the previous nine attempts I've been part of. At the end of the race, 22 cars had retired from crashes or mechanical issues, and several more were limping home many laps down. It was mayhem.
Which started right from the words green, green, green. By the first chicane down the Mulsanne straight, a Cadillac in the class above us crashed hard immediately in front of …]]></summary>

As with every complex subject, people – me included – love to reduce it to a dichotomy. A binary choice where you can either be right or wrong. I'm in the camp of remote-work-is-the-best, but I can't deny that many folks and companies thrive with on-site work. Plenty of evidence backing up any side you want to take here.


What always surprises me is that most assume that existing companies have a choice. Generally speaking, I don't think they do. If a company obtaining good results isn't working remotely already, it will likely fail to switch…]]></summary>

Here’s the 15th installment of my popular Heard Something, Read Something, Saw Something series.
So, what do we have this time...
Heard Something
These 11 minutes will restore your faith in humanity. A student pilot loses her front nose gear on takeoff on her 3rd solo flight ever. An incredible amount of support comes in over the radio from the tower and fellow pilots, helping her keep her calm and eventually land safely. Heartwarming all around. Just listen.
Hear it: https://youtu.be/USW53vdL_0c
Read Something
Here’s a great piece on paying it backward. From music to sports to movies, Matt shares some great examples of younger, “hotter” talents shining a light on someone they’d long respected to help elevate them in the public consciousness.
Read it: https://mattruby.substack.com/p/pay-it-backward-?r=7wjyf
Saw Something
“Whoever came up with this superb bit of creativity at Target, I salute you.” You kinda wonder if it was put up this way, or if a customer did the deed. Regardless, clever!
See it: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6951158945868599296/?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web

If advice on how to run your company isn't coming at you 280 characters at a time on Twitter, you can hear it on a podcast, read it on a Substack, or get it right here on your LinkedIn feed. There's hardly a CEO, an entrepreneur, or a cultural figure these days who doesn't profess to hold some wisdom that will lead you to building a great business.
I don't think this proliferation of expertise is a particularly useful development. It's overwhelming and often contradicting. It's hard to know what's worth knowing when you don't know in the first place.

This experiment convinced millions of employees of how much better life could be without a commute or even having to live by the office, but also left uneasy the legions of managers whose skills and mindsets were anchored in the office.
This reversal plot is know as hybrid work, and combines the worst of in-office and remote work worlds. The shrewd – but likely temporary – concession here is starting with three days in the office, two from home.

We're staring at two distinctly different visions of the future. They may co-exist, but they are radically different takes on what's modern, what's current, and where things are headed.
One vision gets the UI out of the way. The other vision is UI everywhere you look.
One vision gets the computer out of the way. The other vision mounts a computer on your face.
One vision is get it and go. One vision is get it and stay.
One vision fades into the background. The other vision is front and center.
One vision is about information. The other vision is about immersion.
One vision is natural and understands you. The other vision requires new methods of interaction that you have to learn and master.
One vision feels like an assist. One vision feels like obstruction.
One vision fits with whatever you already have. One vision requires you buy something that fits.
One vision is simply text. One vision is anything but.
One vision feels like before. One vision feels like after. But I'm not sure which is which.
Both are extraordinary.

The first time I saw software development described as a wicked problem was in Code Complete by Steve McConnell, and I haven't seen anything but a constant validation of this proposition throughout my career. And it's a paradoxical one with several counterintuitive corollaries. Here's one: if you don't understand what you need to build, you should start building it. And here's another: sweating to build something just to hit the delete button is sometimes part of the process.

Companies spend their employees’ time and attention as if there was an infinite supply of both. As if they cost nothing. Yet employees’ time and attention are among the scarcest resources we have.
At 37signals, we see it as our top job to protect our employees’ time and attention. You can’t expect people to do great work if they don’t have a full day’s attention to devote to it. Partial attention is barely attention at all.

That was basically it, and it was glorious.

But the natural inclination is to promote senior contributors up a managerial ladder, and out of the trenches. This often ends poorly, turning the promotion into a punishment.
It's usually not that these potential managers don't like working with others. Quite the contrary. I've found that nothing motivates ambitious people like working close together with other talented individuals. It's also usually not that they're uncomfortable being senior, in terms of setting a direction for the work. It's that they don't want the responsibility, and associated guilt, that comes with managing others. Especially when there's a need for correction.

The rest of the time, across hundreds of reviews, it was an arduous, awkward affair of forcing people to come up with novel ways to congratulate each other on command. Dropping these 360s was perhaps one of the most popular acts of minimizing management we've ever done at 37signals.
It should have been obvious that the 360 process wasn't valuable because almost nobody wanted to do it. Getting folks to fill out their reviews required constant nagging, resulting in weeks-long procrastination.

At 37signals, we've been doing company-wide meetups twice a year for over fifteen years. Through these meetups, we've secured the lion's share of the social in-person benefits afforded by an office, while allowing nearly eighty people from twenty countries to collaborate happily and effectively. It's remarkable how nourishing it can be simply to see your coworkers every six months, and then rely on those ful…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you want to run a company that's light on full-time managers, you have to focus on managing processes before people. The traditional paradigm of a reporting manager that's constantly following up with their reports, conducting daily stand-up meetings, weekly 1-1s, and all other forms of intensive supervision, needs to be (mostly) replaced with an asynchronous, self-managing paradigm instead.
Let's look at five ways that principle works in practice at 37signals. 
First, we've replaced the commonly used daily stand-up meetings with a set of automated questions in Basecamp. On Monday mornings, we ask everyone "What are you going to work on this week?", and at the end of every day, we ask "What did you work on today?". These two recurring questions provide the key process for keeping everyo…]]></summary>

That's not to say that we never run these numbers, but it is to say that these numbers never run us. Because in the end, even the most sophisticated KPIs all inevitably serve the simplest calculations: Are we making money? Is it enough? You don't need a degree in statistics to determine that.

Then, that masks – any masks! – would materially retard the spread. Later, that the vaccine would prevent you from getting the virus. Finally, that if you were vaccinated, you couldn't spread the virus. All of that, and plenty more, turned out to be false.
In the years to come, there'll be plenty of time to point fingers. Who, when, where. The main characters are already digging their rhetorical tunnels. 
But as we've passed the three-year anniversary for pandemic, I think it's just as important to look inwards. Because not only did most people buy the false claims, they became little foot soldiers in the crusade for them. Including me, for a while.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I found that xref in Emacs had stopped working for me on my mac laptop. Today I finally tried to figure out what went wrong. xref is just a front-end, all the work is done by backends. It took a while for me to realize (ie remember) that I was using the excellent dumb-jump package as the backend. dumb-jump uses a range of fast search commands (such as ag and ripgrep) to detect references without using the awkward tags tables that Emacs used to rely on.
The command flow between xref and dumb-jump is difficult to follow, but looking at the dumb-jump customization page alerted me to dumb-jump having a debug option. With this enabled, I could see what command dumb-jump was sending to the operating system. By default it uses git grep while in a git repo (almost everything I do is in a git repo). Its git grep command is quite complex, using regexps to (I assume) get more sensible results. I tried out the command it issued in my own terminal and it failed to find anything, while a simple git grep worked fine.
Armed with a better knowledge of what was failing, I dug into dumb-jump’s issues and found Issue with git-grep. Reading that, I discovered that a change to git grep means that how git grep processes regexes differs depending on the operating system. This would mean that dumb-jump would need to detect git-grep’s version and the underlying OS to pick the right regexes for its search.
The fix for me is to force dumb-jump to use another searcher with (setq dumb-jump-force-searcher 'rg). With that my xref commands worked again.]]></summary>

If you are an experienced software developer whose only exposure to
reddit is dank memes, proggit or even
language-specific subreddits like
/r/python, you're missing out.
What follows are my favorite subreddits in tech. My criteria is that:
The subreddit topic is relevant to advancing as a programmer
Posts generally go into good depth
The comments stay on topic
And the shit-posting is minimal
This list isn't hard to guess at if you consider advanced topics
in software. But I wanted to share because I think it's worth
explicitly supporting high-quality subreddits.
/r/EmuDev
My favorite sub of all. Also has a phenomenal Discord group.
/r/ProgrammingLanguages
Focuses a little more on PLT topics (parsing techniques, syntax, type systems) than on compiling and interpreting techniques, but still good.
/r/DatabaseDevelopment
All about database internals, which ends up involving a bunch of
correctness and distributed systems stuff as well.
Disclosure: I run this sub. It's at 2.7k+ members at time of publishing.
/r/ReverseEngineering
The largest subreddit on this list but still has pretty good posts.
/r/EsoLangs
One of the best/most fun intros to programming languages/compilers/interpreters is through languages like Brainfuck. This sub does a good job of keeping the fun going.
/r/Compilers
/r/GraphicsProgramming
While some language subreddits are pretty good, they are more so a
mixed bag than some of the topic-specific subreddits here. So they
don't make my list, more on principle than anything else.
If there is a good one already, send me it!
What am I missing?
Am I missing other amazing subreddits? Just don't say
language-specific ones. :)

It's an incorrect meme IMO that tech Reddit is low-quality. You just have to find the interesting subreddits.

You don't need to read books to improve as a developer but

High Performance Browser Networking

It is a thorough high level introduction to mobile networks, browser
network protocols, and fundementals of networking.
Designing Data-Intensive Applications
If you use a database (including an in-memory array of items you

from this book. A solid introduction to distributed computing, data
transfer, indexing, etc.
That's it!
Generic software books conspicuously not on this list for

A Philosophy of Software Design
