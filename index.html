                              <span>Airbnb has acquired a secretive new AI startup, GamePlanner.AI, for around $200 million. TechCrunch reports: GamePlanner was co-founded by Adam Cheyer and Siamak Hodjat. Cheyer famously helped co-launch the startup Siri, which Apple acquired and whose technology became the basis for Apple&#x27;s AI-powered Siri assistant. Hodjat previously worked with Cheyer at Viv Labs, a firm that Samsung bought and leveraged to launch its own AI assistant, Bixby, in 2017. It&#x27;s not immediately clear what GamePlanner does. A LinkedIn search only turns up two associates: Gabe Greenbaum, a general partner at B Capital who sits on GamePlanner&#x27;s board of directors, and Joseph Huang, head of design at GamePlanner. GamePlanner hasn&#x27;t had a web presence for some time; the Internet Archive&#x27;s earliest cache of the website (from December 2021) yields a blank page.
 
But in a canned statement, Airbnb CEO and co-founder Brian Chesky hinted that the 12-person startup combines expertise in AI and design toward crafting AI-driven experiences, sort of like an AI-focused consultancy. &quot;AI will rapidly alter our world more than any other technology in our lifetime, but we need to ensure that it augments humanity in a positive way,&quot; Chesky said, adding that the GamePlanner team will focus on &quot;accelerating&quot; select AI projects and integrating their tooling into Airbnb&#x27;s platform. &quot;Airbnb is one of the more humanistic companies in technology, and I believe that, together with Adam and his team, we can develop some of the best interfaces and practical applications for AI.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Engadget: A group of lawmakers from a House of Representatives committee wants Apple, like many Jon Stewart enthusiasts, to explain why its streaming arm abruptly canceled the talk show The Problem With Jon Stewart. The current affairs TV series hosted by Jon Stewart briefly made its debut on Apple TV+ in 2021 but its time on air ended when the show received the ax for a third season, reportedly due to &quot;disagreements&quot; over show topics.
 
According to Reuters, Lawmakers want to know if the show&#x27;s coverage and criticism of China has anything to do with the show&#x27;s cancellation. The government officials have asked Apple to speak on the issue by Dec 15, 2023. In a letter to the tech giant, the House members wrote that while Apple has the right to determine what content it deems appropriate for its platform, &quot;the coercive tactics of a foreign power should not be directly or indirectly influencing these determinations.&quot; This effort is bipartisan, with members from both Republican and Democratic parties affiliated with the House of Representatives&#x27; Select Committee on Competition with the Chinese Communist Party.

                              <span>Michael Larabel reports via Phoronix: Guardrails have been in place where the Firefox browser has enabled Wayland by default (when running on recent GTK versions) but as of today that code has been removed... Firefox will try to move forward with stable releases where Wayland will ship by default! Mozilla Bug 1752398 to &quot;ship the Wayland backend to release&quot; has been closed this evening! After the ticket was open for the past two years, it&#x27;s now deemed ready to hopefully ship enabled for Firefox 121!
 
This patch drops the &quot;early beta or earlier&quot; check to let Wayland support be enabled by default when running on recent GTK versions (GTK 3.24.30 threshold). Firefox 121 is due for release around 19 December and if all continues to hold, it will finally ship with the Wayland back-end enabled by default as another big step forward.

                              <span>In what may be a potentially confusing rebranding move, Microsoft today has rebranded Bing Chat to Copilot, sharing the same brand name as multiple other Microsoft AI products. Search Engine Land reports: Bing is no longer &quot;your AI-powered copilot for the web.&quot; However, Microsoft Bing will still provide a combined Search and chat experience. It will just be called CoPilot heading forward. For people who may not want that combined experience, CoPilot will have its own standalone ChatGPT-style experience at https://copilot.microsoft.com/.
 
Microsoft said the rebrand is to unify the Copilot experience: &quot;Our efforts to simplify the user experience and make Copilot more accessible to everyone starts with Bing, our leading experience for the web. Beginning today, Bing Chat and Bing Chat Enterprise are becoming Copilot, with commercial data protection enforced when any eligible user is signed in with Microsoft Entra ID.&quot;
 
While it&#x27;s definitely a more unified experience, it also seems a bit confusing because Microsoft&#x27;s chatbot &quot;companion&quot; is used across multiple apps, including Microsoft 365, Edge, Windows and more -- some free, some not. In addition to Bing Chat, Bing Chat Enterprise is also rebranded as Copilot Pro. It offers the same chat functionality with greater commercial data protection for Microsoft 365 subscribers.

Qi2 sports a &quot;Magnetic Power Profile&quot; (MPP), created with help by Apple&#x27;s MagSafe team, to help align devices and chargers&#x27; coils for faster, more efficient charging. Qi2-certified devices set onto Qi2 chargers can achieve 15 W charging, up from 7.5 W in the standard Qi scheme.
 
That brings Qi2 devices up to the same speed as iPhones on MagSafe chargers, and it clears up some consumer confusion about how fast a device might charge on Qi, MagSafe, or proprietary charger…</span>

                              <span>Nasa&#x27;s James Webb space telescope has revealed a planet where specks of sand fall as rain, in groundbreaking observations. From a report: The planet, Wasp-107b, lies 200 light years away in the Virgo constellation and had already caught the attention of astronomers because it is very large but very light, earning it the nickname the &quot;candy floss&quot; planet. The latest observations give an unprecedented glimpse of a strange and exotic world beyond our solar system that features silicate sand clouds and rain, scorching temperatures, raging winds and the distinct burnt-matches scent of sulphur dioxide. &quot;Our knowledge of other planets is based on what we know from Earth,&quot; said Prof Leen Decin, of the Catholic Institute (KU) Leuven and first author of the research. &quot;That&#x27;s a very restricted knowledge.&quot; 

The planet was discovered in 2017 after astronomers spotted a telltale periodic flickering of light from its host star each time the planet passed in front of it. &quot;It&#x27;s like a fly in front of a street lamp,&quot; said Decin. &quot;You see a slight dimming of the light.&quot; James Webb takes these observations to the next level by measuring starlight that is filtered through the planet&#x27;s atmosphere. Because different elements absorb different wavelengths of light, the spectrum of starlight indicates which gases are present. Wasp-107b is similar in mass to Neptune but almost the size of Jupiter, and its vast, diffuse nature allows the James Webb telescope to peer deep into its atmosphere.

                              <span>Amazon said on Wednesday that it was removing seven eyedrops products from its website after the Food and Drug Administration warned the company that the eyedrops had not been recognized as safe and effective. From a report: The F.D.A. said in a letter to Andrew Jassy, Amazon&#x27;s chief executive, on Monday that Amazon had violated federal regulations by selling the eyedrops, which claimed to help with problems including pink eye, dry eyes, eyestrain and floaters. &quot;These products are especially concerning from a public health perspective,&quot; the F.D.A. letter said. &quot;Ophthalmic drug products, which are intended for administration into the eyes, in general pose a greater risk of harm to users because the route of administration for these products bypasses some of the body&#x27;s natural defenses.&quot; 

The eyedrops named in the letter are: Similasan Pink Eye Relief, The Goodbye Company Pink Eye, Can-C Eye Drops, Optique 1 Eye Drops, OcluMed Eye Drops, TRP Natural Eyes Floaters Relief, and Manzanilla Sophia Chamomile Herbal Eye Drops. None of the eyedrops appeared to be available for purchase on Amazon on Wednesday morning. The company said in an emailed statement on Wednesday that &quot;safety is a top priority.&quot;

                              <span>Microsoft and Nvidia want to help developers run and configure AI models on their Windows PCs. During the Microsoft Ignite event on Wednesday, Microsoft announced Windows AI Studio: a new hub where developers can access AI models and tweak them to suit their needs. From a report: Windows AI Studio allows developers to access development tools and models from the existing Azure AI Studio and other services like Hugging Face. It also offers an end-to-end &quot;guided workspace setup&quot; with model configuration UI and walkthroughs to fine-tune various small language models (SLMs), such as Microsoft&#x27;s Phi, Meta&#x27;s Llama 2, and Mistral. 

Windows AI Studio lets developers test the performance of their models using Prompt Flow and Gradio templates as well. Microsoft says it&#x27;s going to roll out Windows AI Studio as a Visual Studio Code extension in the &quot;coming weeks.&quot; Nvidia, similarly, revealed updates to TensorRT-LLM, which the company initially launched for Windows as a way to run large language models (LLMs) more efficiently on H100 GPUs. However, this latest update brings TensorRT-LLM to PCs powered by GeForce RTX 30 and 40 Series GPUs with 8GB of RAM or more.

                              <span>Tencent dismissed concerns that US export controls will constrain its AI development capabilities, at least for the foreseeable future. From a report: The Shenzhen-based company has stockpiled Nvidia&#x27;s H800 artificial intelligence accelerators, enough to develop its proprietary Hunyuan AI model for at least another couple of generations, President Martin Lau said on an analyst call after earnings on Wednesday. &quot;Right now we actually have one of the largest inventories of AI chips in China among all the players,&quot; Lau said. &quot;We were the first to put in orders for H800 and that allows us to have a pretty good inventory of H800 chips. So we have enough chips to continue our development.&quot; 

The Biden administration in October escalated export controls on AI semiconductors heading to China, depriving the Asian nation from access to a broad range of the world&#x27;s best AI-training hardware. The purpose of the measures is to prevent China&#x27;s military from obtaining the advanced technology, Washington argues, but they&#x27;re also making business harder for the country&#x27;s private sector. Elsewhere in China, AI industry veteran Kai-Fu Lee&#x27;s unicorn startup 01.AI has been buying up the Nvidia chips it needs to develop its own foundation models, with Lee saying the company has enough semiconductors for the next 18 months.

If you&#x27;re familiar with Notion&#x27;s interface at all, Loop looks and feels remarkably similar -- right down to the ability to easily access a bunch of tools and formatting options by typing the forward slash key (which pulls up what Microsoft calls the &quot;insert menu&quot;). But because Loop is built by Microsoft, that means it has some useful integrations with other Microsoft software.

                              <span>The EU has struck a deal that will force the fossil fuel industry to rein in dangerous methane pollution. From a report: Under the proposed law, which is the first of its kind, coal, oil and gas companies would be required to report their methane emissions and take steps to avoid them. The measures include finding and fixing leaks, and limiting wasteful practices such as venting and flaring gas by 2027. Jutta Paulus, a German MEP with the Green grouping who worked on the proposal, said: &quot;Finally, the EU tackles the second most important greenhouse gas with ambitious measures. Less methane emissions mean more climate protection and more energy sovereignty.&quot; 

Methane has more than 80 times the global heating power of carbon dioxide over a 20-year timespan but does not last as long in the atmosphere. Cutting methane emissions is seen as a cheap and easy way to stop extreme weather growing more violent in the short-term. The new EU rules, which were agreed on Wednesday by the European parliament and European Council, mean fossil fuel companies must try to repair leaks no more than five days after finding them, and fully fix them within a month. By the end of next year, operators will have to survey their existing sites and submit action plans to find and fix methane leaks.

                              <span>Microsoft unveiled its first homegrown AI chip and cloud-computing processor in an attempt to take more control of its technology and ramp up its offerings in the increasingly competitive market for AI computing. The company also announced new software that lets clients design their own AI assistants. From a report: The Maia 100 chip, announced at the company&#x27;s annual Ignite conference in Seattle on Wednesday, will provide Microsoft Azure cloud customers with a new way run AI programs that generate content. Microsoft is already testing the chip with its Bing and Office AI products, said Rani Borkar, a vice president who oversees Azure&#x27;s chip unit. Microsoft&#x27;s main AI partner, ChatGPT maker OpenAI, is also testing the processor. Both Maia and the server chip, Cobalt, will debut in some Microsoft data centers early next year. 

Microsoft&#x27;s multi-year investment shows how critical chips have become to gaining an edge in both AI and the cloud. Making them in-house lets companies wring performance and price benefits from the hardware. The initiative also could insulate Microsoft from becoming overly dependent on any one supplier, a vulnerability currently underscored by the industrywide scramble for Nvidia&#x27;s AI chips. Microsoft&#x27;s push into processors follows similar moves by cloud rivals. Amazon.com Inc. acquired a chip maker in 2015 and sells services built on several kinds of cloud and AI chips. Google began letting customers use its AI accelerator processors in 2018.

                              <span>Ever wanted to add your own annotations to search results you find on Google? With Google&#x27;s new &quot;Notes&quot; experiment, launching Wednesday as an opt-in feature through Search Labs, you&#x27;ll be able to. From a report: If you&#x27;ve opted in to Notes, buttons to add and see notes will appear under search results and under articles on Discover in the Google app. When you create a note, you can add colorful fonts and images. During a briefing, Google showed me a note for an article about different kinds of frosting that had green text, an image of a cake, and a heart sticker. (At the bottom of the note, there was a link to the article the note was about.) 

If you post a note, it should show up &quot;within minutes,&quot; unless it&#x27;s flagged for human review, Google VP Cathy Edwards said in an interview with The Verge. When you look at all of the notes for a link, what&#x27;s shown will be ranked dynamically based on things like the user&#x27;s query and a note&#x27;s relevance to the content on the page.

                              <span>Huawei and China Mobile have built a 3,000 kilometer (1,860-mile) internet network linking Beijing to the south, which the country is touting as its latest technological breakthrough. From a report: The two firms teamed up with Tsinghua University and research provider Cernet.com to build what they claim is the world&#x27;s first internet network to achieve a &quot;stable and reliable&quot; bandwidth of 1.2 terabits per second, several times faster than typical speeds around the world. Trials began July 31 and it&#x27;s since passed various tests verifying that milestone, the university said in a statement. 

Tsinghua, Chinese President Xi Jinping&#x27;s alma mater, is plugging the project as an industry-first built entirely on homegrown technology, and credits Huawei prominently in its statement. The Chinese firm in August made waves when it released a 5G smartphone with a sophisticated made-in-China processor, inspiring celebration in Chinese state and social media. That event also spurred debate in Washington about whether the Biden administration has gone far enough in attempts to contain Chinese technological achievement.

                              <span>Fitbit is active in only 23 countries after leaving Mexico, South Africa, and all Latin American countries. &quot;We communicated that we will stop selling Fitbit products in select countries in order to align our hardware portfolio to map closer to Pixel&#x27;s regional availability,&quot; a Google spokesperson confirmed to Cord Cutters News via email. From the report: The move marks a phasing out of Fitbit products after the Big Tech company acquired wearable company in 2021. Last month, Fitbit said it would remove itself from Asian markets Hong Kong, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines, along with European markets Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Romania, and Slovakia. It&#x27;s possible Google is removing Fitbit and Nest from the European markets because they don&#x27;t have a Google Store support. If that changes, Fitbit products and Nest Aware subscriptions could return. New products like the Pixel Watch could also arrive for the first time. &quot;We remain committed to our customers and have not made any changes that impact the existing Fitbit devices they already own. Existing Fitbit customers will continue to have access to the same customer support, warranties will still be honored, and products will continue to receive software and security updates,&quot; the Google spokesperson said.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Intel on Tuesday pushed microcode updates to fix a high-severity CPU bug that has the potential to be maliciously exploited against cloud-based hosts. The flaw, affecting virtually all modern Intel CPUs, causes them to &quot;enter a glitch state where the normal rules don&#x27;t apply,&quot; Tavis Ormandy, one of several security researchers inside Google who discovered the bug, reported. Once triggered, the glitch state results in unexpected and potentially serious behavior, most notably system crashes that occur even when untrusted code is executed within a guest account of a virtual machine, which, under most cloud security models, is assumed to be safe from such faults. Escalation of privileges is also a possibility.

                              <span>A few months ago, by accepting RFC 3355, the decision was made to start working on an official specification for the Rust language. Eric (maintainer of the Rust Reference), Felix (Rust language team), Joel (Rust Foundation) and Mara (author of the RFC) have been working together to get this effort started.
With this blog post, we present the steps we have taken so far and our plans for approaching the rest of this big task.
Editor
One of the first steps was to fill the role of &quot;editor&quot; as laid out in the RFC. The responsibility of coordination and editing of the specification is purposely delegated to the Rust Foundation, to ensure continuity of the work.
As part of the hiring effort for this role by the Foundation, we interviewed a few interested candidates with relevant experience. Becau…</span>

                              <span>Sarah Perez reports via TechCrunch: YouTube today announced how it will approach handling AI-created content on its platform with a range of new policies surrounding responsible disclosure as well as new tools for requesting the removal of deepfakes, among other things. The company says that, although it already has policies that prohibit manipulated media, AI necessitated the creation of new policies because of its potential to mislead viewers if they don&#x27;t know the video has been &quot;altered or synthetically created.&quot; One of the changes that will roll out involves the creation of new disclosure requirements for YouTube creators. Now, they&#x27;ll have to disclose when they&#x27;ve created altered or synthetic content that appears realistic, including videos made with AI tools. For instance, this disc…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Electrek: On Monday, Rivian released an incremental software update 2023.42, which bricked the infotainment system in R1Ses and R1Ts. The company is frantically working on a fix, but it might not be an OTA. [...] The vehicles are drivable, but software and displays go black. It appears that the 2023.42 software update hangs at 90% on the vehicle screen or 50% on the app screen, and then the vehicle screens black out. All systems appear to still work except for the displays. At the moment, it appears that Amazon vans are not impacted. Update: The company has acknowledged the issue with affected customers but has yet to issue a fix or plan to fix. Rivian&#x27;s vice president of software engineering, Wassim Bensaid, took to Reddit to update users on the situation, writing: &quot;Hi All, We made an error with the 2023.42 OTA update -- a fat finger where the wrong build with the wrong security certificates was sent out. We cancelled the campaign and we will restart it with the proper software that went through the different campaigns of beta testing. Service will be contacting impacted customers and will go through the resolution options. That may require physical repair in some cases. This is on us -- we messed up. Thanks for your support and your patience as we go through this.
 
*Update 1 (11/13, 10:45 PM PT): The issue impacts the infotainment system. In most cases, the rest of the vehicle systems are still operational. A vehicle reset or sleep cycle will not solve the issue. We are validating the best options to address the issue for the impacted vehicles. Our customer support team is prioritizing support for our customers related to this issue. Thank you.&quot;

                              <span>India&#x27;s capital, New Delhi, is preparing a new weapon in the fight against deadly air pollution: cloud seeding. From a report: The experiment, which could take place as early as next week, would introduce chemicals like silver iodide into a cloudy sky to create rain and, it&#x27;s hoped, wash away the fine particulate matter hovering over one of the world&#x27;s largest cities. The need is desperate. Delhi has already tried traffic restriction measures, multimillion-dollar air filtration towers, and the use of fleets of water-spraying trucks to dissolve the particulate matter in the air -- but to no avail. 

The use of cloud seeding, if it goes ahead, would be controversial. &quot;It&#x27;s not at all a good use of resources because it&#x27;s not a solution, it&#x27;s like a temporary relief,&quot; says Avikal Somvanshi, a …</span>

                              <span>Some of the United States&#x27; largest civil liberties groups are urging Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer not to pursue a short-term extension of the Section 702 surveillance program slated to sunset on December 31. From a report: The more than 20 groups -- Demand Progress, the Brennan Center for Justice, American Civil Liberties Union, and Asian Americans Advancing Justice among them -- oppose plans that would allow the program to continue temporarily by amending &quot;must-pass&quot; legislation, such as the bill needed now to avert a government shutdown by Friday, or the National Defense Authorization Act, annual legislation set to dictate $886 billion in national security spending across the Pentagon and US Department of Energy in 2024. 

&quot;In its current form, [Section 702] is dangerous to our liberties and our democracy, and it should not be renewed for any length of time without robust debate, an opportunity for amendment, and -- ultimately -- far-reaching reforms,&quot; a letter from the groups to Schumer says. It adds that any attempt to prolong the program by rushed amendment &quot;would demonstrate blatant disregard for the civil liberties and civil rights of the American people.&quot;

                              <span>The Top500 organization released its semi-annual list of the fastest supercomputers in the world, with the AMD-powered Frontier supercomputer retaining its spot at the top of the list with 1.194 Exaflop/s (EFlop/s) of performance, fending off a half-scale 585.34 Petaflop/s (PFlop/s) submission from the Argonne National Laboratory&#x27;s Intel-powered Aurora supercomputer. From a report: Argonne&#x27;s submission, which only employs half of the Aurora system, lands at the second spot on the Top500, unseating Japan&#x27;s Fugaku as the second-fastest supercomputer in the world. Intel also made inroads with 20 new supercomputers based on its Sapphire Rapids CPUs entering the list, but AMD&#x27;s EPYC continues to take over the Top500 as it now powers 140 systems on the list -- a 39% year-over-year increase. 

Intel and Argonne are currently still working to bring Arora fully online for users in 2024. As such, the Aurora submission represented 10,624 Intel CPUs and 31,874 Intel GPUs working in concert to deliver 585.34 PFlop/s at a total of 24.69 megawatts (MW) of energy. In contrast, AMD&#x27;s Frontier holds the performance title at 1.194 EFlop/s, which is more than twice the performance of Aurora, while consuming a comparably miserly 22.70 MW of energy (yes, that&#x27;s less power for the full Frontier supercomputer than half of the Aurora system). Aurora did not land on the Green500, a list of the most power-efficient supercomputers, with this submission, but Frontier continues to hold eighth place on that list. However, Aurora is expected to eventually reach up to 2 EFlop/s of performance when it comes fully online. When complete, Auroroa will have 21,248 Xeon Max CPUs and 63,744 Max Series &#x27;Ponte Vecchio&#x27; GPUs spread across 166 racks and 10,624 compute blades, making it the largest known single deployment of GPUs in the world. The system leverages HPE Cray EX â&quot; Intel Exascale Compute Blades and uses HPE&#x27;s Slingshot-11 networking interconnect.

                              <span>After a tech entrepreneur and investor lost his password for retrieving $100,000 in bitcoin and hired experts to break open the wallet where he kept it, they failed to help him. But in the process, they discovered a way to crack enough other software wallets to steal $1 billion or more. From a report: On Tuesday, the team is releasing information about how they did it. They hope it&#x27;s enough data that the owners of millions of wallets will realize they are at risk and move their money, but not so much data that criminals can figure out how to pull off what would be one of the largest heists of all time. 

Their start-up, Unciphered, has worked for months to alert more than a million people that their wallets are at risk. Millions more haven&#x27;t been told, often because their wallets were created at cryptocurrency websites that have gone out of business. The story of those wallets&#x27; vulnerabilities underscores the enormous risk in experimental currencies, beyond their wild fluctuations in value and fast-changing regulations. Many wallets were created with code containing profound flaws, and the companies that used that code can disappear. Beyond that, it is a sobering reminder that underneath software infrastructure of all kinds, even ones explicitly dedicated to securing funds, are open-source programs that few or no people oversee. &quot;Open-source ages like milk. It will eventually go bad,&quot; said Chris Wysopal, a co-founder of security company Veracode who advised Unciphered as it sorted through the problem.

                              <span>In research published in Science today, Google DeepMind&#x27;s model, GraphCast, was able to predict weather conditions up to 10 days in advance, more accurately and much faster than the current gold standard. From a report: GraphCast outperformed the model from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in more than 90% of over 1,300 test areas. And on predictions for Earth&#x27;s troposphere -- the lowest part of the atmosphere, where most weather happens -- GraphCast outperformed the ECMWF&#x27;s model on more than 99% of weather variables, such as rain and air temperature. Crucially, GraphCast can also offer meteorologists accurate warnings, much earlier than standard models, of conditions such as extreme temperatures and the paths of cyclones. In September, GraphCast accurately predicted that Hurricane Lee would make landfall in Nova Scotia nine days in advance, says Remi Lam, a staff research scientist at Google DeepMind. Traditional weather forecasting models pinpointed the hurricane to Nova Scotia only six days in advance. 

[...] Traditionally, meteorologists use massive computer simulations to make weather predictions. They are very energy intensive and time consuming to run, because the simulations take into account many physics-based equations and different weather variables such as temperature, precipitation, pressure, wind, humidity, and cloudiness, one by one. GraphCast uses machine learning to do these calculations in under a minute. Instead of using the physics-based equations, it bases its predictions on four decades of historical weather data. GraphCast uses graph neural networks, which map Earth&#x27;s surface into more than a million grid points. At each grid point, the model predicts the temperature, wind speed and direction, and mean sea-level pressure, as well as other conditions like humidity. The neural network is then able to find patterns and draw conclusions about what will happen next for each of these data points.

                              <span>Nothing Phone 2 owners get blue bubbles now. The company shared it has added iMessage to its newest phone through a new &quot;Nothing Chats&quot; app powered by the messaging platform Sunbird. From a report: The feature will be available to users in North America, the EU, and other European countries starting this Friday, November 17th. Nothing writes on its page that it&#x27;s doing this because &quot;messaging services are dividing phone users,&quot; and it wants &quot;to break those barriers down.&quot; But doing so here requires you to trust Sunbird. Nothing&#x27;s FAQ says Sunbird&#x27;s &quot;architecture provides a system to deliver a message from one user to another without ever storing it at any point in its journey,&quot; and that messages aren&#x27;t stored on its servers. 

Marques Brownlee has also had a preview of Nothing Chats. He confirmed with Nothing that, similar to how other iMessage-to-Android bridge services have worked before, &quot;...it&#x27;s literally signing in on some Mac Mini in a server farm somewhere, and that Mac Mini will then do all of the routing for you to make this happen.&quot; Nothing&#x27;s US head of PR, Jane Nho, told The Verge in an email that Sunbird stores user iCloud credentials as a token &quot;in an encrypted database&quot; and associated with one of its Mac Minis in the US or Europe, depending on the user&#x27;s location, that then act as a relay for iMessages sent via the app. She added that, after two weeks of inactivity, Sunbird deletes the account information.

                              <span>An anonymous reader writes: Videos collected by 404 Media over months give a peek into the world of spoofing numbers, automated call scripts, and a specific seller of the phones. From the report: &quot;Alright lads,&quot; a man sitting in the passenger seat of a moving car says in a heavy British accent. In his left hand he holds a special phone he is showing off to his clients, while with the other he films his demonstration which was later uploaded to Telegram. &quot;I&#x27;m only going to say it once, yeah. You swipe, and it&#x27;s gone,&quot; he continues, demonstrating one app installed that can instantly destroy data stored on the device. The phone in question is one from &quot;Russiancoms,&quot; an underground outfit that sells the devices for just under $2,000 each. For that price, customers get a laundry list of features: the ability to spoof phone numbers, play hold music, and have a computerized voice read pre-determined scripts. While Russiancoms does not acknowledge in its Telegram channel what the phones might really be for, those are features well suited to committing fraud. 

The Russiancoms Telegram channel periodically deletes its videos and other messages, but 404 Media has been archiving many of them for months. They provide insight into a little known industry of fraud phones, ones that make it easy for anyone to enter the world of robocalling or other scams. While much of the underground phone industry has been focused on providing secure communications to criminals -- companies like Phantom Secure, Encrochat, and Sky for example -- Russiancoms and similar companies appear to cater to a different use case: enabling people to make calls that fraudulently appear to come from someone else. A common tool in the underground is also so-called Russian SIMs, which can spoof numbers in some cases. Russiancoms&#x27; phones, however, are more fully featured.

                              <span>The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has struggled to stop a hyper-aggressive cybercrime gang that&#x27;s been tormenting corporate America over the last two years, according to nine cybersecurity responders, digital crime experts and victims. Reuters: For more than six months, the FBI has known the identities of at least a dozen members tied to the hacking group responsible for the devastating September break-ins at casino operators MGM Resorts International and Caesars Entertainment, according to four people familiar with the investigation. Industry executives have told Reuters they were baffled by an apparent lack of arrests despite many of the hackers being based in America. &quot;I would love for somebody to explain it to me,&quot; said Michael Sentonas, president of CrowdStrike, one of the firms leading the response effort to the hacks. 

&quot;For such a small group, they are absolutely causing havoc,&quot; Sentonas told Reuters in an interview last month. Sentonas said the hackers were &quot;known&quot; but didn&#x27;t provide specifics. He did say, &quot;I think there is a failure here.&quot; Asked who was responsible for the failure, Sentonas said, &quot;law enforcement.&quot; [...] Dubbed by some security professionals as &quot;Scattered Spider,&quot; the hacking group has been active since 2021 but it grabbed headlines following a series of intrusions at several high profile American companies.

                              <span>AI could be used to predict if a person is at risk of having a heart attack up to 10 years in the future, a study has found. From a report: The technology could save thousands of lives while improving treatment for almost half of patients, researchers at the University of Oxford said. The study, funded by the British Heart Foundation (BHF), looked at how AI might improve the accuracy of cardiac CT scans, which are used to detect blockages or narrowing in the arteries. 

Prof Charalambos Antoniades, chair of cardiovascular medicine at the BHF and director of the acute multidisciplinary imaging and interventional centre at Oxford, said: &quot;Our study found that some patients presenting in hospital with chest pain -- who are often reassured and sent back home -- are at high risk of having a heart attack in the next decade, even in the absence of any sign of disease in their heart arteries. Here we demonstrated that providing an accurate picture of risk to clinicians can alter, and potentially improve, the course of treatment for many heart patients.&quot; 

About 350,000 people in the UK have a CT scan each year but, according to the BHF, many patients later die of heart attacks due to their failure in picking up small, undetectable narrowings. Researchers analysed the data of more than 40,000 patients undergoing routine cardiac CT scans at eight UK hospitals, with a median follow-up time of 2.7 years. The AI tool was tested on a further 3,393 patients over almost eight years and was able to accurately predict the risk of a heart attack. AI-generated risk scores were then presented to medics for 744 patients, with 45% having their treatment plans altered by medics as a result.

                              <span>Hello again from the Rust Leadership Council!
We wanted to share an update on what the Council has been working on since our last update.
Accomplishments so far
We have elected new project directors!
Through the great work of the Project Director Election Process Committee,
we have defined a process for selecting Project Directors for the Rust Foundation Board of Directors.
We carried out the process, and recently announced the new directors.
We will be following up with a retrospective to identify what went well and what can be improved,
and feed those improvements back into the process for next year.
We have established a new home for Project governance documentation at https://forge.rust-lang.org/governance/index.html.
As changes to the governance policies are accepted via the RFC proce…</span>

                              <span>I can&#x27;t thank Honeypot and Carolina Cabral enough for the producing The Rails Documentary that was just released today. Looking back on those early, formative years of Ruby on Rails with Tobi, Jamis, Jeremy, and Jason was actually kind of profound. I usually don&#x27;t spend much time looking back, so for once to stop and marvel at how we got started twenty years ago was really special. A fitting tribute to two decades of working with Ruby on the web.
Together with 37signals, Rails has been my life&#x27;s work. I&#x27;ve had the pleasure to collaborate with literally thousands of people on evolving the framework, and I&#x27;ve been humbled to see well over a million applications be built with it. Everything from tiny internal apps to $77 billion behemoths like Shopify.
Now one of the reasons I don&#x27;t spend too…</span>

                              <span>The Rust compiler&#x27;s front-end can now use parallel execution to significantly
reduce compile times. To try it, run the nightly compiler with the -Z threads&#x3D;8 option. This feature is currently experimental, and we aim to ship
it in the stable compiler in 2024.
Keep reading to learn why a parallel front-end is needed and how it works, or
just skip ahead to the How to use it
section.
Compile times and parallelism
Rust compile times are a perennial concern. The Compiler Performance Working
Group
has continually improved compiler performance for several years. For example,
in the first 10 months of 2023, there were mean reductions in compile time of
13%,
in peak memory use of
15%,
and in binary size of
7%,
as measured by our performance suite.

                              <span>Hey there!
Here’s the 16th installment of my popular Heard Something, Read Something, Saw Something series.
So, what do we have this time...
Heard Something
Lately I&#x27;ve been enjoying listening to discussions about free will. Do we have it? If so, how much? Always? Sometimes? Never? Is it real or an illusion? I find the concept fascinating. One of my favorite recent conversations (debates?) about the topic was between Russ Roberts and Robert Sapolsky on Robert&#x27;s EconTalk podcast. Listen in. 
Hear it: https://www.econtalk.org/robert-sapolsky-on-determinism-free-will-and-responsibility/
Read Something
Every once in a while you read something that swirls with someone’s body of work and undeniably signals they definitively know what the fuck they’re doing. This is that, by Jonathan Hoefler.
Read it: https://typography.com/blog/text-for-proofing-fonts
Saw Something
Driving Dreams is a wonderful documentary on the golden age of Italian automotive design. Full of colorful characters, poetic stories, and the celebration of an art form — and approach — that&#x27;s now long gone. Well worth the 52 minutes.
See it: https://www.amazon.com/Driving-Dreams-Gianluca-Migliarotti/dp/B07455DCH7/
Until next time.

                              <span>I have a theory.
One of the reasons companies have a hard time moving forward is because they&#x27;ve tangled themselves in the near past. Eyes aimed backwards rather than ahead, staring at the dark, feet in their own concrete.
They&#x27;ve trapped themselves looking for certainty where there isn&#x27;t any. Searching for actionable advice where there are only guesses.
Something sorta went wrong. A project didn&#x27;t go as planned. Some launch didn&#x27;t meet expectations. A number someone felt was in reach didn&#x27;t get hit.
So they look back, scanning the ruins for something shiny. They gather people up and call for a search party. They launch into post-mortems and retrospectives.

                              <span>As React UI controls become more sophisticated, complex logic can get
     intertwined with the visual representation. This makes it hard to reason
     about the behavior of the component, hard to test it, and necessary to
     build similar components that need a different look. Juntao
     Qiu tackles this by using a Headless Component, which
     extracts all non-visual logic and state management, separating the brain of
     a component from its looks.

                              <span>With Postgres 12,
released in 2019, it became possible to swap out Postgres&#x27;s storage
engine.
This is a feature MySQL has supported for a long time. There are at
least 8 different built-in
engines you can pick from. MyRocks, MySQL on
RocksDB, is another popular third-party distribution.
I assume there will be a renaissance of Postgres storage engines. To
date, the efforts are
nascent. OrioleDB and Citus
Columnar
are two promising third-party table access methods being actively
developed.
Why alternative storage engines?
The ability to swap storage engines is useful because different
workloads sometimes benefit from different storage
approaches. Analytics workloads and columnar storage layouts go well
together. Write-heavy
workloads and LSM trees go well
together. And

                              <span>With Postgres 12,
released in 2019, it became possible to swap out Postgres&#x27;s storage
engine.
This is a feature MySQL has supported for a long time. There are at
least 8 different built-in
engines you can pick from. MyRocks, MySQL on
RocksDB, is another popular third-party distribution.
I assume there will be a renaissance of Postgres storage engines. To
date, the efforts are
nascent. OrioleDB and Citus
Columnar
are two promising third-party table access methods being actively
developed.
Why alternative storage engines?
The ability to swap storage engines is useful because different
workloads sometimes benefit from different storage
approaches. Analytics workloads and columnar storage layouts go well
together. Write-heavy
workloads and LSM trees go well
together. And

It&#x27;s been one of the few places where hitting it big has allowed for something that wouldn&#x27;t otherwise be possible. From Lamborghini to Pagani, Porsche to Ferrari, Aston Martin to Bentley, I have owned and loved them all. A+ use of lottery money, would do it again!
It&#x27;s against all these delightful automotive experiences that I&#x27;ve been shocked at how utterly compelling the Tesla Model S Plaid has revealed itself to be. And in just a month&#x27;s worth of ownership.
This is a car that now retails for $86,090 in the US. About the same as an Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio or a BMW M3 with a couple of options. Expensive, premium cars, but far from the realm of the brands mentioned above. And yet, somehow, it&#x27;s proven itself to be as special and as exotic a…</span>

                              <span>During my three years in Denmark, I invested in five local startups. All on the premise that we&#x27;d work towards becoming profitable, remaining in the country, and avoiding the VC timebomb. The one that has already fulfilled all the objectives is Workfeed, and now they&#x27;re ready to take on the American market. It&#x27;s a proud moment!
Workfeed makes employee scheduling software. That might sound pretty boring, but if you run or work at a restaurant (or store or anywhere else in the service industry!) still trying to do things with Excel spreadsheets or call sheets, you know this can be a huge pain and time suck. That&#x27;s exactly the kind of drudgery that software was meant to solve, and Workfeed does an amazing job at this.

                              <span>The most counterintuitive of the Stoic mental exercises is that of negative visualization. Willfully imagining all manner of terrible things that might befall you, but haven&#x27;t yet. Described like this, it sorta sounds like a fancy word of anxiety, but if you look closer, it&#x27;s in fact its opposite.
The point of visualizing the consequences of an accident, the loss of a loved one, or the bankruptcy of your business is not to stew in despair, but to prepare yourself for the inevitability of hardship. Nobody makes it through life entirely on easy mode, and if you haven&#x27;t done any manner of mental preparation, even small setbacks can seem calamitous. So you really ought to prepare.
In this way, negative visualization is like the dojo in The Matrix. It&#x27;s a way to level up your skills inside a si…</span>

Not only has the site stayed up, despite hysteric proclamations that it would crater soon after his personnel changes, but X has been able to increase the pace of experimentation and feature introductions at the same time. It&#x27;s been impressive to watch, regardless of what you think of the politics involved.
Now I understand that for many it&#x27;s indeed impossible to leave those politics aside. And however you&#x27;re aligned, you&#x27;ll find a chart to support your position that X is either thriving or has one foot in the grave. So let&#x27;s not even get into that.

We want to improve the reliability and performance of crate downloads.
&quot;Non-canonical downloads&quot; (that use URLs containing hyphens or underscores where the crate published uses the opposite) are blocking these plans.
On 2023-11-20 support for &quot;non-canonical downloads&quot; will be disabled.
cargo users are unaffected.
What are &quot;non-canonical downloads&quot;?
The &quot;non-canonical downloads&quot; feature allows everyone to download the serde_derive crate from https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/serde_derive/1.0.189/download, but also from https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/SERDE-derive/1.0.189/download, where the underscore was replaced with a hyphen (crates.io normalizes underscores and hyphens to be the same for uniqueness purposes, so it isn&#x27;t possible to publish a crate named serde-derive because serde_de…</span>

                              <span>Around mid-October of 2023 the crates.io team was notified by one of our users that a shields.io badge for their crate stopped working. The issue reporter was kind enough to already debug the problem and figured out that the API request that shields.io sends to crates.io was most likely the problem. Here is a quote from the original issue:
This crate makes heavy use of feature flags which bloat the response payload of the API.
Apparently the API response for this specific crate had broken the 20 MB mark and shields.io wasn&#x27;t particularly happy with this. Interestingly, this crate only had 9 versions published at this point in time. But how do you get to 20 MB with only 9 published versions?
As the quote above already mentions, this crate is using features… a lot of features… almost 23,000!…</span>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;H9NruIjkGEw
Roger Smith is a watchmaker, in the most traditional sense. He apprenticed under George Daniels, one of the best there ever was. And for the first few years, he made everything himself — just him, no one else. Even if you aren’t into watches, I bet you’ll be into Roger W. Smith after you watch the video.
Roger’s workshop is on the Isle of Man — far away from the heart of the industry in Switzerland. In fact, he’s the only watchmaker on the Isle of Man, and one of very few in the UK.
He thinks being far away is a good thing. I love how he puts it:

“The influences just aren’t around, and I can just get on with my days work and just make what I want to make.” -Roger W. Smith

I love that notion — it’s one I’ve tried to hold dear myself. Don’t be influenced too much. Be aware of what’s great, but don’t get other people’s work too deep in your head or you’ll be doing their work, not yours. That kind of influence isn&#x27;t really an influence, it&#x27;s a trap.
It’s so easy to get sucked into other people’s work. Following industry news, attending every conference you can, picking brains. But I’ve often found it better to retreat into your own mind and bring something original. The more you see how other people do what they do, the harder it becomes to do things differently.
So pay attention a little, but not too much — leave more room for your own ideas than for theirs.

                              <span>We have renamed the unstable Generator trait to Coroutine and adjusted all terminology accordingly.
If you want to see all 3800 modified lines of code, you can find the PR here.
Our Generator trait was effectively a coroutine already, so this change was long overdue.
All nightly users using the Generator trait must now update their code to refer to the new feature gate and trait names.
What is the difference?
A generator is just a convenient way to write Iterator implementations.
This means it&#x27;s a coroutine that has no arguments and no return type.
Instead when it returns, that means iteration is over, and the Iterator::next method returns None.
Coming full circle
This change is directly motivated for reintroducing generators, this time with simpler (async/await style)
syntax for creating Iterators. Some discussion about this can be found in the gen fn rfc.
Of course such a massive change would be incomplete without the PR to immediately reintroduce a new concept with the name that was just removed,
so here you can see the MVP for gen blocks that has very weird diagnostics and may panic on you if you poke it too much.</span>

Podcast hosting is to some extent a commodity market, so this was less about pining for a specific feature or even working to reduce the bill. This was about buying from Tom Rossi, the technical cofounder of HigherPixels (who make Buzzsprout), and his team, because we&#x27;d just prefer to do business with them.
I&#x27;ve known Tom from the Rails community for years, but at Rails World a few weeks ago, I really got to know him better. He was there as a supporter of the conference, sponsoring a podcasting booth for Rails podcasts recording on site. We talked about bootstrapping, managing a small company, and working with Rails. We literally saw eye to eye.

                              <span>I often hear from people writing in asking for advice about some broken team dynamic. Someone&#x27;s against them, they&#x27;re against someone, another group doesn&#x27;t want them to do well because it&#x27;ll make them look bad. Management this, team that, individual something or another. People want to know how to handle these unfortunate conditions.
With optimism. With positivity. With good faith efforts, always. Bring your best intent, always. Assume it can happen, always. If that doesn&#x27;t work, alright — but it&#x27;s still the right way.
You&#x27;ve got to cheer for everyone on your team. For everyone you work with. For everyone you work for. Up until the moment you aren&#x27;t here, or they aren&#x27;t there, you&#x27;ve got to want the best for everyone you&#x27;re with.
Sabotaging, back stabbing, quietly rooting against, setting the traps to prove yourself right at their expense... That&#x27;s the worst of you, and it&#x27;s the worst for you.
If you have the power to change the team, change it (don&#x27;t ignore it). If you only have the power to be on the team, be on it (not against it). If you can only muster the power to leave the team, leave it after you&#x27;ve given it everything you&#x27;ve got.
To be better, you have to make better. Bend positive.

                              <span>I love writing and sharing code as open source, but it&#x27;s not an abstract act of pure altruism. The first recipients of these programming gifts are almost always myself and my company. It&#x27;s an intentionally selfish drive first, then a broader benefit second. But, ironically, this is what&#x27;s made my participation in the gift exchange of open source sustainable for twenty years and counting. Putting my own mask on first, so I can keep helping others.
Contrast this perspective to the resentment I occasionally see from open source developers who feel shortchanged by the exchange. People who get sucked in by the ideal of pure altruism and pursue it, but are then disappointed by what they perceive as a lack of reciprocity after a while. This has always seemed like a contradiction in terms to me. T…</span>

                              <span>We are happy to announce that we have completed the process to elect new Project Directors.
The new Project Directors are:
Scott McMurray
Jakob Degen
Santiago Pastorino
They will join Ryan Levick and Mark Rousskov to make up the five members of the Rust Foundation Board of Directors who represent the Rust Project.
The board is made up of Project Directors, who come from and represent the Rust Project, and Member Directors, who represent the corporate members of the Rust Foundation.
Both of these director groups have equal voting power.
We look forward to working with and being represented by this new group of project directors.
We were fortunate to have a number of excellent candidates and this was a difficult decision.
We wish to express our gratitude to all of the candidates who were considered for this role!
We also extend our thanks to the project as a whole who participated by nominating candidates and providing additional feedback once the nominees were published.
Finally, we want to share our appreciation for the Project Director Elections Subcommittee for working to design and facilitate running this election process.
This was a challenging decision for a number of reasons.
This was also our first time doing this process and we learned a lot to use to improve it going forward.
The Project Director Elections Subcommittee will be following up with a retrospective outlining how well we achieved our goals with this process and making suggestions for future elections.
We are expecting another election next year to start a rotating cadence of 2-year terms.
Project governance is about iterating and refining over time.
Once again, we thank all who were involved in this process and we are excited to welcome our new Project Directors.</span>

about building an event-driven cross-platform IO library that used
io_uring on Linux. We sketched out how it works at a high level but I
hadn&#x27;t yet internalized how you actually code with io_uring. So I
strapped myself down this week and wrote some
benchmarks to build my
intuition about io_uring and other IO models.
I started with implementations in Go and ported them to Zig to make
sure I had done the Go versions decently. And I got some help from
King and other internetters to find some inefficiencies in my code.
This post will walk through my process, getting increasingly efficient
(and a little increasingly complex) ways to write an entire file to

                              <span>Over the last 20+ years I’ve been part of too many discussions where someone goes “I’m having a hard time explaining this or that…” Then they say “I just really want to say this…” And then they say it and it’s clear, concise, and obvious! They nailed it, but…


…it’s as if they aren’t even listening to themselves because they’re right back to thinking about how to say what they just said. Only now they’re back to trying to make it more complicated than it needs to be. They should just say it like they said it a minute ago.


This happens to me often as well. Recently I was working on some copy for a new home page design and I just wasn’t locking into my point in writing… So I said a few things out loud. They were better than anything I’d written, but then when I wrote them down I tried doctoring them up a bit because “marketing” and, once again, they fell flat.


We’re all told to be good listeners when someone else is talking, but we should work on being better listeners when we’re talking. We might find that we’ve already got the answers.

must, and we
will, create more advanced human systems to prevent war forevermore.
Human society will mature and overcome its
barbaric history, learning to cooperate with each other so that we can create technological
works of global magnitude, such as orbital rings.


We cannot meaningfully explore space while borders exist on Earth.


Every dollar spent on the military is a blight on the country&#x27;s honor. We
believe that military budget reductions are a cause for celebration because
they symbolize progress towards the space age. We believe that the atomic
bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were the most horrifying, shameful thing
ever done by humanity, to itself. Importantly, we believe that it will
never, ever happen again.


We believe that there are irreversible destructive actions. While some amount of
species extinction is a natural process, the outlier extinction event currently happening
due to the emergence of homo sapiens is a tragedy. We believe that it is our duty to
not only improve technology to enhance our own lives, but also enhance technology
to preserve natural diversity. We believe that Free Market Capitalism is an outdated
technology that has failed to prevent irreversible destruction to our home planet. However,
we believe that human society will migrate to a better system without these flaws,
and will prevent the ultimate irreversible action of self-destruction.


We believe in the simple, physical fact that endless growth is unsustainable,
and we refuse to resolve this problem with war. Instead, we will improve
efficiency and work within the limits of the system, whatever they may be.
We will upgrade our economic system to one that is capable of supporting these
requirements.


Therefore, finally, we believe that it is justified to spend one&#x27;s life or
career in pursuit of science, engineering, and technology, because we believe
in humanity&#x27;s ability to mature and improve to the point where it can wield
ever more powerful tools responsibly.</span>
