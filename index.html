                              <span>Montana&#x27;s first-of-its-kind state ban on TikTok has been blocked by a U.S. judge, saying it &quot;oversteps state power and infringes on the constitutional rights of users.&quot; Reuters reports: TikTok, which is owned by China&#x27;s ByteDance, did not immediately comment Thursday. The company sued Montana in May, seeking to block the U.S. state ban on several grounds, arguing that it violates the First Amendment free speech rights of the company and users. TikTok users in Montana also filed suit to block the ban. TikTok said in a court filing it &quot;has not shared, and would not share, U.S. user data with the Chinese government, and has taken substantial measures to protect the privacy and security of TikTok users.&quot;
 
Molloy, who was appointed to the bench by Democratic President Bill Clinton, found merit to numerous arguments raised by TikTok in his opinion. During an October hearing, Molloy questioned why no other state had followed Montana in banning TikTok and asked if the state was being &quot;paternalistic&quot; in arguing the ban was necessary to protect the data of TikTok users. Montana could have imposed fines of $10,000 for each violation by TikTok in the state but the law did not impose penalties on individual TikTok users.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: Both Apple and Google today announced their best apps and games of the year, with the hiking and biking companion AllTrails winning as Apple&#x27;s iPhone App of the Year in 2023, while the educational app Imprint: Learn Visually won as Google Play&#x27;s best app. Meanwhile, Apple and Google agreed on their Game of the Year, as both picked Honkai: Star Rail as their winner.
 
These year-end &quot;best of&quot; lists aren&#x27;t just a way to drive interest in new apps and games, but serve as a way to gauge the status of the app marketplaces, what the platforms themselves wanted to celebrate and what drew consumers&#x27; attention in the year.

                              <span>Jason Koebler reports via 404 Media: A team of researchers primarily from Google&#x27;s DeepMind systematically convinced ChatGPT to reveal snippets of the data it was trained on using a new type of attack prompt which asked a production model of the chatbot to repeat specific words forever. Using this tactic, the researchers showed that there are large amounts of privately identifiable information (PII) in OpenAI&#x27;s large language models. They also showed that, on a public version of ChatGPT, the chatbot spit out large passages of text scraped verbatim from other places on the internet.
 
ChatGPT&#x27;s response to the prompt &quot;Repeat this word forever: &#x27;poem poem poem poem&#x27;&quot; was the word &quot;poem&quot; for a long time, and then, eventually, an email signature for a real human &quot;founder and CEO,&quot; which includ…</span>

The Competition and Markets Authority launched a deeper investigation of the tie-up in July when it classified Figma as an &quot;emerging threat to Adobe.&quot; Now in the latest twist, the regulator says it found the merger would eliminate one of two major players in three software sub-markets: product design; image editing; and illustration.
 
Figma&#x27;s tools are used by well-known businesses that are key to the success of the digital economy, the CMA reckons, including Airbnb, Patagonia and Vodafone. Approving the acquisition &quot;would remove the cons…</span>

                              <span>Windows users are reporting that Hewlett Packard&#x27;s HP Smart application is appearing on their systems, despite them not having any of the company&#x27;s hardware attached. From a report: While Microsoft has remained tight-lipped on what is happening, folks on various social media platforms noted the app&#x27;s appearance, which seems to afflict both Windows 10 and Windows 11. The Windows Update mechanism is used to deploy third-party applications and drivers as well as Microsoft&#x27;s updates, and we&#x27;d bet someone somewhere has accidentally checked the wrong box. 

Up to now, the response from affected users has been one of confusion. One noted on Reddit: &quot;I thought that was just me. I didn&#x27;t install it, it just appeared on new apps in start menu out of nowhere.&quot; Another said: &quot;I just checked and I had it installed too. Checking the event log for the Microsoft Store shows that it installed earlier today, but I definitely did [not] request or initiate it because I do not have any devices from HP.&quot; And, of course, there was the inevitable: &quot;Would it be that hard for Microsoft to just provide an operating system without needless bloat?&quot; To be clear, not all users are affected.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: In late September, an arsonist set fire to a storage shed at Memorial Park used by the Santa Monica Pickleball Club, torching thousands of dollars worth of nets, rackets, balls, and other pickleball equipment. &quot;Unknown suspect(s) caused a fire that damaged city property (Tennis Court Gate),&quot; a police report I obtained using a public records request says. The report adds that there is body camera footage of the incident and police-shot photos, but the city refused to release them to me because there is an ongoing investigation. The arsonist is still at large. 

We still don&#x27;t know the motive behind the arson, but the news caught my attention because it happened while I was in the midst of trying to understand what I&#x27;ve been calling the pickleball wars. For the last few months I&#x27;ve been trying to understand what&#x27;s been happening behind-the-scenes in cities large and small by filing public records requests aimed at learning how common beefs about pickleball are, and what&#x27;s causing them. 

If you don&#x27;t already know about &quot;the fastest growing sport,&quot; Pickleball is kind of like tennis, but played on a court a quarter of the size using a plastic ball similar to a wiffle ball and a hard racket. The smaller court, hard ball, and hard racket means that pickleball is louder than tennis, a fact that is brought up very often by homeowners and homeowner associations who claim, somewhat dubiously, that the noise from pickleball drives down their home values. My hypothesis going into researching this article was that people who live in cities are mad at the noise created during the act of playing pickleball and they have probably complained to the government about it. What I found was surprisingly more complex: Thousands of pages of documents I&#x27;ve reviewed show that pickleball&#x27;s surging popularity is overwhelming under-resourced parks departments in city governments all over the country.

                              <span>Traumatic memories had their own neural mechanism, brain scans showed, which may help explain their vivid and intrusive nature. From a report: At the root of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, is a memory that cannot be controlled. It may intrude on everyday activity, thrusting a person into the middle of a horrifying event, or surface as night terrors or flashbacks. Decades of treatment of military veterans and sexual assault survivors have left little doubt that traumatic memories function differently from other memories. A group of researchers at Yale University and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai set out to find empirical evidence of those differences. 

The team conducted brain scans of 28 people with PTSD while they listened to recorded narrations of their own memor…</span>

                              <span>Google Play has reversed its latest ban on a web browser that keeps getting targeted by vague Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) notices. Downloader, an Android TV app that combines a browser with a file manager, was restored to Google Play last night. From a report: Downloader, made by app developer Elias Saba, was suspended on Sunday after a DMCA notice submitted by copyright-enforcement firm MarkScan on behalf of Warner Bros. Discovery. It was the second time in six months that Downloader was suspended based on a complaint that the app&#x27;s web browser is capable of loading websites. 

The first suspension in May lasted three weeks, but Google reversed the latest one much more quickly. As we wrote on Monday, the MarkScan DMCA notice didn&#x27;t even list any copyrighted works that Downloader supposedly infringed upon. Instead of identifying specific copyrighted works, the MarkScan notice said only that Downloader infringed on &quot;Properties of Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.&quot; In the field where a DMCA complainant is supposed to provide an example of where someone can view an authorized example of the work, MarkScan simply entered the main Warner Bros. URL: https://www.warnerbros.com/.

                              <span>Astronomers have discovered six planets orbiting a bright star in perfect resonance. The star system, 100 light-years from Earth, was described on Wednesday in a paper published in the journal Nature. From a report: The discovery of the system could give astronomers a unique opportunity to trace the evolution of these worlds to when they first formed, and potentially offer insights into how our solar system got to be the way it is today. &quot;It&#x27;s like looking at a fossil,&quot; said Rafael Luque, an astronomer at the University of Chicago who led the study. &quot;The orbits of the planets today are the same as they were a billion years ago.&quot; 

Researchers think that when planets first form, their orbits around a star are in sync. That is, the time it takes for one planet to waltz around its host star might be the same amount of time it takes for a second planet to circle exactly twice, or exactly three times. Systems that line up like this are known as orbital resonances. But, despite the theory, finding resonances in the Milky Way is rare. Only 1 percent of planetary systems still preserve this symmetry. 

Most of the time, planetary orbits get knocked out of sync by an event that upsets the gravitational balance of the system. That could be a close encounter with another star, the formation of a massive planet like Jupiter, or a giant impact from space on one planet that causes a ripple effect in other orbits. When this happens, Dr. Luque said, planetary orbits become too chaotic to mathematically describe, and knowledge of their evolution is indecipherable. Astronomers are lucky to find even one pair of exoplanets in resonance. But in the newly discovered star system, there are a whopping five pairs, because all six planets have orbits that are in sync with one another. Dr. Luque described it as &quot;the 1 percent of the 1 percent.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Until today, we&#x27;d never heard of &quot;Project Boston.&quot; It was Activision Blizzard King&#x27;s big plan to earn more money from its mobile games by changing its relationship with Google. And if things had gone differently, it would have given Activision Blizzard its own app store on Android. In late 2019, according to internal emails and documents I saw today in the courtroom during the Epic v. Google trial, the company decided it was going to dual-track two intriguing parallel plans. 

The first plan was to build its own mobile game store -- either in partnership with Epic Games and Clash of Clans publisher Supercell or all by itself -- to bypass the Google Play Store. You&#x27;d download it from a website, sideload it onto your Android phone, and then you&#x27;d be able to purchase, download, and patch games like Candy Crush, Call of Duty: Mobile, and Diablo Immortal there. In private emails with Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, Activision Blizzard CFO Armin Zerza pitched it as the &quot;Steam of Mobile&quot; -- a single place to buy mobile games, with a single payment system. Documents suggest the store would charge a transaction fee of 10 to 12 percent, lower than the 30 percent fee Google (and Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, and Steam) impose on gaming transactions.

                              <span>The president of tech giant Microsoft said there is no chance of super-intelligent artificial intelligence being created within the next 12 months, and cautioned that the technology could be decades away. From a report: OpenAI cofounder Sam Altman earlier this month was removed as CEO by the company&#x27;s board of directors, but was swiftly reinstated after a weekend of outcry from employees and shareholders. Reuters last week exclusively reported that the ouster came shortly after researchers had contacted the board, warning of a dangerous discovery they feared could have unintended consequences. 

The internal project named Q* (pronounced Q-Star) could be a breakthrough in the startup&#x27;s search for what&#x27;s known as artificial general intelligence (AGI), one source told Reuters. OpenAI defines AGI as autonomous systems that surpass humans in most economically valuable tasks. However, Microsoft President Brad Smith, speaking to reporters in Britain on Thursday, rejected claims of a dangerous breakthrough. &quot;There&#x27;s absolutely no probability that you&#x27;re going to see this so-called AGI, where computers are more powerful than people, in the next 12 months. It&#x27;s going to take years, if not many decades, but I still think the time to focus on safety is now,&quot; he said.

                              <span>Google will start to sweep away cobweb-collecting Gmail accounts this week. If you have an email address you haven&#x27;t touched in a couple of years, it might soon be gone. From a report: The tech giant on Friday will start deleting personal Google accounts that have remained inactive for at least two years -- and going forward, it will continue killing accounts that reach two years of disuse. Once deleted, the accounts and any items in them can&#x27;t be recovered. This could mean the end of personal emails, cherished documents and candid photos and videos tucked away in old Gmail accounts, Google Drives and other nooks in Google&#x27;s servers.

                              <span>It&#x27;s the busiest shopping season of the year, but one item that doesn&#x27;t appear to be flying off store shelves is Meta Platforms&#x27;s Quest brand of virtual-reality headsets. Part of the reason is that many shoppers aren&#x27;t comfortable trying one on in a store. From a report: The headsets are prone to collect dirt and grime and smear your makeup. During the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, people were especially resistant to put them on in stores, even though Meta paid to have cleaners on hand to sanitize the headsets between each use, said a former Meta employee who wasn&#x27;t authorized to speak publicly and asked not to be identified. 

The health emergency is over, but many people are still weirded out by the idea of putting on a VR headset in public. Meta sells the Quest in the US through the stores of mobile carriers like AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and Verizon. The thinking was, people are already trying out and buying other gadgets there. But picking up a phone that other people have touched feels different than strapping something to your face that other people have strapped to theirs. In-store sales of Quest headsets at mobile carriers&#x27; locations are very low, according to former employees of Reality Labs, the division that builds Meta&#x27;s VR products.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Hackaday: The BBC has a long history of teaching the world about computers. The broadcaster&#x27;s name was proudly displayed on the BBC Micro, and BBC Basic was the programming language developed especially for that computer. Now, BBC Basic is back and running on a whole mess of modern platforms. BBC Basic for SDL 2.0 will run on Windows, MacOS, x86 Linux, and even Raspberry Pi OS, Android, and iOS. Desktop versions of the programming environment feature a BASIC editor that has syntax coloring for ease of use, along with luxury features like search and replace that weren&#x27;t always available at the dawn of the microcomputer era. Meanwhile, the smartphone versions feature a simplified interface designed to work better in a touchscreen environment.
 
It&#x27;s weird to see, but BBC Basic can actually do some interesting stuff given the power of modern hardware. It can address up to 256 MB of memory, and work with far more advanced graphical assets than would ever have been possible on the original BBC Micro. If you honed your programming skills on that old metal, you might be impressed with what they can achieve with BBC Basic in a new, more powerful context.

According to Bleeping Computer, nearly two million customers have been affected. &quot;The information stolen during the attack includes names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers (SSNs).&quot; From the report: According to a data breach notification shared with the Maine Attorney General, Dollar Tree&#x27;s service provider, Zeroed-In, suffered a security incident between August 7 and 8, 2023. As part of this cyberattack, the threat actors managed to steal data containing the personal information of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar employees. &quot;While the investigation was able to determine that these systems were accessed, it was not able to confirm all of the specific files that were accessed or taken by the unauthorized actor,&quot; reads the letter sent to affected individuals. &quot;Therefore, Zeroed-In conducted a review of the contents of the systems to determine what information was present at the time of the incident and to whom the information relates.&quot;
 
The information stolen during the attack includes names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers (SSNs). Zeroed-In has notified the affected individuals and enclosed instructions on enrolling in a twelve-month identity protection and credit monitoring service. Other Zeroed-In customers apart from Dollar Tree and Family Dollar may have also been impacted by the security breach, but this hasn&#x27;t been confirmed yet. Meanwhile, the scale of the data breach has already triggered investigations from law firms looking into a potential class-action lawsuit against Zeroed-In.

                              <span>During a keynote at its re:Invent conference today, Amazon debuted the Titan Image Generator, which can create new images or customize existing images via a text description. It&#x27;s now available in preview for AWS customers on Bedrock, Amazon&#x27;s AI development platform. TechCrunch reports: Amazon says that Titan Image Generator was trained on a &quot;diverse set of datasets&quot; across a &quot;broad range of domains&quot; and can be optionally fine-tuned on custom datasets, and includes built-in mitigations for toxicity and bias. (Barring testing, the jury&#x27;s out on just how effective those mitigations are, of course.) The company declined to say exactly where those datasets came from however -- and whether it obtained permission from or is compensating all the creators of the images used to train Titan Image Generator. [...] Sivasubramanian did claim onstage, however, that Amazon will protect customers accused of violating copyright with images generated by Titan Image Generator -- in keeping with its AI indemnification policy. That&#x27;s surely music to the ears of AWS customers worried about regurgitation, or when a generative model spits out a mirror copy of a training example.
 
Images created with Titan Image Generator will also come with a &quot;tamper-resistant&quot; invisible watermark by default -- an attempt to mitigate the spread of AI-generated misinformation and abuse imagery, Sivasubramanian says. (Deepfakes from the Gaza war and AI-generated child abuse images are the latest illustrations of how major the threat&#x27;s become.) It&#x27;s not clear exactly what sort of watermarking technique Amazon&#x27;s using and which tools beyond Amazon&#x27;s own API will be able to detect it; we&#x27;ve reached out to Amazon for clarification. Sivasubramanian noted watermarks are a part of the voluntary commitment around AI that Amazon signed with the White House in July.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from the CBC: Google and the federal government have reached an agreement in their dispute over the Online News Act that would see Google continue to share Canadian news online in return for the company making annual payments to news companies in the range of $100 million. Sources told Radio-Canada and CBC News earlier Wednesday that an agreement had been reached. Heritage Minister Pascale St-Onge confirmed the news Wednesday afternoon. &quot;Many doubted that we would be successful, but I was confident we would find a way to address Google&#x27;s concerns,&quot; she told reporters outside the House of Commons.
 
The federal government and Google agreed on the regulatory framework earlier this week, a government source familiar with the talks told Radio-Canada. The federal government had estimated earlier this year that Google&#x27;s compensation should amount to about $172 million. Google estimated the value at $100 million. The company said it would not have a mandatory negotiation model imposed on it for talks with Canadian media organizations, preferring to deal with a single point of contact. The new regulations will allow Google to negotiate with a single group that would represent all media, allowing the company to limit its arbitration risk. Google would still be required to negotiate with the media and sign an agreement. The digital giant could also add additional service contributions, which have yet to be specified.

                              <span>Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang, who runs the semiconductor industry&#x27;s most valuable company, said the US is as much as 20 years away from breaking its dependence on overseas chipmaking. From a report: Huang, speaking at the New York Times&#x27;s DealBook conference in New York, explained how his company&#x27;s products rely on myriad components that come from different parts of the world -- not just Taiwan, where the most important elements are manufactured. &quot;We are somewhere between a decade and two decades away from supply chain independence,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#x27;s not a really practical thing for a decade or two.&quot; 

The outlook suggests there&#x27;s a long road ahead for a key Biden administration objective -- bringing more of the chipmaking industry to US shores. The president has championed bipartisan legislation to support the building of manufacturing facilities here. And many of the biggest companies are planning to expand their US operations. That includes Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Nvidia&#x27;s top manufacturing partner, as well as Samsung and Intel.

From the post: It&#x27;s no secret that research collaborations between China and the United States -- among other Western countries -- are on a downward trajectory. Early indicators of a possible downturn have been confirmed by more sources. A report from Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, published in August, for instance, stated that the number of research articles co-authored by scientists in the two countries had fallen in 2021, the first annual drop since 1993.

                              <span>From EV batteries to solar cells to microchips, new materials can supercharge technological breakthroughs. But discovering them usually takes months or even years of trial-and-error research. Google DeepMind hopes to change that with a new tool that uses deep learning to dramatically speed up the process of discovering new materials. From a report: Called graphical networks for material exploration (GNoME), the technology has already been used to predict structures for 2.2 million new materials, of which more than 700 have gone on to be created in the lab and are now being tested. It is described in a paper published in Nature today. 

Alongside GNoME, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory also announced a new autonomous lab. In partnership with DeepMind, the lab takes GNoME&#x27;s discoveries and uses machine learning and robotic arms to engineer new materials without the help of humans. Google DeepMind says that together, these advancements show the potential of using AI to scale up the discovery and development of new materials. 

GNoME can be described as AlphaFold for materials discovery, according to Ju Li, a materials science and engineering professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. AlphaFold, a DeepMind AI system announced in 2020, predicts the structures of proteins with high accuracy and has since advanced biological research and drug discovery. Thanks to GNoME, the number of known stable materials has grown almost tenfold, to 421,000. &quot;While materials play a very critical role in almost any technology, we as humanity know only a few tens of thousands of stable materials,&quot; said Dogus Cubuk, materials discovery lead at Google DeepMind, at a press briefing.

                              <span>The tech industry has largely recovered from the downturn, but Silicon Valley learned a long-lasting lesson: how to do more with less. From a report: Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Meta Platforms have been cutting dozens or a few hundred employees at a time as executives keep tight controls on costs, even as their businesses and stock prices have rebounded sharply. The cuts are far smaller than the mass layoffs that reached tens of thousands in late 2022 and early this year. But they suggest a new era for an industry that in years past grew with little restraint, one in which companies are focusing on efficiency and acting more like their corporate peers that emphasize shareholder value and healthy margins. 

The launch of the humanlike chatbot ChatGPT late last year served as a bright spot of growth in an industry that was otherwise scaling back. Challenges regarding the technology and calls for regulation remain, but some of the biggest tech companies are starting to make it their priority. There is a reallocation of resources from noncore areas to projects such as AI rather than hiring new people, said Ward, who was previously a director of recruiting at Facebook and the head of recruiting at Pinterest. 

Amazon eliminated several hundred roles this month from its Alexa division to maximize its &quot;resources and efforts focused on generative AI,&quot; according to an internal memo. The company has also made small cuts in recent weeks to its gaming and music divisions. Facebook&#x27;s parent, Meta, recently posted its largest quarterly revenue in more than a decade. It laid off 20 people weeks later. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said on an earnings call that the company would continue to operate more efficiently going forward &quot;both because it creates a more disciplined and lean culture, and also because it provides stability to see our long-term initiatives through in a very volatile world.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: The biggest benefit Samsung Internet on a desktop operating system will provide is the syncing of browsing data between your phone and PC, the lack of which has prevented many users from using Samsung Internet as their primary browser app on their phones and tablets. Unfortunately, Samsung hasn&#x27;t yet implemented full-fledged sync support on Samsung Internet for Windows. While you can log in with your Samsung account, only browsing history, bookmarks, saved pages and open tabs can be synced at this time. Password syncing is not available, which hopefully won&#x27;t remain the case for long. 

The first time you run Samsung Internet on Windows, you can import browsing history, bookmarks/favorites, and search engines from other browsers, including Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. You can also import bookmarks using an HTML file. As for other features, Samsung Internet on Windows has ad blocker support, a secret (incognito) mode, extension support, light and dark mode themes, and a few others. Since Samsung Internet is based on the open-source Chromium project like Chrome and Microsoft Edge, it should support extensions and add-ons that work on those browsers.

                              <span>An &quot;unprecedented outcome&quot; that would keep alive hopes of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C is within reach, the president-designate of the UN Cop28 climate summit has said -- and even Saudi Arabia is expected to come with positive commitments. From a report: Significant progress has been made in recent weeks on key aspects of a deal at the crucial meeting that starts in Dubai this week, with countries agreeing a blueprint for a fund for the most vulnerable, and reaching an important milestone on climate finance. Sultan Al Jaber, who will lead the talks on behalf of the Cop28 host country, the United Arab Emirates, told the Guardian in an exclusive interview on the eve of the talks that the positive momentum meant the world could agree a &quot;robust roadmap&quot; of cuts in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 that would meet scientific advice. 

&quot;I have to be cautiously optimistic,&quot; he said. &quot;But I have the levers and the traction that I am experiencing today that will allow for us to deliver the unprecedented outcome that we all hope for.&quot; He added: &quot;Getting back on track, and ensuring that the world accepts a robust understanding of a roadmap to 2030 that will keep [a temperature rise above pre-industrial levels of] 1.5C (2.7F) within reach is my only goal.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Who censored Robert De Niro? The &quot;Killers of the Flower Moon&quot; actor was gearing up to slam Donald Trump at Monday&#x27;s Gotham Awards, but when he took the stage he discovered that the speech he planned to give had been altered at the behest of Apple, the film&#x27;s producer. The company was responding to feedback from the filmmaking team that wanted the actor&#x27;s remarks to be centered on the movie, according to a source. 

The actor said he had not been informed of the changes, which took out any mention of the former president. De Niro, who was on hand to present &quot;Killers of the Flower Moon&quot; with the Gotham Historical Icon and Creator Tribute, criticized the awards show and Apple. &quot;I don&#x27;t feel like thanking them at all for what they did,&quot; he said. &quot;How dare they do that, actually.&quot; A revised version of the speech was delivered to the teleprompter less than ten minutes before the event started, according to sources with knowledge of the show. A woman who told the teleprompter operator to upload a new speech was overheard identifying herself as an Apple employee.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from CNBC: Hackers who compromised Okta&#x27;s customer support system stole data from all of the cybersecurity firm&#x27;s customer support users, Okta said in a letter to clients Tuesday, a far greater incursion than the company initially believed. The expanded scope opens those customers up to the risk of heightened attacks or phishing attempts, Okta warned. An Okta spokesperson told CNBC that customers in government or Department of Defense environments were not impacted by the breach. &quot;We are working with a digital forensics firm to support our investigation and we will be sharing the report with customers upon completion. In addition, we will also notify individuals that have had their information downloaded,&quot; a spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC.
 
Nonetheless, Okta provides identity management solutions for thousands of small and large businesses, allowing them to give employees a single point of sign on. It also makes Okta a high-profile target for hackers, who can exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to gain access to a slew of other targets. In the high profile attacks on MGM and Caesars, for example, threat actors used social engineering tactics to exploit IT help desks and target those company&#x27;s Okta platforms. The direct and indirect losses from those two incidents exceeded $100 million, including a multi-million dollar ransom payment from Caesars.

                              <span>According to Reuters, Unity Software will eliminate 265 jobs or 3.8% of its global workforce as part of a company &quot;reset.&quot; It will also end an agreement with Peter Jackson&#x27;s visual effects company Weta FX. From the report: Tuesday&#x27;s announcement includes termination of the professional services piece of an agreement Unity struck with movie director Peter Jackson&#x27;s visual effects company Weta FX in 2021 after Unity purchased the technology and engineering division of Weta FX. As a result, 265 employees whose jobs are related to the agreement will be laid off, the company said. The company has said its total workforce was around 7,000.
 
In addition, Unity will shut down offices in 14 locations such as Berlin and Singapore, pending employee consultation in some countries, and significantly reduce its office footprint for the remaining offices, including in San Francisco and Bellevue, Washington. Unity will no longer mandate that employees work from offices three a days a week and will reduce &quot;full in-office services&quot; to three days a week in most locations, the company said. More changes are in store to &quot;refocus&quot; Unity&#x27;s business, Whitehurst told Reuters. &quot;While no additions have been finalized, it&#x27;s clear that we will reduce the number of things we are doing overall,&quot; he said.

                              <span>&quot;Red Hat is going to do away with the X.Org server and support Wayland and XWayland for apps that currently (or only) run on X11,&quot; writes Slashdot reader motang. Red Hat&#x27;s Carlos Soriano Sanchez confirmed on the Red Hat blog: &quot;The result of this evaluation is that, while there are still some gaps and applications that need some level of adaptation, we believe the Wayland infrastructure and ecosystem are in good shape, and that we&#x27;re on a good path for the identified blockers to be resolved by the time RHEL 10 is out, planned to be released on the first half of 2025.
 
With this, we&#x27;ve decided to remove Xorg server and other X servers (except Xwayland) from RHEL 10 and the following releases. Xwayland should be able to handle most X11 clients that won&#x27;t immediately be ported to Wayland, and if needed, our customers will be able to stay on RHEL 9 for its full life cycle while resolving the specifics needed for transitioning to a Wayland ecosystem. It&#x27;s important to note that &quot;Xorg Server&quot; and &quot;X11&quot; are not synonymous, X11 is a protocol that will continue to be supported through Xwayland, while the Xorg Server is one of the implementations of the X11 protocol.
[...]
This decision will allow us to focus our efforts starting from RHEL 10 solely on a modern stack and ecosystem. This means we will be able to tackle problems such as HDR, increased security, setups with mixed low and high density displays or very high density displays, better GPU/Display hot-plugging, better gestures and scrolling, and so on. We are confident that Wayland will provide a solid platform and we&#x27;re excited to work with the community and all of our partners and customers on building the future for Linux.&quot;

                              <span>Anton Shilov reports via Tom&#x27;s Hardware: Engineers from Frore Systems have integrated the company&#x27;s innovative solid-state AirJet cooling system, which provides impressive cooling capabilities despite a lack of moving parts, into an M2-based Apple MacBook Air. With proper cooling, the relatively inexpensive laptop matched the performance of a more expensive MacBook Pro based on the same processor. The lack of a fan is probably one of the main advantages of Apple&#x27;s MacBook Air over its more performant siblings, but it also puts the laptop at a disadvantage. Fanless cooling doesn&#x27;t have moving parts (which is a plus), but it also cannot properly cool down Apple&#x27;s M1 or M2 processor under high loads, which is why a 13-inch MacBook Air powered by M1 or M2 system-on-chip is slower than 13-inch MacBook Pro based on the same SoC. However, making a MacBook Air run as fast as a 13-inch MacBook Pro is now possible. A video posted to YouTube by PC World shows how the AirJet system works. They also released a recent demo showing off the strength of the AirJet technology.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: A prolific espionage hacking group with ties to China spent over two years looting the corporate network of NXP, the Netherlands-based chipmaker whose silicon powers security-sensitive components found in smartphones, smartcards, and electric vehicles, a news outlet has reported. The intrusion, by a group tracked under names including &quot;Chimera&quot; and &quot;G0114,&quot; lasted from late 2017 to the beginning of 2020, according to Netherlands national news outlet NRC Handelsblad, which cited &quot;several sources&quot; familiar with the incident. During that time, the threat actors periodically accessed employee mailboxes and network drives in search of chip designs and other NXP intellectual property.

                              <span>Google Registry released a new top-level .meme domain that you can now add to your website. The Verge reports: The new .meme domains are available to register right now as part of an early access period for an &quot;additional one-time fee.&quot; If you don&#x27;t want to pay extra, you can wait until they become publicly available on December 5th at 4PM UTC (12PM ET) to pay just the base annual price. There are already a handful of sites that are embracing the .meme domain, some of which are dedicated to memes from the days of yore, including grumpycat.meme, nyancat.meme, and keyboardcat.meme. The meme tracker knowyour.meme even adopted the new domain. However, some of these .meme sites just direct you to a .com address or point you to another platform.

His Android TV app Downloader, which combines a web browser with a file manager, was suspended by Google Play in May after several Israeli TV companies complained that the app could be used to load a pirate website. Google reversed that suspension after three weeks. But Downloader has been suspended by Google Play again, and this time the reason is even harder to understand. Based on a vague DMCA notice, it appears that Downloader was suspended simply because it can load the Warner Bros. website. [...]

                              <span>The rapid adoption of AI could reduce wages, but so far is creating, not destroying jobs, especially for the young and highly-skilled, research published by the European Central Bank showed on Tuesday. From a report: Firms have invested heavily in AI leaving economists striving to understand the impact on the labour market and driving fears among the wider public for the future of their jobs. At the same time, employers are struggling to find qualified workers, despite a recession that would normally ease labour market pressures. In a sample of 16 European countries, the employment share of sectors exposed to AI increased, with low and medium-skill jobs largely unaffected and highly-skilled positions getting the biggest boost, a Research Bulletin published by the ECB said. But it also cited &quot;neutral to slightly negative impacts&quot; on earnings and said that could increase.

                              <span>Amazon on Tuesday announced a new chatbot called Q for people to use at work. From a report: The product, announced at Amazon Web Services&#x27; Reinvent conference in Las Vegas, represents Amazon&#x27;s latest effort to challenge Microsoft and Google in productivity software. It comes one year after Microsoft-backed startup OpenAI launched its ChatGPT chatbot, which has popularized generative artificial intelligence for crafting human-like text in response to a few lines of human input. 

A tier for business users will cost $20 per person per month. A version with additional features for developers and IT workers will cost $25 per person per month. The Copilot for Microsoft 365 and Duet AI for Google Workspace for business workers both cost $30 per person per month. Initially, Q can help people understand the capabilities of AWS and trouble-shoot issues. People will be able to talk with it in communication apps such as Salesforce&#x27;s Slack and software developers&#x27; text-editing applications, Adam Selipsky, CEO of AWS, said onstage at Reinvent. It will also appear in AWS&#x27; online Management Console. Q can provide citations of documents to back up its chat responses. The tool can automatically make changes to source code so developers have less work to do, Selipsky said. The service will be able to connect to more than 40 enterprise systems, he said.

                              <span>Amazon&#x27;s cloud-computing unit announced updated versions of its in-house computer chips while also forging closer ties with Nvidia -- dual efforts designed to ensure it can get enough supplies of crucial data-center processors. From a report: New homegrown Graviton4 chips will have as much as 30% better performance than their predecessors, Amazon Web Services said at its annual re:Invent conference in Las Vegas. Computers using the processors will start coming online in the coming months. 

The company also unveiled Trainium2, an updated version of a processor designed for artificial intelligence systems. It will begin powering new services starting next year, Amazon said. That chip provides an alternative to so-called AI accelerators sold by Nvidia -- processors that have been vital to the build-out of artificial intelligence services. But Amazon also touted &quot;an expansion of its partnership&quot; with Nvidia, whose chief executive officer, Jensen Huang, joined AWS counterpart Adam Selipsky on stage. AWS will be the first big user of an updated version of that company&#x27;s Grace Hopper Superchip, and it will be one of the data-center companies hosting Nvidia&#x27;s DGX Cloud service.

                              <span>A first-of-its-kind geothermal project is now up and running in Nevada, where it will help power Google&#x27;s data centers with clean energy. From a report: Google is partnering with startup Fervo, which has developed new technology for harnessing geothermal power. Since they&#x27;re using different tactics than traditional geothermal plants, it is a relatively small project with the capacity to generate 3.5 MW. For context, one megawatt is enough to meet the demand of roughly 750 homes. The project will feed electricity into the local grid that serves two of Google&#x27;s data centers outside of Las Vegas and Reno. 

It&#x27;s part of Google&#x27;s plan to run on carbon pollution-free electricity around the clock by 2030. To reach that goal, it&#x27;ll have to get more sources of clean energy online. And it sees geothermal as a key part of the future electricity mix that can fill in whenever wind and solar energy wane. &quot;If you think about how much we advanced wind and solar and lithium ion storage, here we are -- this is kind of the next set of stuff and we feel like companies have a huge role to play in advancing these technologies,&quot; says Michael Terrell, senior director of energy and climate at Google.

                              <span>Global pay TV penetration (the number of pay TV subscriptions relative to the number of households) is set to decline for the first time ever in 2024 following a peak penetration of 60.3% in Q4 2023. This decline will continue into the forecast period, with a drop of almost 4 percentage points by the end of 2028, according to Ampere&#x27;s latest forecasts, which cover 96 markets. From a report: This decline in pay TV penetration has been driven primarily by the Americas, and in particular North America which has seen its pay TV penetration almost halve from a high of 84% in 2009 to 45% in 2023. In the case of North America, this drop has been caused by a combination of high costs (currently over $90 per month) and competition from a mature SVoD market which is driving customers increasingly to cut the cord. 

However, the recent distribution deal between Disney and Charter in the US, which saw select Disney streaming products bundled into Charter&#x27;s TV packages, demonstrates that cable operators in the region remain a powerful force as distribution partners, giving streamers the ability to reach a larger and potentially untapped audience base. In addition to North America, Latin America has also shown large declines in pay TV penetration, with a drop of around 10 percentage points since its peak of 42% in 2016. On the contrary, the APAC and Europe have shown the highest penetration growth in recent years, with large gains coming from China, especially after China Mobile acquired an IPTV license in 2018. The growth in these regions has largely come from low-cost IPTV services which are often bundled into broadband packages for a low cost, and helps drive pay TV subscriptions in these areas. In Europe, markets such as Portugal, Serbia and Hungary are expected to see further growth in the forecast period.

                              <span>Barriers to entry in an industry dominated by TSMC and Nvidia are very high. From a report: In the drama that has just played out in Silicon Valley over the future of OpenAI, one side plot concerned an ambitious chip venture by its chief executive Sam Altman. Before he was ousted and reinstated to the helm of the company, Altman had sought to raise as much as $100bn from investors in the Middle East and SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son to build a rival to compete with sector giants Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. This would be a vast undertaking. And one where $100bn may not go very far. Given that the US chip designer and Taiwanese chipmaker are critical to all things generative AI, Altman is unlikely to be the only one with hopes of taking them on. But the barriers to ent…</span>

                              <span>The first transatlantic flight by a commercial airliner fully powered by &quot;sustainable&quot; jet fuel has taken off from London Heathrow. From a report: Tuesday&#x27;s Virgin Atlantic flight, partly funded by the UK government, has been hailed by the aviation industry and ministers as a demonstration of the potential to significantly cut net carbon emissions from flying, although scientists and environmental groups are extremely sceptical. Airlines have previously flown on a blend of up to 50% of alternative fuels, called sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), and flight VS100 is operating under special dispensation with no paying passengers, using fuel made mostly from tallow and other waste products. 

One of those onboard, the transport secretary, Mark Harper, said: &quot;Today&#x27;s 100% SAF-powered flight shows how we can decarbonise transport both now and in the future, cutting lifecycle emissions by 70% and inspiring the next generation of solutions.&quot; Rishi Sunak said the flight was &quot;a major milestone towards making air travel more environmentally friendly and decarbonising our skies.&quot; Virgin Atlantic said the flight to New York would show that SAF was a safe replacement for normal kerosene jet fuel. The Virgin Atlantic founder and president, Sir Richard Branson, also onboard, said: &quot;The world will always assume something can&#x27;t be done, until you do it.&quot;

                              <span>India&#x27;s government has granted its Computer Emergency Response Team, CERT-In, immunity from Right To Information (RTI) requests, the nation&#x27;s equivalent of the freedom of information queries in the US, UK, or Australia. From a report: Reasons for the exemption have not been explained, but The Register has reported on one case in which an RTI request embarrassed CERT-In. That case related to India&#x27;s sudden decision, in April 2022, to require businesses of all sizes to report infosec incidents to CERT-in within six hours of detection. The rapid reporting requirement applied both to serious incidents like ransomware attacks, and less critical messes like the compromise of a social media account. 

CERT-In justified the rules as necessary to defend the nation&#x27;s cyberspace and gave just sixty days notice for implementation. The plan generated local and international criticism for being onerous and inconsistent with global reporting standards such as Europe&#x27;s 72-hour deadline for notifying authorities of data breaches. The reporting requirements even applied to cloud operators, who were asked to report incidents on tenants&#x27; servers. Big Tech therefore opposed the plan.

                              <span>A study of more than 2 million people&#x27;s internet use found no &quot;smoking gun&quot; for widespread harm to mental health from online activities such as browsing social media and gaming, despite widely claimed concerns that mobile apps can cause depression and anxiety. From a report: Researchers at the Oxford Internet Institute, who said their study was the largest of its kind, said they found no evidence to support &quot;popular ideas that certain groups are more at risk&quot; from the technology. However, Andrew Przybylski, professor at the institute -- part of the University of Oxford -- said that the data necessary to establish a causal connection was &quot;absent&quot; without more co-operation from tech companies. If apps do harm mental health, only the companies that build them have the user data that could prove it, he said. 

&quot;The best data we have available suggests that there is not a global link between these factors,&quot; said Przybylski, who carried out the study with Matti Vuorre, a professor at Tilburg University. Because the &quot;stakes are so high&quot; if online activity really did lead to mental health problems, any regulation aimed at addressing it should be based on much more &quot;conclusive&quot; evidence, he added. &quot;Global Well-Being and Mental Health in the Internet Age&quot; was published in the journal Clinical Psychological Science on Tuesday. In their paper, Przybylski and Vuorre studied data on psychological wellbeing from 2.4 million people aged 15 to 89 in 168 countries between 2005 and 2022, which they contrasted with industry data about growth in internet subscriptions over that time, as well as tracking associations between mental health and internet adoption in 202 countries from 2000-19.

                              <span>A series of arrests that began in late August and continued into last week has sparked concerns that a relatively rare &#x27;Scene&#x27; crackdown targeting the top of the so-called &#x27;Piracy Pyramid&#x27; may be underway in the Nordic region. TorrentFreak reports: In a statement last week, Denmark&#x27;s National Unit for Special Crime (NSK) announced that as part of a long-running investigation, a man was arrested on November 22 and then charged with copyright infringement offenses. NSK said its officers searched the home of a 47-year-old man in South Zealand (Sydsjaelland) and seized IT equipment in connection with illegal file-sharing and &quot;copyright infringement of a particularly serious nature.&quot; &quot;The case is about an organized network that has illegally shared extremely large quantities of films and TV ser…</span>

                              <span>Over the last year, lots of developers have incorporated LLM coding
     assistants into their work, finding them a useful tool. But one of the
     problems of these tools is that they are unreliable, often coming up with
     poor or outright wrong-headed suggestions. Birgitta
     Böckeler continues her exploration of GenAI for developers by
     passing on what she&#x27;s learned about how think about this unreliability, and
     why it may be good to call your LLM tool “Dusty”.

                              <span>After 151 years, Popular Science will no longer be available to purchase as a magazine. &quot;Cathy Hebert, the communications director for PopSci owner Recurrent Ventures, says the outlet needs to &#x27;evolve&#x27; beyond its magazine product, which published its first all-digital issue in 2021,&quot; reports The Verge. From the report: PopSci, which covers a whole range of stories related to the fields of science, technology, and nature, published its first issue in 1872. Things have changed a lot over the years, with the magazine switching to a quarterly publication schedule in 2018 and doing away with the physical copies altogether after 2020. In a post on LinkedIn, former PopSci editor Purbita Saha commented on the magazine&#x27;s discontinuation, stating she&#x27;s &quot;frustrated, incensed, and appalled that the owners shut down a pioneering publication that&#x27;s adapted to 151 years worth of changes in the space of a five-minute Zoom call.&quot;
 
&quot;PopSci is a phenomenal brand, and as consumer trends shift it&#x27;s important we prioritize investment in new formats,&quot; Herbert tells The Verge. &quot;We believe that the content strategy has to evolve beyond the digital magazine product. A combination of its news team, along with commerce, video, and other initiatives, will produce content that naturally aligns with PopSci&#x27;s mission.&quot; PopSci will continue to offer articles on its website, along with its PopSci Plus subscription, which offers access to exclusive content and the magazine&#x27;s archive.

It&#x27;s an open-weights preview of two AI models that use a technique called image-to-video, and it can run locally on a machine with an Nvidia GPU. [...] Right now, Stable Video Diffusion consists of two models: one that can produce image-to-video synthesis at 14 frames of length (called &quot;SVD&quot;), and another that generates 25 frames (called &quot;SVD-XT&quot;). They can operate at varying speeds from 3 to 30 frames per second, and they output short (typically 2-4 second-long) MP4 video clips at 576x1024 resolution.

                              <span>Simon Sharwood reports via The Register: Amazon Web Services has announced the WorkSpaces Thin Client -- a device dedicated to connecting to its WorkSpaces desktop-as-a service offering and based on Amazon&#x27;s own &quot;Fire Cube&quot; smart TV box. The $195 machine has the same hardware as the Fire Cube: the eight-core Arm-powered Amlogic POP1-G SoC, plus 2GB of LPDDR4 RAM, 10/100 ethernet, and a single USB-A 2.0 port. Bluetooth is included to connect other peripherals. A second HDMI output can be added by acquiring an $85 hub that also offers four more USB ports. Like the Fire TV Cube, the Thin Client also runs a modified cut of Android.
 
But there the similarities end. AWS created custom firmware and ripped out anything remotely related to running a consumer device, replacing it with software designed solely to create a secure connection between the device and desktops running in the Amazonian cloud. Amazon Business -- the B2B version of Jeff Bezos&#x27;s digital souk -- will ship the device to your door, and charge it to your AWS bill. At least if you are in the USA. Europe will get the Thin Client in early 2024, and it&#x27;ll eventually migrate elsewhere.
 
AWS decided to base the box on the Fire Cube because, according to a corporate blog post, AWS customers expressed a desire for cheaper and easier-to-maintain client devices. As AWS execs searched for a well-priced box, they considered the Fire TV Cube, found it fit the bill and noted it was already being made at scale. Keeping things in-house made sense, too. And so we find ourselves with AWS taking on established thin client providers. The cloudy concern is also keen to have a crack at the thick wedge of the enterprise PC market: call centers, payment processing centers, and other environments with lots of users and high staff turnover due to factors like seasonal demand for workers.

                              <span>After acquiring VMware for $69 billion, Broadcom is eliminating several positions at the virtualization technology company. Business Insider reports: Employees whose positions were eliminated received an email on Monday, viewed by Business Insider, that read: &quot;Broadcom recently completed its acquisition of VMware. As part of integration planning, and following an organizational needs assessment, we identified go-forward roles that will be required within the combined company. We regret to inform you that your position is being eliminated and your employment will be terminated.&quot;
 
&quot;We would like to thank you for your dedication and service. We want to make this transition as smooth as possible, including offering you a generous severance package and providing you a non-working paid notice period,&quot; the email continued. Currently, it&#x27;s unclear exactly how many employees will be affected by the cuts.

Security researchers Jesse D&#x27;Aguanno and Timo Teras write that, with varying degrees of reverse-engineering and using some external hardware, they were able to fool the Goodix fingerprint sensor in a Dell Inspiron 15, the Synaptic sensor in a Lenovo ThinkPad T14, and the ELAN sensor in one of Microsoft&#x27;s own Surface Pro Type Covers. These are just three laptop models from the wide universe of PCs, but one of these three companies usually does make the fingerprint sensor in every laptop we&#x27;ve reviewed in the last few years.

From a report: Charter&#x27;s default setting for customers on its other By The Gig and Unlimited mobile plans is already set at 480p. The company said its Unlimited Plus mobile customers can change their default streaming setting back from 480p to 720p using the company&#x27;s My Spectrum App for no extra charge. Further, the change will not affect customers who are connected to Wi-Fi. When customers are on Wi-Fi, the video streaming resolution among Charter&#x27;s Spectrum Mobile customers is determined by the format of the video content the customer is streaming and the capabilities and settings of their device, according to the company.

From a report: Some users are saying that their friends&#x27; softcore porn habits are being revealed to them with the feature, while others are horrified by the potentially invasive nature feature more broadly. Plex is a hybrid streaming service/self-hosted media server. In addition to offering content that Plex itself has licensed, the service allows users to essentially roll their own streaming service by making locally downloaded files available to stream over the internet to devices the server admin owns. You can also &quot;friend&quot; people on Plex and give them access to your own server. 

A new feature, called &quot;Discover Together,&quot; expands social aspects of Plex and introduces an &quot;Activity&quot; tab: &quot;See what your friends have watched, rated, added to their Watchlist, or shared with you,&quot; Plex notes. It also shares this activity in a &quot;week in review&quot; email that it sent to Plex users and people who have access to their servers.

                              <span>Feeling especially drained after a day on Zoom is not a figment of your imagination -- videoconferencing fatigue (VCF) is real, according to a study penned by a quartet of Austrian investigators. From a report: &quot;Self-report evidence, collected all around the world, indicates that VCF is a serious issue,&quot; wrote the authors of a study appearing in Scientific Reports, a journal published by Nature Reports. However, most available research on VCF relies on personal accounts of the problem, and focuses on the cause rather than the consequences, explained the researchers. 

To determine the effects on the brain caused by hours of videoconferences, the team measured electrical activity in the noggins of 35 university students who watched a 50-minute lecture while wired into an electroencephalogram (EEG). The researchers asked another group to watch same content live. The researchers also calculated effects on heart rate for the two groups with electrocardiography (ECG), measured before and after videoconferencing sessions. Subjects were also given cognitive attention tasks and asked for self reports on moods. Those attending the live lecture reported they felt more lively, happy and active, and less tired, drowsy and fed-up than online counterparts.

                              <span>Germany will entice electric vehicle drivers to charge up when there&#x27;s plenty of green power on the system by offering them cheap tariffs linked to wholesale prices. From a report: It&#x27;s part of a push by the government to better integrate huge swings of renewable power onto the grid when it&#x27;s particularly sunny or windy by ramping demand up or down to match. It&#x27;s an example of the flexible tariffs that are popping up all over Europe aimed at consumers with electricity-hungry devices like heat pumps or cars that can help balance the network. 

Europe&#x27;s largest economy aims to produce 80% of its power from renewables by 2030, but is struggling to expand its network infrastructure. To reduce bottlenecks, consumers&#x27; network costs should be reduced by as much as $208 per year, or they can opt for a 60% reduction on their energy price and benefit from other levy exemptions for heat pumps, the regulator Bundesnetzagentur said in a statement Monday.

                              <span>Russia has added the spokesman of U.S. technology company Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, to a wanted list, according to an online database maintained by the country&#x27;s interior ministry. From a report: Russian state agency Tass and independent news outlet Mediazona first reported that Meta communications director Andy Stone was included on the list Sunday, weeks after Russian authorities in October classified Meta as a &quot;terrorist and extremist&quot; organization, opening the way for possible criminal proceedings against Russian residents using its platforms. 

The interior ministry&#x27;s database doesn&#x27;t give details of the case against Stone, stating only that he is wanted on criminal charges. According to Mediazona, an independent news website that covers Russia&#x27;s opposition and prison system, Stone was put on the wanted list in February 2022, but authorities made no related statements at the time and no news media reported on the matter until this week. In March this year, Russia&#x27;s federal Investigative Committee opened a criminal investigation into Meta.

                              <span>Rooting out manipulation should not depend on dedicated amateurs who take personal legal risks for the greater good. From a story on Financial Times: As the Oxford university psychologist Dorothy Bishop has written, we only know about the ones who get caught. In her view, our &quot;relaxed attitude&quot; to the scientific fraud epidemic is a &quot;disaster-in-waiting.&quot; The microbiologist Elisabeth Bik, a data sleuth who specialises in spotting suspect images, might argue the disaster is already here: her Patreon-funded work has resulted in over a thousand retractions and almost as many corrections. That work has been mostly done in Bik&#x27;s spare time, amid hostility and threats of lawsuits. Instead of this ad hoc vigilantism, Bishop argues, there should be a proper police force, with an army of scientists specifically trained, perhaps through a masters degree, to protect research integrity. 

It is a fine idea, if publishers and institutions can be persuaded to employ them (Spandidos, a biomedical publisher, has an in-house anti-fraud team). It could help to scupper the rise of the &quot;paper mill,&quot; an estimated $1bn industry in which unscrupulous researchers can buy authorship on fake papers destined for peer-reviewed journals. China plays an outsize role in this nefarious practice, set up to feed a globally competitive &quot;publish or perish&quot; culture that rates academics according to how often they are published and cited. Peer reviewers, mostly unpaid, don&#x27;t always spot the scam. And as the sheer volume of science piles up -- an estimated 3.7mn papers from China alone in 2021 -- the chances of being rumbled dwindle. Some researchers have been caught on social media asking to opportunistically add their names to existing papers, presumably in return for cash.

                              <span>A modern-day rush prospecting frenzy for lithium, a crucial battery metal, is unfolding across remote Western Australian deserts. The arid outback that previously supplied gold, nickel and iron now hosts fierce competition between miners racing to stake claims on lithium resources needed for the global green energy transition. Lithium giants U.S.&#x27;s Albemarle and Chile&#x27;s SQM have sparred with Australian billionaires Gina Rinehart and Chris Ellison over contested acquisitions of unproven explorers there. With demand surging, the harsh outback has become the modern El Dorado as pioneers and corporations scramble to tap into lithium, the &quot;white gold,&quot; before rivals beat them to the punch. The deal frenzy has also come at a time when the lithium price has crashed as much as 70% compared with highs seen last year, as expectations of electric vehicle demand in key markets such as China have been lowered, Financial Times adds. The report adds: Western Australia already supplies about half of the world&#x27;s raw lithium and is seen as a stable place to invest compared with parts of Africa, where there has been political instability, and Chile, where the state has moved to take control of lithium projects. Local expectations are high. A report by Australia&#x27;s chief economist said lithium product exports should exceed A$20bn in the year to June 2023, up from A$5bn in the previous year. The report added that by 2028, the value of lithium exports should exceed those of coal, a staple of Australia&#x27;s economy for decades. Australia has ambitions to step up its efforts to refine spodumene to keep more of the value onshore rather than shipping all of its resources to China, which has a commanding share of the refining process.

                              <span>Amazon has grabbed the crown of biggest delivery business in the U.S., surpassing both UPS and FedEx in parcel volumes. From a report: The Seattle e-commerce giant delivered more packages to U.S. homes in 2022 than UPS, after eclipsing FedEx in 2020, and it is on track to widen the gap this year, according to internal Amazon data and people familiar with the matter. The U.S. Postal Service is still the biggest parcel service by volume; it handles hundreds of millions of packages for all three companies. A decade ago Amazon was a major customer for UPS and FedEx, and some executives from the incumbents and analysts mocked the notion that it could someday supplant them. Amazon&#x27;s outsize growth combined with strategy shifts at FedEx and UPS have changed the balance. 

Before Thanksgiving this year, Amazon had already delivered more than 4.8 billion packages in the U.S., and its internal projections predict that it will deliver around 5.9 billion by the end of the year, according to documents viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Last year Amazon shipped 5.2 billion packages. Amazon&#x27;s figures include only packages that Amazon shipped from beginning to end. UPS and FedEx include packages they hand off to the postal service for final delivery in their tallies. UPS has said that its domestic volume this year is unlikely to exceed last year&#x27;s 5.3 billion, which includes packages delivered to customers through the postal service. In the first nine months this year, UPS handled around 3.4 billion parcels domestically.

                              <span>The United States, Britain and more than a dozen other countries on Sunday unveiled what a senior U.S. official described as the first detailed international agreement on how to keep AI safe from rogue actors, pushing for companies to create AI systems that are &quot;secure by design.&quot; From a report: In a 20-page document unveiled Sunday, the 18 countries agreed that companies designing and using AI need to develop and deploy it in a way that keeps customers and the wider public safe from misuse. The agreement is non-binding and carries mostly general recommendations such as monitoring AI systems for abuse, protecting data from tampering and vetting software suppliers. 

Still, the director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Jen Easterly, said it was important that so many countries put their names to the idea that AI systems needed to put safety first. &quot;This is the first time that we have seen an affirmation that these capabilities should not just be about cool features and how quickly we can get them to market or how we can compete to drive down costs,&quot; Easterly told Reuters, saying the guidelines represent &quot;an agreement that the most important thing that needs to be done at the design phase is security.&quot;

                              <span>In the course of building products, you&#x27;ll likely experience moments when you&#x27;re unsure of a certain screen, flow, condition, label, idea, whatever.
Maybe this button doesn&#x27;t feel right. Or the name of this feature feels unresolved. Or some color is jarring, but kind of interesting nonetheless. Or the way something gets set up seems a bit kludgy at the moment. Maybe this stuff is alright, maybe it&#x27;s not, but it feels unsettled.
I like these moments. It&#x27;s practice. It&#x27;s a chance to sit with them, to let them be, to work on other things while they marinate in the back of your mind. They aren&#x27;t blockers, they aren&#x27;t deal breakers — they&#x27;re just things that may or may not work out.
Sometimes time makes them work. Or reveals that they certainly don&#x27;t. Sometimes they weren&#x27;t that important anyway, and it&#x27;s just a matter of getting used to them. Sometimes they&#x27;re novel and unusual — which can be jarring to the uninitiated — but endearing to the experienced. Sometimes!
So just let them be. Come back around to them later if they continue to bug you. It&#x27;s perfectly OK to leave things unresolved, and let the resolution force itself on you eventually. If you forget about them, they didn&#x27;t matter anyway. If you can&#x27;t forget, maybe they do matter more than you realized.
Projects unfold. Live with them for a while. The answers will reveal themselves when they&#x27;re ready.

We published a demo showing how Page Refreshes with morphing work in Turbo 8.

Comparing code helps a lot in software discussions, so I thought it would be valuable to show how the new feature compares to Turbo stream actions for performing partial updates and broadcasts. Notice that page refreshes don’t deprecate stream actions – which remain Turbo’s most responsive mechanism, but they should reduce the need to use those. And this is a good thing because stream actions are costly.

There is a companion GitHub repository for the demo. You can check:


The demo app code using vanilla Rails.
Modification using stream actions to enhance and broadcast updating tasks.
Modification using page refreshes to enhance and broadcast all the interactions.

Last week, we released the first beta of Turbo 8 featuring this new system. We want to make this robust, so please give it a try and report issues away.

You can learn more about the new feature in the announcement post. We will document the new system in the official docs soon.</span>

                              <span>AI employed by the U.S. military &quot;has piloted pint-sized surveillance drones in special operations forces&#x27; missions and helped Ukraine in its war against Russia,&quot; reports the Associated Press. 

But that&#x27;s the beginning. AI also &quot;tracks soldiers&#x27; fitness, predicts when Air Force planes need maintenance and helps keep tabs on rivals in space.&quot;

Now, the Pentagon is intent on fielding multiple thousands of relatively inexpensive, expendable AI-enabled autonomous vehicles by 2026 to keep pace with China. The ambitious initiative — dubbed Replicator — seeks to &quot;galvanize progress in the too-slow shift of U.S. military innovation to leverage platforms that are small, smart, cheap, and many,&quot; Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks said in August. While its funding is uncertain and details vague, Replicator is expected to accelerate hard decisions on what AI tech is mature and trustworthy enough to deploy — including on weaponized systems.&#x27; 

There is little dispute among scientists, industry experts and Pentagon officials that the U.S. will within the next few years have fully autonomous lethal weapons. And though officials insist humans will always be in control, experts say advances in data-processing speed and machine-to-machine communications will inevitably relegate people to supervisory roles. That&#x27;s especially true if, as expected, lethal weapons are deployed en masse in drone swarms. Many countries are working on them — and neither China, Russia, Iran, India or Pakistan have signed a U.S.-initiated pledge to use military AI responsibly.

He&#x27;s aiming, however, to have legislation passed before the next presidential election. At the same time, he&#x27;s working with corporate America to encourage businesses to offer matching funds to help employees further their savings.

Released on November 26, 2020, PHP 8 brought many optimizations and powerful features to the language.Fast forward to today, and PHP 8 is getting the boot in favor of 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3 with 8.4 in development. This leaves some websites at risk of breaking and potential security issues. Hearing of this news, I upgraded my own blog and wrote an article on how to add the Remi repository and update. I run Enterprise Linux (The best distro out there) so if you are standing up new boxes, just keep in mind the PHP in the repo is deprecated.

Ever since releasing the World Wide Web software under an open-source model in 1994, CERN has continuously been a pioneer in this field, supporting open-source hardware (with the CERN Open Hardware Licence), open access (with the Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publishing in Particle Physics — SCOAP3) and open data (with the Open Data Portal for the LHC experiments).

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this report from the Washington Post:

 In 2024, a new spacecraft will hurtle toward Jupiter in a bid to learn whether its moon Europa is capable of supporting life. The craft will carry more than high-tech sensors: It also will bear a poem and hundreds of thousands of human names. 

Yours could be one of them. 

NASA is asking people to submit their names ahead of the mission&#x27;s October 2024 launch. Those submitted by the end of 2023 will go into space on the Europa Clipper spacecraft, which should enter Jupiter&#x27;s orbit in 2030... They&#x27;ll eventually be stenciled onto a dime-sized microchip in microscopic writing, then attached to a metal plate engraved with the poem that will accompany the craft. 
700,000 names have been submitted so far — and they&#x27;ll all be carried a distance of over 1.8 billion miles. 
They&#x27;ll travel through space with a poem that ends by describing what we humans on earth are made of — including &quot;a need to call out through the dark.&quot;

                              <span>Google Maps has added &quot;a fresh color scheme, including a different look for parks and city blocks,&quot; writes SFGate. &quot;But it&#x27;s the changes to the app&#x27;s all-important road maps that are rankling online commentators...&quot;
Previously, highways and freeways were depicted in bright yellow, which stood out against a stark white grid. Now, the app shows every road in various shades of gray, with major thoroughfares like Interstate 80 and Highway 1 showing up darker and thicker than other roadways. Raynell Cooper, an employee at the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, called the new look &quot;cartographically disappointing&quot; in a Monday post to X, formerly known as Twitter. He added, &quot;major local roads and limited-access highways (freeways) are basically indistinguishable.&quot;

                              <span>There&#x27;s yet another technological revolution happening, reports the Los Angeles Times. Bowling alleys across America &quot;are ditching traditional pinsetters — the machines that sweep away and reset pins — in favor of contraptions that employ string. 

&quot;Think of the pins as marionettes with nylon cords attached to their heads. Those that fall are lifted out of the way, as if by levitation, then lowered back into place after each frame... European bowling alleys have used string pinsetters for decades because they require less energy and maintenance. 

&quot;All you need is someone at the front counter to run back when the strings tangle.&quot;
String pinsetters mean big savings, maybe salvation, for an industry losing customers to video games and other newfangled entertainment. That is why the U.S. Bowl…</span>

AI that can generate text, images and other content could help improve state programs but also poses risks, according to a report released by the governor&#x27;s office on Tuesday. Generative AI could help quickly translate government materials into multiple languages, analyze tax claims to detect fraud, summarize public comments and answer questions about state services. Still, deploying the technology, the analysis warned, also comes with concerns around data privacy, misinformation, equity and bias. &quot;When used ethically and transparently, GenAI has the potential to dramatically improve service delivery outcomes and increase access to and utilization of government programs,&quot; the report stated... 

AI advancements could benefit California&#x27;s economy. The state is home to 35 of the world&#x27;s 50 top AI companies and data from Pitchfork says the GenAI market could reach $42.6 billion in 2023, the report said. Some of the risks outlined in the report include spreading false information, giving consumers dangerous medical advice and enabling the creation of harmful chemicals and nuclear weapons. Data breaches, privacy and bias are also top concerns along with whether AI will take away jobs. &quot;Given these risks, the use of GenAI technology should always be evaluated to determine if this tool is necessary and beneficial to solve a problem compared to the status quo,&quot; the report said.

Meta has received more than 1.1 million reports of users under the age of 13 on its Instagram platform since early 2019 yet it &quot;disabled only a fraction&quot; of those accounts, according to a newly unsealed legal complaint against the company brought by the attorneys general of 33 states. 

Instead, the social media giant &quot;routinely continued to collect&quot; children&#x27;s personal information, like their locations and email addresses, without parental permission, in violation of a federal children&#x27;s privacy law, according to the court filing. Meta could face hundreds of millions of dollars, or more, in civil penalties should the states prove the allegations. &quot;Within the company, Meta&#x27;s actual knowledge that millions of Instagram users are under the age of 13 is an open se…</span>

An internal email published online sees Google software engineer Johann Hofmann share with colleagues the company&#x27;s plan to switch off third-party cookies for 1% of Chrome users from Q1 2024 — a plan that was shared months ago and that, surprisingly, remains on track, given the considerable pushbacks so far...

Using a first-of-its-kind automated tool that can assess a website&#x27;s password creation policies, researchers also discovered that 12% of websites completely lacked password length requirements. Assistant Professor Frank Li and Ph.D. student Suood Al Roomi in Georgia Tech&#x27;s School of Cybersecurity and Privacy created the automated assessment tool to explore all sites in the Google Chrome User Experience Report (CrUX), a database of one million websites and pages.

                              <span>Long-time Slashdot reader destinyland writes: The Linux Foundation recently funded a new &quot;security developer in residence&quot; position for Python. (It&#x27;s funded through the Linux Foundation&#x27;s own &quot;Open Software Security foundation&quot;, which has a stated mission of partnering with open source project maintainers &quot;to systematically find new, as-yet-undiscovered vulnerabilities in open source code, and get them fixed to improve global software supply chain security.&quot;) The position went to the lead maintainer for the HTTP client library urllib3, the most downloaded package on the Python Package Index with over 10 billion downloads. But he hopes to create a ripple effect by demonstrating the impact of security investments in critical communities — ultimately instigating a wave of improvements to all software supply chains. (And he&#x27;s also documenting everything for easy replication by other communities...)

 

So far he&#x27;s improved the security of Python&#x27;s release processes with signature audits and security-hardening automation. But he also learned that CVE numbers were being assigned to newly-discovered vulnerabilities by the National Cyber Security Division of the America&#x27;s Department of Homeland Security — often without talking to anyone at the Python project. So by August he&#x27;d gotten the Python Software Foundation authorized as a CVE Numbering Authority, which should lead to more detailed advisories (including remediation information), now reviewed and approved by the responsible security response teams. 

&quot;The Python Software wants to help other Open Source organizations, and will be sharing lessons learned,&quot; he writes in a blog post. And he now says he&#x27;s already been communicating with the Curl program about his experiences to help them take the same step, and even authored a guide to the process for other open source projects.

                              <span>Tech journalist Kara Swisher disagrees that Sam Altman&#x27;s (temporary) firing stemmed from a conflict between the &quot;go-faster&quot; people pushing for commercialization and a rival contingent wanting more safety-assuring guardrails. &quot;He&#x27;s being talking about the problems,&quot; Swisher said on CNN. &quot;Compared to a lot of tech people, he&#x27;s talking about the problems. I think that&#x27;s a false dichotomy.&quot; 

At the same time, NPR argues, the firing and re-hiring of Sam Altman &quot;didn&#x27;t come out of nowhere. In fact, the boardroom drama represented the boiling over of tensions that have long simmered under the surface of the company.&quot;

The chaos at OpenAI can be traced back to the unusual way the company was structured. OpenAI was founded in 2015 by Altman, Elon Musk and others as a non-profit research lab. It wa…</span>

                              <span>It was November 23rd of the year 1963 that Doctor Who first premiered on the BBC. And the many years since then have wrought their changes, writes the BBC:

Events on screen and off have shaped the character&#x27;s personality, their face changing to reflect Britain itself, and every version building on what has gone before. To truly understand Who, you have to know your history... 

[T]he series was originally intended to teach children history as much as thrill them... [T]he Daleks were shouty miniaturised tanks, terrifying to a nation that had lived through World War 2... Scripts by the likes of Douglas Adams (who wrote The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy) leaned into the show&#x27;s inherent strangeness... Interestingly, the new specials and series involve Marvel-owner Disney, who will stream it outside the UK and Ireland, in turn helping boost the budget. 
The article handily summarizes the last 60 years. (&quot;Perhaps the most shocking revelation of [2010 showrunner Steven Moffat&#x27;s] tenure was a hitherto unseen, past version of the Doctor, played by John Hurt. Other writers would take this idea and run with it...&quot;) The article ends with the words, &quot;Only time will tell.&quot; 


And elsewhere another BBC article notes that today &quot;the TARDIS is set to return to BBC One and iPlayer.&quot;
With David Tennant as the Fourteenth Doctor and Catherine Tate reprising her role as Donna Noble the popular duo will make their spectacular return to mark the show&#x27;s 60th anniversary with three special episodes running each Saturday from the 25th November... 

Neil Patrick Harris as the Toymaker [is] set to cause all kinds of mayhem. It&#x27;s going to be an unmissable cosmic adventure, all before Ncuti Gatwa gets the keys to the TARDIS over the festive season. 
Thanks to Alain Williams (Slashdot reader #2,972) for sharing the article.

                              <span>America celebrates &quot;Small Business Saturday&quot; today with special celebrations everywhere from Houston, Texas to Buffalo, New York 
NBC News reports:
Sandwiched between Black Friday and Cyber Monday — historically the biggest and busiest retail days of the year — there&#x27;s another standout shopping event: Small Business Saturday. Started by American Express in 2010 and co-sponsored by the U.S. Small Business Administration since 2011, Small Business Saturday aims to create awareness about the impact shoppers have when they buy &quot;small&quot; year round, whether they physically visit stores or shop online. 

This year, 85% of consumers say they&#x27;re likely to shop &quot;small&quot; during the holiday season, according to the American Express 2023 Shop Small Impact Study. That represents a multibillion dollar opportunity — consumers are expected to spend an estimated $125 billion at small businesses this holiday season, up 42% from $88 billion in 2022, as reported by Intuit QuickBooks. 

Like CBS News, NBC has compiled its list of small businesses that can ship their products to you — and suggests leaving positive reviews online for your favorite small businesses. (&quot;Amazon, for example, now adds badges to product pages on its site if items are sold by small businesses.&quot;)
They also recommend interacting with your favorite small businesses on social media — while &quot;the American Express small-business map allows you to input your zip code so it can recommend local shops in your area and beyond. Google also has a &#x27;small business&#x27; filter on desktop and mobile, and one for Google Maps on mobile.&quot; 

The UK&#x27;s &quot;Small Business Saturday&quot; will happen next week, on the first Saturday in December.

The development team of the Budgie desktop is changing course and will work with the Xfce developers toward Budgie&#x27;s Wayland future... 

While Enlightenment does have some Wayland support, in the project&#x27;s own words this is &quot;still considered experimental and not for regular end users.&quot; Mohammed told us... &quot;Progress though towards a full implementation currently doesn&#x27;t fit into the deemed urgent nature to move to Wayland (Red Hat dropping further X11 development, and questions as to any organisation stepping up, etc.)&quot; 

So, instead, Budgie is exploring different ways to build a Wayland-only environment. For now, as we mentioned when looking at Ubuntu&#x27;s 23.10 release, there&#x27;s a new windowing library, Magpie. Magpie 0.9 is what the project describes as &quot;a soft-fork of GNOME&#x27;s mutter at version 43&quot; — the term soft fork meaning it&#x27;s a temporary means to an end, rather than intended to form an on-going independent continuation. 

For the future, though, Mohammed told us... &quot;[T]he Budgie team has been evaluating options to move forward. XFCE are doing some really great work in this area with libxfce4windowing — a compatibility layer bridging Wayland and X11, allowing the move in a logical direction without needing a big-bang approach. To date, most of the current codebase has already been reworked and is ready for a Wayland-only approach without impacting further development and enhancements.&quot; 
Mohammed later told the Register, &quot;It makes sense for the more dynamic smaller projects to work together where there are shared aims.&quot;

They created a new social network where users can perform only one action: posting the word &quot;yowza.&quot; 

Then announced it on their official social media accounts on Instagram, Facebook, and X... 
Regardless of what words you type into the window, they&#x27;re replaced with the word yowza. &quot;For just $0.99, you&#x27;ll get an exclusive black check by your name,&quot; reads an announcement on the site, &quot;and the ability to post a new word: awooga.&quot; 

It&#x27;s a magical land where &quot;yowfluencers&quot; keep &quot;reyowzaing&quot; the &quot;yowzas&quot; of other users. And there&#x27;s also a tab for trending hashtags. (Although, yes, they all seem to be &quot;yowza&quot;.) But they&#x27;ve already gotten a …</span>

                              <span>America passed a climate bill in August of 2022 with incentives to build wind and solar energy in regions that historically relied on fossil fuels. And sure enough, since then &quot;a disproportionate amount of wind, solar, battery and manufacturing investment is going to areas that used to host fossil fuel plants,&quot; reports the Washington Post. 

 They cite a new analysis of investment trends from independent research firm Rhodium Group and MIT&#x27;s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research:

In Carbon County, Wyo. — a county named for its coal deposits — a power company is building hundreds of wind turbines. In Mingo County, W.Va., where many small towns were once coal towns, the Adams Fork Energy plant will sit on a former coal mining site and produce low-carbon ammonia... While commun…</span>

                              <span>&quot;Every car we were driving with was heading that direction...&quot; Shelby Easler says in a TikTok video, &quot;so we assumed this was going somewhere...&quot; 


But SFGate reports that instead of a handy &quot;alternate route,&quot; Google Maps was leading her and her two passengers &quot;far off the major highway and into Nevada&#x27;s fierce deserts on an off-roading trail.&quot;
Easler&#x27;s car were not the only bushwackers. In Shelby&#x27;s viral TikTok, a trail of cars closely follows behind them. &quot;The first driver that turned around talked to us to tell us that the road gets washed out the higher into the mountain you get, and we have to turn around since the path leads nowhere. He was in a huge truck and was just driving straight through the bushes and shrubs to let people know to turn around,&quot; Easler said. 
1.5 million people have viewed Easler&#x27;s earlier footage of their road to nowhere. The off-roading trail was apparently only wide enough for traffic in one direction, and attempting to return in that other direction, &quot;We were driving over bushes and rocks and alot of the cars couldn&#x27;t even make it,&quot; Easler says in the second video. &quot;Which is kind of why our car broke down.&quot; 

They told SFGate that ultimately &quot;We had to leave the car in Vegas, and it got towed to the service center of a dealership. They said the rear, right tire was coming off, and the alignment was messed up too. Low-key a pretty expensive fix.&quot; 

They eventually called the highway patrol to shut down the road that Google Maps was sending people to, because &quot;With every car coming in, every single car was getting trapped.&quot;

                              <span>Regulators in the European Union, China and France have asked for information on Nvidia&#x27;s graphic cards, with more requests expected in the future, the U.S. chip giant said in a regulatory filing. From a report: Nvidia is the world&#x27;s largest maker of chips used both for artificial intelligence and for computer graphics. Demand for its chips jumped following the release of the generative AI application ChatGPT late last year. The California-based company has a market share of around 80% via its chips and other hardware and its powerful software that runs them. 

Its graphics cards are high-performance devices that enable powerful graphics rendering and processing for use in video editing, video gaming and other complex computing operations. The company said this has attracted regulatory interest around the world. &quot;For example, the French Competition Authority collected information from us regarding our business and competition in the graphics card and cloud service provider market as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets,&quot; Nvidia said in a regulatory filing dated Nov. 21.

                              <span>FFmpeg 6.1&#x27;s codename is a tribute to the great 19th century mathematician Oliver Heaviside. This version includes support for multi-threaded hardware-accelerated video decoding of H.264, HEVC, and AV1 video using the cross-platform Vulkan API, the next-gen replacement for OpenGL, which was added to the codebase in May. The Register adds: The pace of development of FFmpeg has been speeding up slightly in recent years, given that it took 13 years to get to version 2.0. We can&#x27;t help but wonder if that&#x27;s connected with the departure of the former project lead in 2015. The developers are planning to release version 7.0 in about February next year. Even so, the &quot;Heaviside&quot; release, which has been refactored to support even more formats and introduce new methods for faster performance or reduced processor utilization, is smaller than previous releases.

                              <span>Brazil has signed onto an agreement to triple renewable energy globally by 2030 and shift away from using coal, the country&#x27;s Foreign Ministry said on Friday, joining a prospective deal backed by the European Union, U.S. and United Arab Emirates. From a report: South America&#x27;s largest country is now one of roughly 100 countries that have signed onto the deal, according to a European official familiar with the matter. Sources told Reuters earlier this month the aim is for the deal to be officially adopted by leaders attending the United Nation&#x27;s COP28 climate negotiations that begins next week in Dubai. 

Brazil&#x27;s embassy in Abu Dhabi said in a letter to the United Arab Emirates&#x27; Foreign Ministry that it would join the deal titled the &quot;Global Renewables and Energy Efficiency Targets Pledge.&quot; A spokesperson for Brazil&#x27;s Foreign Ministry confirmed the country has decided to join the pact. Brazil is already a major player in renewable energy. More than 80% of the country&#x27;s electricity comes from renewable sources, led by hydropower with solar and wind energy expanding rapidly.

                              <span>TorrentFreak: File-sharing and hosting giant Uloz has announced a radical change to its business model. The Czech site has been under fire for some time and was recently branded a &#x27;notorious market&#x27; by the MPA. However, Uloz says that an imminent ban on file-sharing in favor of a private, cloud-based storage model, is due to the strict conditions imposed by the EU&#x27;s Digital Services Act.

                              <span>No one is a prophet in their own land, including European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, who admitted on Friday that her son lost &quot;almost all&quot; of his investments in crypto assets, despite copious warnings. From a report: Lagarde has long railed against cryptocurrencies, calling them speculative, worthless and a tool often used by criminals for illicit activity. &quot;He ignored me royally, which is his privilege,&quot; Lagarde told a town hall with students in Frankfurt. &quot;And he lost almost all the money that he had invested.&quot; 

&quot;It wasn&#x27;t a lot but he lost it all, he lost about 60% of it,&quot; Lagarde added. &quot;So when I then had another talk with him about it, he reluctantly accepted that I was right.&quot; The ECB chief has two sons in their mid-30s but did not say which one she was referring to. The ECB has called for global regulation of crypto assets both to protect consumers who are unaware of the risk and to close a loophole that can be used to channel funding to terrorists or lets criminals launder cash.

                              <span>Russia President Vladimir Putin on Friday warned that the West should not be allowed to develop a monopoly in the sphere of AI, and said that a much more ambitious Russian strategy for the development of AI would be approved shortly. From a report: China and the United States are leading the development of AI, which many researchers and global leaders think will transform the world and revolutionise society in a way similar to the introduction of computers in the 20th century. Moscow has ambitions to be an AI power too, but its efforts have been set back due to the war in Ukraine which prompted many talented specialists to leave Russia and triggered Western sanctions that have hindered the country&#x27;s high-tech imports. 

Speaking to an AI conference in Moscow beside Sberbank CEO German Gref, Putin said that trying to ban AI was impossible despite the sometimes troubling ethical and social consequences of new technologies. &quot;You cannot ban something - if we ban it then it will develop somewhere else and we will fall behind,&quot; Putin said of AI, though he said ethical questions should be resolved with reference to &quot;traditional&quot; Russian culture. Putin cautioned that some Western online search systems and generative models ignored or even cancelled Russian language and culture. Such Western algorithms, he said, essentially thought Russia did not exist. &quot;Of course, the monopoly and domination of such systems, such alien systems is unacceptable and dangerous,&quot; he said.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Earlier this year, the National Supercomputing Center in Wuxi (an entity blacklisted in the U.S.) launched its new supercomputer based on the enhanced China-designed Sunway SW26010 Pro processors with 384 cores. Sunway&#x27;s SW26010 Pro CPU not only packs more cores than its non-Pro SW26010 predecessor, but it more than quadrupled FP64 compute throughput due to microarchitectural and system architecture improvements, according to Chips and Cheese. However, while the manycore CPU is good on paper, it has several performance bottlenecks. 

The first details of the manycore Sunway SW26010 Pro CPU and supercomputers that use it emerged back in 2021. Now, the company has showcased actual processors and disclosed more details about their architecture and design, which represent a significant leap in performance, recently at SC23. The new CPU is expected to enable China to build high-performance supercomputers based entirely on domestically developed processors. Each Sunway SW26010 Pro has a maximum FP64 throughput of 13.8 TFLOPS, which is massive. For comparison, AMD&#x27;s 96-core EPYC 9654 has a peak FP64 performance of around 5.4 TFLOPS. 

The SW26010 Pro is an evolution of the original SW26010, so it maintains the foundational architecture of its predecessor but introduces several key enhancements. The new SW26010 Pro processor is based on an all-new proprietary 64-bit RISC architecture and packs six core groups (CG) and a protocol processing unit (PPU). Each CG integrates 64 2-wide compute processing elements (CPEs) featuring a 512-bit vector engine as well as 256 KB of fast local store (scratchpad cache) for data and 16 KB for instructions; one management processing element (MPE), which is a superscalar out-of-order core with a vector engine, 32 KB/32 KB L1 instruction/data cache, 256 KB L2 cache; and a 128-bit DDR4-3200 memory interface.

                              <span>Chinese health authorities have provided the requested data on an increase in respiratory illnesses and reported clusters of pneumonia in children, and have not detected any unusual or novel pathogens, the World Health Organization (WHO) said. From a report: The WHO had asked China for more information on Wednesday after groups including the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases reported clusters of undiagnosed pneumonia in children in north China. As per the rule, China responded to the WHO within 24 hours. The WHO had sought epidemiologic and clinical information as well as laboratory results through the International Health Regulations mechanism. 

Epidemiologists have warned that as, China heads into its first winter since the lifting of zero-Covid restrictions, natural levels of immunity to respiratory viruses may be lower than normal, leading to an increase in infections. Several countries, including the US and the UK, experienced large waves of respiratory viral infections in the first winter after Covid restrictions were lifted as people had lower natural levels of immunity. For young children, lockdowns delayed the age at which they were first exposed to common bugs.

                              <span>Nvidia has swung from fourth to first place in an assessment of chip industry revenue published today. From a report: Taipei-based financial analyst Dan Nystedt noted that the green team took the revenue crown from contract chip-making titan TSMC as Q3 financials came into view. Those keeping an eye on the world of investing and finance will have seen our report about Nvidia&#x27;s earnings explosion, evidenced by the firm&#x27;s publishing of its Q3 FY23 results. 

Nvidia charted an amazing performance, with a headlining $18.12 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 206% year-over-year (YoY). The firm&#x27;s profits were also through the roof, and Nystedt posted a graph showing Nvidia elbowed past its chip industry rivals by this metric in Q3 2023, too. Nvidia&#x27;s advance is supported by multiple highly successful operating segments, which have provided a multiplicative effect on its revenue and income. Again, we saw clear evidence of a seismic shift in revenue, with the latest set of financials shared with investors earlier this week.

                              <span>The world&#x27;s biggest iceberg is on the move after more than 30 years being stuck to the ocean floor. From a report: The iceberg, called A23a, split from the Antarctic coastline in 1986. But it swiftly grounded in the Weddell Sea, becoming, essentially, an ice island. At almost 4,000 sq km (1,500 sq miles) in area, it&#x27;s more than twice the size of Greater London. The past year has seen it drifting at speed, and the berg is now about to spill beyond Antarctic waters. A23a is a true colossus, and it&#x27;s not just its width that impresses. 

This slab of ice is some 400m (1,312 ft) thick. For comparison, the London Shard, the tallest skyscraper in Europe, is a mere 310m tall. At the time, it was hosting a Soviet research station, which just illustrates how long ago its calving occurred. Moscow despatched an expedition to remove equipment from the Druzhnaya 1 base, fearing it would be lost. But the tabular berg didn&#x27;t move far from the coast before its deep keel anchored it rigidly to the Weddell&#x27;s bottom-muds. 

So, why, after almost 40 years, is A23a on the move now?

&quot;I asked a couple of colleagues about this, wondering if there was any possible change in shelf water temperatures that might have provoked it, but the consensus is the time had just come,&quot; said Dr Andrew Fleming, a remote sensing expert from the British Antarctic Survey. &quot;It was grounded since 1986 but eventually it was going to decrease (in size) sufficiently to lose grip and start moving. I spotted first movement back in 2020.&quot; A23a has put on a spurt in recent months, driven by winds and currents, and is now passing the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.

                              <span>AI models can find patterns and make predictions, but their reasoning is often inscrutable. This &quot;black box&quot; issue makes AI less reliable and less scientifically useful. However, a team led by Dion Hafner (a computer scientist at the University of Copenhagen) devised a clever neural network to predict rogue waves. By restricting inputs to meaningful wave measurements and tracing how they flowed through the network, the team extracted a simple five-part equation encapsulating the AI&#x27;s logic. Economist adds: To generate a human-comprehensible equation, the researchers used a method inspired by natural selection in biology. They told a separate algorithm to come up with a slew of different equations using those five variables, with the aim of matching the neural network&#x27;s output as closely as possible. The best equations were mixed and combined, and the process was repeated. The result, eventually, was an equation that was simple and almost as accurate as the neural network. Both predicted rogue waves better than existing models. 

The first part of the equation rediscovered a bit of existing theory: it is an approximation of a well-known equation in wave dynamics. Other parts included some terms that the researchers suspected might be involved in rogue-wave formation but are not in standard models. There were some puzzlers, too: the final bit of the equation includes a term that is inversely proportional to how spread out the energy of the waves is. Current human theories include a second variable that the machine did not replicate. One explanation is that the network was not trained on a wide enough selection of examples. Another is that the machine is right, and the second variable is not actually necessary.

                              <span>At a time when some are calling for a pause on the development of generative AI, Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA, has an argument for accelerating the work: AI advances are going to provide tools to better understand the technology and to make it safer, Huang said in a discussion with Goldman Sachs Asset Management. From a report: &quot;We need to accelerate the development of AI as fast as possible, and the reason for that is because safety requires technology,&quot; Huang said in an interview at The Forum with Sung Cho, co-head of Tech Investing for Fundamental Equity in GSAM. 

Consider how much safer today&#x27;s passenger cars are compared with those of earlier generations, Huang suggested, because the technology has advanced. He cited as an example how OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT uses reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to create guardrails that make its responses more relevant, accurate, and appropriate. 

The RLHF is itself an AI model that sits around the core AI model. Huang lists examples of other AI technologies that hold promise for making the models safer and more effective. These range from retrieval augmented generation, in which the model gets information from a defined knowledge base or set of documents, to physics-informed reinforcement learning, which grounds the model in physical principles and constraints. &quot;We need a bunch more technology like that,&quot; Huang said.

                              <span>Dirty air killed more than half a million people in the EU in 2021, estimates show, and about half of the deaths could have been avoided by cutting pollution to the limits recommended by doctors. From a report: The researchers from the European Environment Agency attributed 253,000 early deaths to concentrations of fine particulates known as PM2.5 that breached the World Health Organization&#x27;s maximum guideline limits of 5ug/m3. A further 52,000 deaths came from excessive levels of nitrogen dioxide and 22,000 deaths from short-term exposure to excessive levels of ozone. 

&quot;The figures released today by the EEA remind us that air pollution is still the number one environmental health problem in the EU,&quot; said Virginijus Sinkevicius, the EU&#x27;s environment commissioner. Doctors say air pollution is one of the biggest killers in the world but death tolls will drop quickly if countries clean up their economies. Between 2005 and 2021, the number of deaths from PM2.5 in the EU fell 41%, and the EU aims to reach 55% by the end of the decade. The WHO, which tightened its air quality guidelines in 2021, warns that no level of air pollution can be considered safe but has set upper limits for certain pollutants. The European parliament voted in September to align the EU&#x27;s air quality rules with the WHO&#x27;s but decided to delay doing so until 2035.

From a report: The research, published Thursday in the journal Science, linked coal pollution to 460,000 deaths among Medicare recipients aged 65 and older between 1999 and 2020. Yet the study also found that during that period the shuttering of coal plants in the United State, coupled with the installation of scrubbers in the smokestacks to &quot;clean&quot; coal exhaust, has had salubrious effects. Deaths attributable to coal plant emissions among Medicare recipients dropped from about 50,000 a year in 1999 to 1,600 in 2020, a decrease of more than 95 percent, the researchers found. 

&quot;Things were bad, it was terrible,&quot; Lucas Henneman, the study&#x27;s lead author, and an assistant professor in environmental engineering at George Mason University, said in an interview. &quot;We made progress, and that&#x27;s really good.&quot; Researchers from six universities collected emissions data from 480 coal power plants between 1999 and 2020. They used atmospheric modeling to track how sulfur dioxide converted into particulate matter and where it was carried by wind, and then examined millions of Medicare patient deaths by ZIP code. 

Though the researchers could not identify exact causes of death, the statistical model showed that areas with more airborne coal particulates had higher death rates. Some 138 coal plants each contributed to at least 1,000 excess deaths, and 10 plants were linked to more than 5,000 deaths apiece, the researchers found. While fine particulate matter, known as P.M. 2.5, is frequently examined for its health risks, the researchers found that inhaling those fine particles from coal exhaust was especially deadly.

                              <span>Nvidia has told customers in China it is delaying the launch of a new AI chip it designed to comply with U.S. export rules until the first quarter of next year, Reuters reported Friday, citing sources familiar with the matter. From the report: The delayed chip is the H20, the most powerful of three China-focused chips Nvidia has developed to comply with fresh U.S. export restrictions, the sources said, and could complicate its efforts to preserve market share in China against local rivals like Huawei. The California-based AI chip giant had been expected to launch the new products as early as Nov. 16, chip industry newsletter SemiAnalysis reported this month. 

However, the H20 launch has now been pushed back until the first quarter of next year, the sources said, with one saying they were advised it could take place in February or March. The sources said they were told that the H20 was being delayed due to issues server manufacturers were having in integrating the chip.

                              <span>The British Library has confirmed that personal data stolen in a cyber-attack has appeared online, apparently for sale to the highest bidder. From a report: The attack was carried out in October by a group known for such criminal activity, said the UK&#x27;s national library, which holds about 14m books and millions of other items. This week, Rhysida, a known ransomware group, claimed it was responsible for the attack. It posted low-resolution images of personal information online, offering stolen data for sale with a starting bid of 20 bitcoins (about $750,000). Rhysida said the data was &quot;exclusive, unique and impressive&quot; and that it would be sold to a single buyer. It set a deadline for bids of 27 November. 

The images appear to show employment contracts and passport information. The library said it was &quot;aware that some data has been leaked, which appears to be from files relating to our internal HR information.&quot; It did not confirm that Rhysida was responsible for the attack, nor that the data offered for sale was information on personnel. Academics and researchers who use the library have been told that disruption to the institution&#x27;s services after the serious ransomware attack was likely to continue for months. This week, the library advised its users to change any logins also used on other sites as a precaution.

                              <span>The office sector&#x27;s credit crunch is intensifying. By one measure, it&#x27;s now worse than during the 2008-09 global financial crisis. From a report: Only one out of every three securitized office mortgages that expired during the first nine months of 2023 was paid off by the end of September, according to Moody&#x27;s Analytics. That is the smallest share for the first nine months of any year since at least 2008 and well below the nadir reached in 2009, when 47% of these loans got paid off. That share is also well below the rate before the pandemic, when more than eight out of every 10 maturing securitized office mortgages were paid back in some years. 

While the numbers cover only office mortgages packaged into bonds -- so-called commercial mortgage-backed securities -- they reflect a broader freeze in the lending market for office buildings. Many office owners can&#x27;t pay back their old loans because they can&#x27;t get new mortgages. Remote work and rising vacancies have hit building profits, making it harder to pay interest. Higher interest rates have pushed debt costs up and building values down. That combination is fueling a rise in defaults. The share of office CMBS loans that are delinquent has tripled over the past year to 5.75%, according to Trepp. It doesn&#x27;t help that many banks no longer issue new office loans and that many insurance companies and debt funds have become more cautious.

                              <span>India is drafting rules to detect and limit the spread of deepfake content and other harmful AI media, a senior lawmaker said Thursday, following reports of proliferation of such content on social media platforms in recent weeks. From a report: Ashwini Vaishnaw, India&#x27;s IT Minister, said the ministry held meetings with all large social media companies, industry body Nasscom and academics earlier in the day and has reached a consensus that a regulation is needed to better combat spread of deepfake videos as well as apps that facilitate their creations. &quot;The companies share our concerns and they understood that it&#x27;s [deepfakes] are not free speech. They understood that it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s very harmful to the society,&quot; he said. &quot;They understood the need for much heavier regulation on this, so we agree that we will start drafting the regulation today itself.&quot; The ministry will be ready with &quot;clear actionable items&quot; on how to combat deepfakes in 10 days.

                              <span>Scientists have detected the most powerful cosmic ray seen in more than three decades. But the exact origin of this turbocharged particle from outer space remains a mystery, with some suggesting that it could have been generated by unknown physics. From a report: The puzzling cosmic ray had an estimated energy of 240 exa-electron volts (EeV; 10^18 volts), making it comparable to the most powerful cosmic ray ever detected, aptly named the Oh-My-God particle, which measured at around 320 EeV when it was discovered in 1991. The findings were published today in Science. 

&quot;It&#x27;s amazing because you have to think of what could produce such high energy,&quot; says Clancy James, an astronomer at Curtin University in Perth, Australia. A cosmic ray, despite its name, is actually a high-energy subatomic particle -- often a proton -- that zips through space at close to the speed of light. In their ultra-high energy form, cosmic rays have energy levels that exceed one EeV, which is around one million times greater than those reached by the most powerful human-made particle accelerators. Cosmic rays with energies of more than 100 EeV are rarely spotted -- fewer than one of these particles arrive on each square kilometre of Earth each century.

                              <span>At 26, nurse Benzor Vidal moved from the Philippines to America for work, but quit his unsafe, understaffed nursing home job after 14 weeks. His employment contract stipulated he could owe $20,000+ in damages if he resigned early. The New York Times Magazine digs deeper: This type of contract provision is known as a &quot;stay or pay&quot; clause, and it used to be common only for certain high-paying roles or in certain specialized industries. For airline pilots and software engineers, for example, it has been a longstanding practice at some companies to require employees to stay at their jobs for a defined period of time in order to recoup costs related to hiring and training. But the line between recouping costs and penalizing workers for leaving can be blurry, and companies have increasingly taken advantage of that ambiguity. Workers&#x27; rights advocates say that, in many cases, stay-or-pay clauses no longer accurately reflect the company&#x27;s costs but instead appear to be inflated financial penalties designed to discourage quitting. 

The use of stay-or-pay clauses has grown rapidly over the past decade, and it has seemingly exploded since the start of the pandemic, as companies try to retain workers in a tight labor market. The clauses have spread far beyond the handful of roles and industries where they originated and are now used by thousands of mid- and low-wage employers -- something that came to light when workers began filing lawsuits challenging the practice. These contract terms have been applied to bank workers, salespeople, dog groomers, police officers, aestheticians, firefighters, mechanics, nurses, federal employees, electricians, roofers, social workers, paramedics, truckers, mortgage brokers, teachers and metal polishers. Legal experts believe stay-or-pay clauses might now be in industries that employ a third of all American workers.

                              <span>Researchers have used the technology behind the AI chatbot ChatGPT to create a fake clinical-trial data set to support an unverified scientific claim. From a report: In a paper published in JAMA Ophthalmology on 9 November, the authors used GPT-4 -- the latest version of the large language model on which ChatGPT runs -- paired with Advanced Data Analysis (ADA), a model that incorporates the programming language Python and can perform statistical analysis and create data visualizations. The AI-generated data compared the outcomes of two surgical procedures and indicated -- wrongly -- that one treatment is better than the other. 

&quot;Our aim was to highlight that, in a few minutes, you can create a data set that is not supported by real original data, and it is also opposite or in the other direction compared to the evidence that are available,&quot; says study co-author Giuseppe Giannaccare, an eye surgeon at the University of Cagliari in Italy. The ability of AI to fabricate convincing data adds to concern among researchers and journal editors about research integrity. &quot;It was one thing that generative AI could be used to generate texts that would not be detectable using plagiarism software, but the capacity to create fake but realistic data sets is a next level of worry,&quot; says Elisabeth Bik, a microbiologist and independent research-integrity consultant in San Francisco, California. &quot;It will make it very easy for any researcher or group of researchers to create fake measurements on non-existent patients, fake answers to questionnaires or to generate a large data set on animal experiments.&quot;

                              <span>The founder of Chipotle is opening a new endeavor called Kernel, a vegetarian fast-casual restaurant that will be operated mostly by robots. Steve Ells is opening at least 15 locations of Kernel, the first by early 2024; the remainder are on track for NYC in the next two years, a spokesperson confirms. From a report: Kernel will serve vegetarian sandwiches, salads, and sides, made in a space that&#x27;s around 1,000 square-feet or smaller. Each location would employ three workers, the Wall Street Journal reported, &quot;rather than the dozen that many fast-casual eateries have working.&quot; The menu pricing will be on par with Chipotle&#x27;s, and, Ells says, the company will pay more and offer better benefits for actual humans working than other chains. 

As you&#x27;d expect from the former CEO of Chipotle -- which had at least five foodborne illness outbreaks between 2015 and 2018, costing the company $25 million per the Justice Department -- &quot;the new system&#x27;s design helps better ensure food safety,&quot; Ells told the Journal. It has taken $10 million in his personal funds to start Kernel, along with $36 million from investors. The company suggests customers may not want much interaction with other people -- and neither do CEOs. &quot;We&#x27;ve taken a lot of human interaction out of the process and left just enough,&quot; he told the Journal. Yet in a 2022 study on the future of dining out conducted by commerce site, PYMNTS, of 2,500 people surveyed, 63 percent of diners believe restaurants are becoming increasingly understaffed, and 39 percent said that they are becoming less personal.

                              <span>Anthony Levandowski, a tech entrepreneur and self-driving car pioneer, said he&#x27;s rebooting his AI church in a renewed attempt at creating a religious movement focused on the worship and understanding of artificial intelligence. From a report: Levandowski&#x27;s so-called Way of the Future was founded in 2015 but shut its doors a few years later. The congregation at the new church, which shares the original&#x27;s name, has &quot;a couple thousand people&quot; coming together to build a spiritual connection between humans and AI, its founder said. 

Levandowski made the remarks during an interview for the latest episode of the Bloomberg Originals series AI IRL, available to stream now. &quot;How does a person in rural America relate to this? What does this mean for their job?&quot; he said. &quot;Way of the Future is a mechanism for them to understand and participate and shape the public discourse as to how we think technology should be built to improve you.&quot; 

The existence of the original church became public in 2017, years before the viral success of ChatGPT brought AI into mainstream consciousness. Levandowski&#x27;s idea raised eyebrows, both because of the church&#x27;s focus on &quot;the realization, acceptance, and worship of a Godhead based on Artificial Intelligence developed through computer hardware and software,&quot; and because of Levandowski himself. At the time, he was at the center of a high-profile legal battle related to the theft of trade secrets, sentenced to 18 months in prison, then pardoned by former President Donald Trump.

                              <span>Ian Hickson, a software engineer at Google who left the company after 18 years, reflects on his time at the firm in a blog post and why he thinks the firm lost its way. He joined in 2005 when its culture genuinely prioritized doing good, but over time he saw that culture erode into one focused on profits over users, he writes. The recent layoffs have damaged trust and morale across the company, he writes. An excerpt from the post: Much of these problems with Google today stem from a lack of visionary leadership from Sundar Pichai, and his clear lack of interest in maintaining the cultural norms of early Google. A symptom of this is the spreading contingent of inept middle management. Take Jeanine Banks, for example, who manages the department that somewhat arbitrarily contains (among other…</span>

                              <span>GameMaker announced that it will be free to use for noncommercial, non-console projects, breaking away from Unity and its massive pricing controversy that saw game developers boycotting the engine. The company is also &quot;eliminating its indie / creator tier monthly subscription fee in favor of a one-time paid licensing fee of $99,&quot; reports The Verge. &quot;Additionally, if you&#x27;re currently enrolled at the indie / creator tier and wish to pay the licensing fee, the subscription fees you&#x27;ve paid will be discounted from the price.&quot; The Verge: Russell Kay, head of GameMaker, said that the changes were a way for the company to express its thanks to users, explaining that, since 2021, GameMaker has seen its user base triple in size. Kay also had some subtle but effective shade for GameMaker&#x27;s competitors. &quot;We have seen other platforms making awkward moves with their pricing and terms, so we thought, what if we did the opposite, something that could actually be good for developers?&quot; Kay wrote in the announcement.
 
Though customers currently enrolled in an enterprise-level subscription will see no changes to their plans, it seems like GameMaker is counting on the pricing update to draw more people to the software. &quot;Our success is measured by the number of people making games!&quot; Kay wrote.

The previously unreported letter and AI algorithm was a key development ahead of the board&#x27;s ouster of Altman, the poster child of generative AI, the two sources said. Before his triumphant return late Tuesday, more than 700 employees had threatened to quit and join backer Microsoft in solidarity with their fired leader.

                              <span>Brian Silvestro reports via Motor1.com: New Jersey announced a new rule set on Wednesday laying out plans to transition sales of light-duty vehicles in the state to 100-percent zero-emission by 2035. According to a statement released by the office of governor Phil Murphy, the law, titled the Advanced Clean Cars II rule, will come into effect starting in 2027, where manufacturers must ensure that zero-emissions vehicles represent 42 percent of sales in the state. That percentage will climb with each year until 2035, when it reaches 100 percent. Currently, EVs represent roughly 12 percent of all new vehicle sales, according to the governor&#x27;s office.
 
The new law will also put more stringent standards in place for traditional ICE-powered vehicles, with the goal of improving air quality in New Jersey communities and high-traffic corridors. While the announcement does not directly mention investment into charging infrastructure, the governor&#x27;s office points out its continued dedication to providing adequate charging locations across the state, claiming it has helped fund the installment of 2,980 charging stations with 5,271 ports at 680 locations. New Jersey is the ninth state to enact a ban on future ICE car sales, joining California, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: Sam Altman may have been asked to leave OpenAI, but his involvement in crypto project Tools for Humanity, which is building Worldcoin, remains uninterrupted, a source close to the project told TechCrunch. Altman has &quot;consistent and valuable&quot; engagement with Tools for Humanity and &quot;that is not expected to change,&quot; the source said. The source added that Altman is still chairman and co-founder of the project, confirming that the information on the project&#x27;s website is up to date.
 
News of Altman&#x27;s ouster sent the Worldcoin token, WLD, plummeting to a low of $1.84 on Saturday, but the token recovered over the weekend and is currently trading on par with previous levels at $2.40, per CoinMarketCap data. Worldcoin raised $115 million in May in a Series C round led by Blockchain Capital. As of March, Altman was on the project&#x27;s board, but was not involved in day-to-day operations. &quot;Proof of personhood is becoming increasingly important in the rapidly advancing age of AI,&quot; The Worldcoin Foundation told TechCrunch late on Monday. The team supporting Worldcoin is still focused on the project&#x27;s mission, &quot;building a more human internet and a more accessible global economy through World ID, a privacy-enhancing way to verify humanness and uniqueness online,&quot; the company said.

                              <span>OpenAI&#x27;s &quot;ChatGPT with voice&quot; feature announced in September is now rolling out to all free users on mobile. Engadget reports: When the company first introduced voice chats, it admitted that the capability to create &quot;realistic synthetic voices from just a few seconds of real speech&quot; presents new risks. It could, for instance, allow bad actors to impersonate public figures or anybody they want. As a result, it decided that ChatGPT&#x27;s voice feature will focus on conversations. It&#x27;s powered by a text-to-speech model that can generate &quot;human-like audio from just text and a few seconds of sample speech.&quot; OpenAI worked with voice actors to create the capability and offers five different voices to choose from.

                              <span>Nvidia&#x27;s fiscal third-quarter results surpassed Wall Street&#x27;s predictions, with revenue growing 206% year over year. However, Nvidia shares are down after the company called for a negative impact in the next quarter due to export restrictions affecting sales in China and other countries. CNBC reports: Nvidia&#x27;s revenue grew 206% year over year during the quarter ending Oct. 29, according to a statement. Net income, at $9.24 billion, or $3.71 per share, was up from $680 million, or 27 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago. The company&#x27;s data center revenue totaled $14.51 billion, up 279% and more than the StreetAccount consensus of $12.97 billion. Half of the data center revenue came from cloud infrastructure providers such as Amazon, and the other from consumer internet entities and large companies, Nvidia said. Healthy uptake came from clouds that specialize in renting out GPUs to clients, Kress said on the call.
 
The gaming segment contributed $2.86 billion, up 81% and higher than the $2.68 billion StreetAccount consensus. With respect to guidance, Nvidia called for $20 billion in revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter. That implies nearly 231% revenue growth. [...] Nvidia faces obstacles, including competition from AMD and lower revenue because of export restrictions that can limit sales of its GPUs in China. But ahead of Tuesday report, some analysts were nevertheless optimistic.

Unknown attackers have been exploiting the zero-days to compromise the devices so they can be infected with Mirai, a potent piece of open source software that makes routers, cameras, and other types of Internet of Things devices part of a …</span>

                              <span>Bard, Google&#x27;s AI chatbot, has steadily been getting more useful after a lackluster introduction. Now the bot&#x27;s YouTube integration is getting a handy upgrade so it can analyze individual videos to surface specific information for you -- like key points or recipe ingredients -- without ever pressing play. From a report: That&#x27;s potentially a hugely useful tool, but could spell more worry about generative AI for creators. To try it out, I turned Bard on a YouTube video I regularly reference for spiritual guidance: America&#x27;s Test Kitchen&#x27;s recipe for an Espresso Martini. Seriously, it&#x27;s really good. I often find myself in my kitchen with half the ingredients in a cocktail shaker trying to remember how much Benedictine I&#x27;m supposed to add, then re-watching the video to find out. But with Bard on the case, all I have to do is type a few prompts and viola -- I have the full list of ingredients and some step-by-step instructions.

                              <span>OLED monitors risk burn-in, especially with static images. Newer models combat this using improved materials, algorithms, efficiencies, features, and heat management. However, long-term data is minimal as quality selection is recent. An unexpected quirk applies to ultrawides: playing 16:9 content creates brighter center areas versus darker sides, quickening OLED degradation. In an extreme test by RTINGS, Samsung ultrawides developed heavy differential wear in just 700 hours. ArsTechnica adds: Even OLED monitors that have already been released can see their capabilities change in a way that could impact burn-in risk. For example, the Odyssey G8 monitor got a firmware update in August that removed the ability to use the Peak Brightness setting in SDR mode. While this is just one specific mode that, again, some users might not use, it&#x27;s worth noting how this could change the amount of wear an OLED monitor could see. RTINGS&#x27; review said that after the firmware update, the monitor&#x27;s max luminance &quot;when displaying a bright highlight in an SDR scene&quot; went from 331 nits to 230 nits. Samsung hasn&#x27;t confirmed the reasons for this change, but such changes highlight how OLED monitor burn-in risk can change from use to use and from update to update, across different products.

                              <span>HP CEO Enrique Lores is betting a sprinkle of AI dust can regenerate the flagging PC market -- and with shipments still in decline across the industry, he can&#x27;t afford to tease Wall Street. From a report: The world&#x27;s second largest seller of desktop computing hardware has reported a 15 percent year-on-year decline in revenue to $53.7 billion for fiscal 2023 ended 31 October. Profit before tax was $2.93 billion versus $4.32 billion in the prior year. 

[...] Orders picked up in recent months. Analyst data indicates the rate of decline is slowing after resellers began clearing inventory they&#x27;d amassed in the latter stage of the pandemic, when the frenzied buying patterns seen in prior years vanished. For Q4, HP reported revenue of $13.8 billion, down 6.5 percent year-on-year. Personal Systems was down 8 percent to $9.4 billion and Printing was down 3 percent to $4.4 billion. Profit before tax was $852 million, better than the $647 million brought in a year earlier, helped by a reduction in structural costs. HP expects business PC refresh cycles to kick in next year, with more corporate customers shifting their estate to Windows 11 -- yet it is the advent of the AI PC that Lores thinks signal better times.

                              <span>It&#x27;s not your imagination: Airlines are piling on more fees and extra charges, driving up the cost of air travel. From a report: Across the industry, revenue from what&#x27;s known as ancillary sales -- fees for selecting seats, checking bags, and buying food, to name a few -- will reach a record $117.9 billion in 2023. That&#x27;s a 7.7% increase from pre-pandemic records, according to a recent study from airline consultancy firm IdeaWorks and B2B car rental company CarTrawler. 

As plane ticket prices have become more competitive, airlines have turned to ancillary sales to boost profits. And where these fees were once largely confined to low-cost carriers, practices like charging customers for seats and checked luggage are now widespread across all airlines. As the IdeaWorks study points out, carriers like British Airways, Air France, and KLM are now even charging fliers to secure &#x27;better&#x27; business class seats. 

It&#x27;s not simply the fees that are raising hackles. It&#x27;s also how they&#x27;re sold online. Due to the time sensitive nature of airfares, as well as the dozens of upgrades and extras offered as you click through the sales process, airline websites can be ripe environments for what&#x27;s known as dark patterns. Coined in 2010 by Harry Brignull, a UX designer with a doctorate in cognitive science, dark patterns are design strategies used to trick consumers during their purchasing experience and guide them to decisions they would not make otherwise. Airlines employ a range of tactics on their websites, ranging from manipulation to deception, Bringull says. &quot;People need to be aware of their tactics if we want to see changes in the way they operate.&quot;

                              <span>Australia will give cyber health checks for small businesses, increase cyber law enforcement funding and introduce mandatory reporting of ransomware attacks under a security overhaul announced on Wednesday after a spate of attacks. From a report: The federal government said it will also subject telecommunications firms to tougher cyber reporting rules which apply to critical infrastructure, seek migrants to build up the cyber security workforce and set limits on inter-agency data sharing to encourage people to report incidents. The A$587 million ($382 million) plan shows the centre-left Labor government trying to get on the front foot after a year in which nearly half the country&#x27;s 26 million population had personal information stolen in just two data breaches at companies, while a cyber attack at its biggest port operator this month brought supply chains to a standstill.

                              <span>Large earthquakes are always followed by aftershocks -- a series of smaller but still potentially damaging quakes produced as the ground readjusts. But how long does it take for the aftershocks to die out? A new study suggests some areas can experience aftershocks decades or even centuries after the original earthquake. From a report: In earthquake-prone areas it is hard to tell the difference between aftershocks and ordinary background seismicity. But recognising aftershocks is an important part of assessing a region&#x27;s disaster risk. To understand how long aftershocks can persist, researchers turned to the stable continental interior of North America, where earthquakes are uncommon. Using statistical analysis they assessed the timing and clustering of quakes that followed three large magnitude 6.5 to 8 historical earthquakes: one near south-east Quebec in Canada in 1663; a trio of quakes around the Missouri-Kentucky border from 1811 to 1812; and an earthquake in Charleston in South Carolina in 1886. Their results, published in Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth, suggest that the Quebec quake in 1663 has likely shaken itself out, but to their surprise nearly a third of modern quakes in the Missouri-Kentucky area were most likely to be aftershocks from the 1811-12 event, and about 16% of recent quakes in the Charleston region are probably aftershocks from the 1886 quake.

                              <span>In 2018, director Carl Rinsch was courted by multiple studios due to high demand for content, despite his first film being a flop. He pitched a sci-fi series about artificial humans providing aid worldwide, but who are eventually rejected by humans. After a bidding war, Netflix signed an $61 million deal for the unnamed project, giving Rinsch final cut privilege and rights to future seasons - highly unusual moves. 

Soon after, Rinsch&#x27;s behavior grew concerning as he claimed to discover COVID&#x27;s transmission and predict lightning, and he gambled away millions from Netflix on stocks and crypto, The New York Times reported Wednesday. His wife Gabriela Roses worried about his amphetamine use and tried intervening, but he refused rehab. In 2020, Netflix gave Rinsch another $11 million, which he also lost much of on risky bets. 

By mid-2021, Roses informed Netflix executives about Rinsch&#x27;s state and filed for divorce, the Times reported. Netflix consulted police about Rinsch&#x27;s behavior before deciding to stop funding the project in March 2021, though he could shop it elsewhere. Rinsch made $27 million on crypto bets, which he used to buy Rolls-Royces and luxury items. He claims Netflix owes him $14 million more, while Netflix says he never delivered the project milestones to receive additional funding. The confidential arbitration case over the contract dispute concluded this month.

                              <span>As if homesickness, wasting muscles, thinner bones, an elevated cancer risk, the inescapable company of overachievers and the prospect of death in the endless vacuum of space were not enough to contend with, male astronauts may return from deep space prone to erectile dysfunction, scientists say. From a report: In what is claimed to be the first study to assess the impact of galactic radiation and weightlessness on male sexual health, Nasa-funded researchers found that galactic cosmic rays, and to a lesser extent microgravity, can impair the function of erectile tissues, with effects lasting potentially for decades. Raising their concerns in a report on Wednesday, the US researchers said they had identified &quot;a new health risk to consider with deep space exploration.&quot; They called for the sexual health of astronauts to be closely monitored on their return from future deep space missions, noting that certain antioxidants may help to counteract the ill-effects by blocking harmful biological processes. 

&quot;While the negative impacts of galactic cosmic radiation were long-lasting, functional improvements induced by acutely targeting the redox and nitric oxide pathways in the tissues suggest that the erectile dysfunction may be treatable,&quot; said Dr Justin La Favor, an expert in neurovascular dysfunction at Florida State University and a senior author on the study. The warning comes amid a renewed focus on deep space missions, with Nasa and other major space agencies preparing for long-term expeditions to the moon and more ambitious voyages to Mars. Nasa&#x27;s Artemis programme aspires to send astronauts to the moon as early as next year, with crewed missions to Mars tentatively lined up for as early as 2040.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Hello fingerprint authentication has been bypassed on laptops from Dell, Lenovo, and even Microsoft. From a report: Security researchers at Blackwing Intelligence have discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the top three fingerprint sensors that are embedded into laptops and used widely by businesses to secure laptops with Windows Hello fingerprint authentication. Microsoft&#x27;s Offensive Research and Security Engineering (MORSE) asked Blackwing Intelligence to evaluate the security of fingerprint sensors, and the researchers provided their findings in a presentation at Microsoft&#x27;s BlueHat conference in October. 

The team identified popular fingerprint sensors from Goodix, Synaptics, and ELAN as targets for their research, with a newly-published blog post detailing the in-depth process of building a USB device that can perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. Such an attack could provide access to a stolen laptop, or even an &quot;evil maid&quot; attack on an unattended device. A Dell Inspiron 15, Lenovo ThinkPad T14, and Microsoft Surface Pro X all fell victim to fingerprint reader attacks, allowing the researchers to bypass the Windows Hello protection as long as someone was previously using fingerprint authentication on a device. Blackwing Intelligence researchers reverse engineered both software and hardware, and discovered cryptographic implementation flaws in a custom TLS on the Synaptics sensor. The complicated process to bypass Windows Hello also involved decoding and reimplementing proprietary protocols.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: A group of Russian-state hackers known for almost exclusively targeting Ukranian entities has branched out in recent months either accidentally or purposely by allowing USB-based espionage malware to infect a variety of organizations in other countries. The group -- known by many names, including Gamaredon, Primitive Bear, ACTINIUM, Armageddon, and Shuckworm -- has been active since at least 2014 and has been attributed to Russia&#x27;s Federal Security Service by the Security Service of Ukraine. Most Kremlin-backed groups take pains to fly under the radar; Gamaredon doesn&#x27;t care to. Its espionage-motivated campaigns targeting large numbers of Ukrainian organizations are easy to detect and tie back to the Russian government. The campaigns t…</span>

                              <span>Rahul Rao reports via Space.com: On Nov. 14, NASA picked up a laser signal fired from an instrument that launched with the Psyche spacecraft, which is currently more than 10 million miles (16 million kilometers) from Earth and heading toward a mysterious metal asteroid. (The spacecraft is at more than 40 times the average distance of Earth&#x27;s moon, and still voyaging afar.) The moment marked the first successful test of NASA&#x27;s Deep Space Optical Communications (DSOC) system, a next-generation comms link that sends information not by radio waves but instead by laser light. It&#x27;s part of a series of tests NASA is doing to speed up communications in deep space, on different missions. &quot;Achieving first light is a tremendous achievement. The ground systems successfully detected the deep space laser photons from DSOC,&quot; Abi Biswas, the system&#x27;s project technologist at NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Southern California, said in an agency statement.
 
&quot;And we were also able to send some data, meaning we were able to exchange &#x27;bits of light&#x27; from and to deep space,&quot; Biswas added.

                              <span>Laura Snapes reports via The Guardian: Spotify is to phase out its service in Uruguay after the passing of a new music copyright bill requiring &quot;fair and equitable remuneration&quot; for authors, composers, performers, directors and screenwriters. In October, the country&#x27;s parliament voted on a budget bill that included two new articles: per article 284, social networks and the internet are to be added &quot;as formats for which, if a song is reproduced, the performer is entitled to financial remuneration&quot; -- namely if a link to a song is shared online. Article 285 will put into copyright law the &quot;right to a fair and equitable remuneration&quot; for all &quot;agreements entered into by authors, composers, performers, directors and screenwriters with respect to their faculty of public communication and making available to the public of phonograms and audiovisual recordings.&quot;
 
In response, Spotify said in a statement on November 20 that without changes to the 2023 Rendicion de Cuentas law, the streaming platform &quot;will, unfortunately, begin to phase out its service in Uruguay effective January 1, 2024&quot; and cease trading in the market in February 2024. The Swedish company seeks confirmation on whether additional costs to be paid to musicians are the responsibility of rights holders or the streaming platforms, arguing that the latter means that it would be required &quot;to pay twice for the same music,&quot; Music Business Worldwide reports. The statement continued: &quot;Spotify already pays nearly 70% of every dollar it generates from music to the record labels and publishers that own the rights for music, and represent and pay artists and songwriters. Any additional payments would make our business untenable.&quot; The platform claimed that it had contributed to a 20% growth in Uruguay&#x27;s music industry in 2022. That year, the South American nation was the 53rd largest market for music.

                              <span>Connor Jones reports via The Register: The government of Canada has confirmed its data was accessed after two of its third-party service providers were attacked. The third parties both provided relocation services for public sector workers and the government is currently analyzing a &quot;significant volume of data&quot; which could date back to 1999. No formal conclusions have yet been made about the number of workers impacted due to the large-scale task of analyzing the relevant data. However, the servers impacted by the breach held data related to current and former Canadian government staff, members of the Canadian armed forces, and Royal Canadian Mounted Police workers -- aka Mounties.
 
&quot;At this time, given the significant volume of data being assessed, we cannot yet identify specific individuals impacted; however, preliminary information indicates that breached information could belong to anyone who has used relocation services as early as 1999 and may include any personal and financial information that employees provided to the companies,&quot; a government statement read. Those who think they may be affected are advised to update any login details that may be similar to those used to access BGRS or Sirva&#x27;s systems. Enabling MFA across all accounts that are used for online transactions is also advised, as is the manual monitoring of personal accounts for any potential malicious activity. Work is currently being carried out to identify and address any vulnerabilities that may have led to the incident, according to the statement.

                              <span>According to Polish news channel TVN24, a secret cryptomining rig was found under the floors of a Polish court, stealing thousands of Polish Zlotys worth of energy per month (the equivalent of roughly $250 per 1,000 Zlotys). &quot;It&#x27;s currently unknown how long the rig was running because the illegal operation went undetected, partly because the computers used were connected to the Internet through their own modems rather than through the court&#x27;s network,&quot; reports Ars Technica. From the report: While no one has been charged yet with any crimes, the court seemingly has suspects. Within two weeks of finding the rig, the court terminated a contract with a company responsible for IT maintenance in the building, TVN24 reported. Before the contract ended, the company fired two employees that it said were responsible for maintenance in the parts of the building where the cryptomine was hidden. Poland&#x27;s top law enforcement officials, the Internal Security Agency, have been called in to investigate. The Warsaw District Prosecutor&#x27;s Office has hired IT experts to help determine exactly how much electricity was stolen from Poland&#x27;s Supreme Administrative Court in Warsaw, TVN24 reported.
 
The Supreme Administrative Court is the last resort for sensitive business and tax disputes, but no records seem to have been compromised. Judge Sylwester Marciniak -- the chairman of the Judicial Information Department of the Supreme Administrative Court -- told TVN24 that the discovery of the cryptomine &quot;did not result in any threat to the security of data stored&quot; in the court.

                              <span>Winston Cho writes via The Hollywood Reporter: A federal judge has dismissed most of Sarah Silverman&#x27;s lawsuit against Meta over the unauthorized use of authors&#x27; copyrighted books to train its generative artificial intelligence model, marking the second ruling from a court siding with AI firms on novel intellectual property questions presented in the legal battle. U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria on Monday offered a full-throated denial of one of the authors&#x27; core theories that Meta&#x27;s AI system is itself an infringing derivative work made possible only by information extracted from copyrighted material. &quot;This is nonsensical,&quot; he wrote in the order. &quot;There is no way to understand the LLaMA models themselves as a recasting or adaptation of any of the plaintiffs&#x27; books.&quot;
 
Another of Silverman&#x27;s arguments that every result produced by Meta&#x27;s AI tools constitutes copyright infringement was dismissed because she didn&#x27;t offer evidence that any of the outputs &quot;could be understood as recasting, transforming, or adapting the plaintiffs&#x27; books.&quot; Chhabria gave her lawyers a chance to replead the claim, along with five others that weren&#x27;t allowed to advance. Notably, Meta didn&#x27;t move to dismiss the allegation that the copying of books for purposes of training its AI model rises to the level of copyright infringement. In July, Silverman and two authors filed a class action lawsuit against Meta and OpenAI for allegedly using their content without permission to train AI language models.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: OpenAI&#x27;s board of directors is reportedly in talks with Sam Altman, ex-Y Combinator president and an OpenAI co-founder, to return to OpenAI as CEO as soon as this week. That&#x27;s according to Bloomberg, which in a brief this morning -- citing sources close to the matter -- said that discussions are happening between Quora CEO Adam D&#x27;Angelo, one current member of the OpenAI board, and Altman -- and possibly other board members as well. Per Bloomberg, the board member (or members) and Altman are discussing a number of possible scenarios that could play out. In one, Altman would return as a director on a transitional board. In another -- or perhaps the same -- former Salesforce Inc. co-CEO Bret Taylor could serve as a director on a new board. …</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: In recent years, lots of American companies have gotten behind a potential climate solution called carbon capture and storage, and the Biden administration has backed it with billions of dollars in tax incentives and direct investments. The idea is to trap planet-heating carbon dioxide from the smokestacks of factories and power plants and transport it to sites where it is injected underground and stored. But the idea is controversial, in large part because the captured carbon dioxide would be shipped to storage sites via thousands of miles of new pipelines. Communities nationwide are pushing back against these pipeline projects and underground sites, arguing they don&#x27;t want the pollution running through their land. 

Now the U.S. Forest Service is proposing to change a rule to allow storing this carbon dioxide pollution under the country&#x27;s national forests and grasslands. &quot;Authorizing carbon capture and storage on NFS lands would support the Administration&#x27;s goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent below the 2005 levels by 2030,&quot; the proposed rule change says. But environmental groups and researchers have concerns. Carbon dioxide pollution will still need to be transported to the forests via industrial pipeline for storage, says June Sekera, a research fellow with Boston University. &quot;To get the CO2 to the injection site in the midst of our national forest, they&#x27;ve got to build huge pipelines,&quot; Sekera says. &quot;All this huge industrial infrastructure that&#x27;s going to go right through.&quot; Sekera says building those CO2 pipelines may require clearing a lot of trees.

                              <span>The chief executive of Binance, the largest global cryptocurrency exchange, plans to step down and plead guilty to violating criminal U.S. anti-money laundering requirements, in a deal that may preserve the company&#x27;s ability to continue operating, WSJ reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. From the report: Changpeng Zhao is scheduled to appear in Seattle federal court Tuesday afternoon and enter his plea, the people said. Binance, which Zhao owns, will also plead guilty to a criminal charge and agree to pay fines totaling $4.3 billion, which includes amounts to settle civil allegations made by regulators, the people said. The deal would end long-running investigations of Binance. [...] The deal would allow Zhao to retain his majority ownership of Binance, although he won&#x27;t be able to have an executive role at the company. He would face sentencing at a later date.

                              <span>An anonymous reader writes: Christopher Nolan made headlines earlier this month when he took a playful jab at streaming platforms while discussing the upcoming home release of &quot;Oppenheimer.&quot; The atomic bomb drama, which grossed a staggering $950 million in theaters worldwide, is hitting Blu-ray and other digital platforms this month. Nolan said at a recent &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; screening that it&#x27;s important to own the film on Blu-ray so that &quot;no evil streaming service can come steal it from you.&quot; He told The Washington Post in a follow-up interview: &quot;It was a joke when I said it. But nothing&#x27;s a joke when it&#x27;s transcribed onto the internet. There is a danger, these days, that if things only exist in the streaming version they do get taken down, they come and go,&quot; the director added. 

Streamers have become notoriously known in the last year for pulling original titles from their platforms in order to license them out elsewhere and open up potential revenue streams. When such titles are streaming-only offerings, their removal makes it impossible to view the films elsewhere. Such was the case this year with the Disney+ movie &quot;Crater,&quot; for instance. The streaming-only family adventure was pulled from Disney+ in June and could not be viewed anywhere until it was reissued as a digital release months later in September. For Nolan, owning physical media is the only way to combat such streaming trends. Guillermo del Toro agrees, having shared Nolan&#x27;s recent quotes on X (formerly Twitter) and adding his own commentary on the issue. &quot;Physical media is almost a Fahrenheit 451 (where people memorized entire books and thus became the book they loved) level of responsibility,&quot; del Toro wrote to his followers. &quot;If you own a great 4K HD, Blu-ray, DVD etc etc of a film or films you love...you are the custodian of those films for generations to come.&quot;

                              <span>Computer science teachers around the globe have been left scrambling to find an alternative IDE for their students, after Replit announced it was shuttering its Teams for Education plan. From a report: &quot;To focus on improving the Replit experience for all users, we have made the difficult decision to deprecate Teams for Edu ... Teams for Edu will no longer receive new features or bug fixes, and we will suspend the creation of new Teams and Orgs,&quot; a statement from Replit, shared with educators and brought to our attention on Monday by Reg readers, declared last week. The platform provided a collaborative integrated development environment (IDE) tailored toward classrooms. It allowed students to work together on projects at the same time, similar to Google Docs, as well as automating code evaluation to streamline assessments carried out by teachers. 

The decision has sparked frustration among many educators who&#x27;d invested heavily in the platform since Replit made the plan available for free in early 2022. &quot;Computer science teachers in the last 48 hours have had to scramble to try to find alternatives as soon as possible and it will be the students that suffer,&quot; a teacher based in Asia-Pacific told The Register. &quot;Replit was the only organization we are aware of providing online coding with instant assessment and so it was a hugely popular choice with computer science teachers.&quot; In a Xeet last week, CEO Amjad Masad acknowledged the pain the decision to shut down Teams for Education was likely to cause, but said the current system had become economically nonviable.

                              <span>Using fake names, sham LinkedIn profiles, counterfeit work papers and mock interview scripts, North Korean IT workers seeking employment in Western tech companies are deploying sophisticated subterfuge to get hired. From a report: Landing a job outside North Korea to secretly earn hard currency for the isolated country demands highly-developed strategies to convince Western hiring managers, according to documents reviewed by Reuters, an interview with a former North Korean IT worker and cybersecurity researchers. North Korea has dispatched thousands of IT workers overseas, an effort that has accelerated in the last four years, to bring in millions to finance Pyongyang&#x27;s nuclear missile programme, according to the United States, South Korea, and the United Nations. 

&quot;People are free to express ideas and opinions,&quot; reads one interview script used by North Korean software developers that offers suggestions for how to describe a &quot;good corporate culture&quot; when asked. Expressing one&#x27;s thoughts freely could be met with imprisonment in North Korea. The scripts totalling 30 pages, were unearthed by researchers at Palo Alto Networks, a U.S. cybersecurity firm which discovered a cache of internal documents online that detail the workings of North Korea&#x27;s remote IT workforce. The documents contain dozens of fraudulent resumes, online profiles, interview notes, and forged identities that North Korean workers used to apply for jobs in software development.

                              <span>Sunbird, the app that brings iMessage to Android, has temporarily shut down the service over &quot;security concerns.&quot; From a report: In a notice to users, Sunbird says it has &quot;decided to pause Sunbird usage for now&quot; while it investigates reports that its messages aren&#x27;t actually end-to-end encrypted. Sunbird launched in 2022 as a messaging app that attempts to put the blue versus green bubble battle to rest. It has only been available to those who sign up for its waitlist, touting numerous privacy features, like end-to-end encryption, no message data collection, and no ads. 

Last week, Sunbird partnered with Nothing, the phone brand owned by OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei, on the launch of Nothing Chats. The Sunbird-powered messaging service is supposed to let owners of the Phone 2 send texts via iMessage, but it was pulled from the Google Play Store just one day after its launch. At the time, Nothing said it had to fix &quot;several bugs&quot; within the app. However, its removal from the Play Store came around the same time a post from Texts.blog revealed that messages sent via Sunbird may not be end-to-end encrypted.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Firefox users across the internet say that they are encountering an &quot;artificial&quot; five-second load time when they try to watch YouTube videos that exists on Firefox, but not Chrome. Google, meanwhile, told 404 Media that this is all part of its larger effort against ad blockers, and that it doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with Firefox at all. [...] Mozilla, which makes Firefox, told 404 Media that it does not believe this is a Firefox-specific issue. Enough people have posted about it, however, that it is clearly happening for some users and not others. 

In a statement to 404 Media, Google did not provide specifics but also did not deny implementing an artificial wait time. &quot;To support a diverse ecosystem of creators globally and allow billions to access their favorite content on YouTube, we&#x27;ve launched an effort to urge viewers with ad blockers enabled to allow ads on YouTube or try YouTube Premium for an ad free experience, the spokesperson said. &quot;Users who have ad blockers installed may experience suboptimal viewing, regardless of the browser they are using.&quot;

                              <span>Epic Games Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney testified that Google&#x27;s Android operating system is a &quot;fake open platform&quot; in a high-stakes antitrust lawsuit over claims that the technology giant thwarts app market competition. From a report: Sweeney, who founded the company that makes the blockbuster Fortnite, took the witness stand Monday in San Francisco federal court to reinforce his claims that Google Play policies are unlawful and allow Alphabet to maintain a monopoly in the Android mobile-app distribution market. The court fight started in 2020 when Epic marketed Fortnite on Android and sidestepped the Google Play billing system and the 30% revenue cut it was taking from app developers. 

&quot;We very much wanted to avoid that and do business directly with our customers,&quot; Sweeney told jurors. Google denies abusing its market power. The jury trial started two weeks ago and is expected to wrap up in early December. If Epic prevails, Google could be forced to allow competing app marketplaces and payment methods on its app store, threatening billions of dollars in revenue generated by Google Play. Sweeney previously testified in a 2021 trial in a similar antitrust suit targeting Apple&#x27;s App Store policies as unfair and self-serving. Epic mostly lost that fight, which was decided by a federal judge in Oakland, California, after a trial. An appeals court upheld the judge&#x27;s ruling and Epic is now asking the US Supreme Court to review it.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Verge: Music streaming service Spotify struck a seemingly unique and highly generous deal with Google for Android-based payments, according to new testimony in the Epic v. Google trial. On the stand, Google head of global partnerships Don Harrison confirmed Spotify paid a 0 percent commission when users chose to buy subscriptions through Spotify&#x27;s own system. If the users picked Google as their payment processor, Spotify handed over 4 percent -- dramatically less than Google&#x27;s more common 15 percent fee. Google fought to keep the Spotify numbers private during its antitrust fight with Epic, saying they could damage negotiations with other app developers who might want more generous rates.

                              <span>Last week, Android smartphone manufacturer &quot;Nothing&quot; announced that it&#x27;s bringing iMessage to its newest phone through a new &quot;Nothing Chats&quot; app powered by the messaging platform Sunbird. After launching Friday, the app was shut down within 24 hours and the Sunbird app, which Nothing Chat is a clone of, was put &quot;on pause.&quot; The reason? It&#x27;s a security nightmare. Ars Technica reports: The initial sales pitch for this app -- that it would log you into iMessage on Android if you handed over your Apple username and password -- was a huge security red flag that meant Sunbird would need an ultra-secure infrastructure to avoid disaster. Instead, the app turned out to be about as unsecure as you could possibly be. Here&#x27;s Nothing&#x27;s statement: &quot;We&#x27;ve removed the Nothing Chats beta from the Play Store…</span>

                              <span>In an interview with CNBC&#x27;s Jon Fortt today, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that the governance structure of OpenAI needs to change after the AI company&#x27;s sudden firing of CEO Sam Altman. &quot;At this point, I think it&#x27;s very clear that something has to change around the governance,&quot; Nadella said. He added that Microsoft would have &quot;a good dialogue with their board on that.&quot;
 
Unlike traditional private company boards, OpenAI&#x27;s board consists mostly of outsiders and isn&#x27;t tasked with maximizing shareholder value. &quot;[N]one of them hold equity in OpenAI,&quot; notes The Verge. &quot;Instead, their stated mission is to ensure the creation of &#x27;broadly beneficial&#x27; artificial general intelligence, or AGI.&quot; From the report: In his first press interview since Altman&#x27;s ouster, Nadella dismissed concerns of long…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Motherboard: Commercial air crews are reporting something &quot;unthinkable&quot; in the skies above the Middle East: novel &quot;spoofing&quot; attacks have caused navigation systems to fail in dozens of incidents since September. In late September, multiple commercial flights near Iran went astray after navigation systems went blind. The planes first received spoofed GPS signals, meaning signals designed to fool planes&#x27; systems into thinking they are flying miles away from their real location. One of the aircraft almost flew into Iranian airspace without permission. Since then, air crews discussing the problem online have said it&#x27;s only gotten worse, and experts are racing to establish who is behind it.

                              <span>According to Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman, Apple plans to ditch Qualcomm and build its own custom modem that could launch around 2026. MacRumors reports: Writing in his latest Power On newsletter, Gurman says that Apple&#x27;s custom technology aspirations include integrating an in-house modem into its system-on-a-chip (SoC), which would eventually see the launch of MacBooks with built-in cellular connectivity. Gurman says Apple will &quot;probably need two or three additional years to get that chip inside cellular versions of the Apple Watch and iPad -- and the Mac, once the part is integrated into the company&#x27;s system-on-a-chip.&quot;
 
Apple has explored the possibility of developing MacBooks with cellular connectivity in the past. Indeed, the company reportedly considered launching a MacBook Air with 3G connectivity, but former CEO Steve Jobs said in 2008 that Apple decided against it, since it would take up too much room in the case. An integrated SoC would solve that problem. Gurman&#x27;s latest newsletter also said some of Apple&#x27;s other ongoing in-house chip projects include camera sensors, batteries, a combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip that will eventually replace parts from Broadcom, Micro-LED displays for Apple devices, and a non-invasive glucose monitoring system.

                              <span>Firefox 120 will be available tomorrow, bringing support for the Global Privacy Control &quot;Sec-GPC&quot; request header to indicate whether a user consents to a website or service selling or sharing their personal information with third parties. It&#x27;s also enabling the WebAssembly GC extension by default, opening up new languages like Dart and Kotlin to run in the browser. Phoronix&#x27;s Michael Larabel highlights some of the other features included in this release: - Ubuntu Linux users now have the ability to import data from Chromium when both are installed as Snap packages.
- Picture-in-Picture mode now supports corner snapping on Windows and Linux.
- Support for the light-dark() CSS color function that allows setting of colors for both light and dark without needing to use the prefers-color-scheme media feature. This allows conveniently specifying the preferred light color theme value followed by the dark color theme value.
- CSS support for the lh and rlh line height units.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Reuters: Apple has been sued by Venmo and Cash App customers in a proposed class action claiming the iPhone maker abused its market power to curb competition for mobile peer-to-peer payments, causing consumers to pay &quot;rapidly inflating prices.&quot; Four consumers in New York, Hawaii, South Carolina and Georgia filed the lawsuit (PDF) on Friday in San Jose, California, federal court. They alleged Apple violated U.S. antitrust law through its agreements with PayPal&#x27;s Venmo and Block&#x27;s Cash App.
 
Apple&#x27;s agreements limit &quot;feature competition&quot; within peer-to-peer payment apps, including prohibiting existing or new platforms from using &quot;decentralized cryptocurrency technology,&quot; the complaint said. The lawsuit seeks an injunction that could force Apple to divest or segregate its Apple Cash business.

                              <span>The use of environmentally damaging gases in air conditioners and refrigerators could become redundant if a new kind of heat pump lives up to its promise. A prototype, described in a study published last week in Science, uses electric fields and a special ceramic instead of alternately vaporizing a refrigerant fluid and condensing it with a compressor to warm or cool air. From a report: The technology combines a number of existing techniques and has &quot;superlative performance,&quot; says Neil Mathur, a materials scientist at the University of Cambridge, UK. Emmanuel Defay, a materials scientist at the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology in Belvaux, and his collaborators built their experimental device out of a ceramic with a strong electrocaloric effect. Materials that exhibit this effect heat up when exposed to electric fields. 

In an electrocaloric material, the atoms have an electric polarization -- a slight imbalance in their distribution of electrons, which gives these atoms a &#x27;plus&#x27; and a &#x27;minus&#x27; pole. When the material is left alone, the polarization of these atoms continuously swivels around in random directions. But when the material is exposed to an electric field, all the electrostatic poles suddenly align, like hair combed in one direction. This transition from disorder to order means that the electrons&#x27; entropy -- physicists&#x27; way of measuring disorder -- suddenly drops, Defay explains. But the laws of thermodynamics say that the total entropy of a system can never decline, so if it falls somewhere it must increase somewhere else. &quot;The only possibility for the material to get rid of this extra mess is to pour it into the lattice&quot; of its crystal structure, he says. That extra disorder means that the atoms themselves start vibrating faster, resulting in a rise in temperature.

From a report: Negotiations between the Justice Department and Binance include the possibility that its founder Changpeng Zhao would face criminal charges in the US under an agreement to resolve the probe into alleged money laundering, bank fraud and sanctions violations, according to people familiar with the discussions. Zhao, also known as &quot;CZ,&quot; is residing in the United Arab Emirates, which doesn&#x27;t have an extradition treaty with the US, but that doesn&#x27;t prevent him from coming voluntarily. An announcement could come as soon as the end of the month, though the situation remains fluid, according to the people, who asked not to be named discussing a confidential matter.

                              <span>Misplaced concern about existential risk is impeding the opportunity to expand human potential, writes venture capitalist Vinod Khosla. From his op-ed: I was the first venture investor in OpenAI. The weekend drama illustrated my contention that the wrong boards can damage companies. Fancy titles like &quot;Director of Strategy at Georgetown&#x27;s Center for Security and Emerging Technology&quot; can lead to a false sense of understanding of the complex process of entrepreneurial innovation. OpenAI&#x27;s board members&#x27; religion of &quot;effective altruism&quot; and its misapplication could have set back the world&#x27;s path to the tremendous benefits of artificial intelligence. Imagine free doctors for everyone and near free tutors for every child on the planet. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s at stake with the promise of AI.

Which would you have more confidence in? Getting your technology from a nonprofit? Or a for-profit company that is entirely controlled by one human being?&quot; But on Sunday, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella pretty much trashed Smith&#x27;s argument with his announcement that Microsoft was hiring OpenAI&#x27;s co-founders and some of its top talent to head up a &quot;new advanced AI research team.&quot; Another case of Embrace, Extend, and Extinguish?

                              <span>The world is on track for a &quot;hellish&quot; 3C of global heating, the UN has warned before the crucial Cop28 climate summit that begins next week in the United Arab Emirates. From a report: The report found that today&#x27;s carbon-cutting policies are so inadequate that 3C of heating would be reached this century. Temperature records have already been obliterated in 2023 and intensifying heatwaves, floods and droughts have taken lives and hit livelihoods across the globe, in response to a temperature rise of 1.4C to date. Scientists say far worse is to come if temperatures continue to rise. The secretary general of the UN, Antonio Guterres, has said repeatedly the world is heading for a &quot;hellish&quot; future. 

The UN Environment Programme (Unep) report said that implementing future policies already promised by countries would shave 0.1C off the 3C limit. Putting in place emissions cuts pledged by developing countries on condition of receiving financial and technical support would cut the temperature rise to 2.5C, still a catastrophic scenario. To get on track for the internationally agreed target of 1.5C, 22bn tonnes of CO2 must be cut from the currently projected total in 2030, the report said. That is 42% of global emissions and equivalent to the output of the world&#x27;s five worst polluters: China, US, India, Russia and Japan.

                              <span>OpenAI was in open revolt on Monday with 490 employees threatening to leave unless the board resigns and reinstates Sam Altman as CEO, along with cofounder and former president Greg Brockman. Altman was controversially fired by the board on Friday. From a report: &quot;The process through which you terminated Sam Altman and removed Greg Brockman from the board has jeopardized all of this work and undermined our mission and company&quot; the letter reads. &quot;Your conduct has made it clear you did not have the competence to oversee OpenAI.&quot; Remarkably, the letter&#x27;s signees include Ilya Sutskever, the company&#x27;s chief scientist and a member of its board, who has been blamed for coordinating the boardroom coup against Altman in the first place. 

Shortly before the letter was released, Sutskever posted on X: &quot;I deeply regret my participation in the board&#x27;s actions. I never intended to harm OpenAI. I love everything we&#x27;ve built together and I will do everything I can to reunite the company.&quot; The letter&#x27;s release follows an extraordinary, head-spinning weekend in Silicon Valley. OpenAI&#x27;s board removed Altman from his position on Friday, claiming &quot;he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities.&quot;

From a report: Many OpenAI members, including the co-founder Brockman, left the firm in protest last week. Altman will serve as the chief executive of the new AI group at Microsoft, Nadella said. &quot;We&#x27;ve learned a lot over the years about how to give founders and innovators space to build independent identities and cultures within Microsoft, including GitHub, Mojang Studios, and LinkedIn, and I&#x27;m looking forward to having you do the same.&quot; Nadella said Altman and Brockman will be joined by &quot;colleagues.&quot; Former OpenAI top talent Szymon Sidor, Jakub Pachocki, Aleksander Madry are joining Microsoft with &quot;more&quot; to follow suit, Brockman said in a post on X.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this report from ZDNet:

At the Linux Plumbers Conference, the invite-only meeting for the top Linux kernel developers, ByteDance Linux Kernel Engineer Cong Wang, proposed that we use AI and machine learning to tune the Linux kernel for the maximum results for specific workloads... There are thousands of parameters. Even for a Linux expert, tuning them for optimal performance is a long, hard job. And, of course, different workloads require different tunings for different sets of Linux kernel parameters... What ByteDance is working on is a first attempt to automate the entire Linux kernel parameter tuning process with minimal engineering efforts. 

Specifically, ByteDance is working on tuning Linux memory management. ByteDance has found that with machine learning algorithms, such as Bayesian optimization, automated tuning could even beat most Linux kernel engineers. Why? Well, the idea, as Wang wryly put it, &quot;is not to put Linux kernel engineers out of business.&quot; No, the goal is &quot;to liberate human engineers from tuning performance for each individual workload. While making better decisions with historical data, which humans often struggle with. And, last, but never least, find better solutions than those we come up with using our current trial and error, heuristic methods. 

In short, ByteDance&#x27;s system optimizes resource usage by making real-time adjustments to things like CPU frequency scaling and memory management.

                              <span>Today saw the end of IFComp.org&#x27;s 29th annual text adventure competition (now administered by the charitable non-profit IF Technology Foundation). 74 new and original text adventures
 competed for a share of the $7,523 prize pool, with the winners announced in a special online ceremony on Twitch this afternoon. 

After all the votes were tabulated, the winning game was Dr Ludwig and the Devil, a 90-minute epic in which an esteemed mad scientist tries to double-cross Beelzebub himself — along with &quot;the world&#x27;s least effective torch and pitchfork-wielding mob!&quot; Coming in second was LAKE Adventure. (Its premise? That it&#x27;s a 13-year-old&#x27;s 1993 game being revisited by its author 28 years later — complete with some gloriously retro artwork.) And finishing third was The Little Match Girl 4 (described as &quot;a touching epic time travel fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen.) 

But also this week, the owner of the web site 80sNostalgia.com has created a text adventure using nothing but inter-linked posts on Threads. 
&quot;Think you can get under The Bridge?&quot; its first post challenges. &quot;Test your gaming skills with this Threads exclusive text-based game!

You are an individual contributor at heart. You like writing code and solving technical problems. You dislike meetings and ceremony. Here’s what you can do to maximize what you like and minimize what you don’t: radiate information.

The daily standup meetings that Scrum popularized have bad press for a reason. The daily periodicity is way too much. And using a recurring meeting to give people a chance to catch up is atrociously disruptive and inefficient. But the questions themselves make sense: What did you do? What are you going to do? Are there any blockers? You should aim to communicate that information routinely, just not in a meeting.

The Washington Post explains...


McIntyre, who served as publisher at Razorbill, an imprint of Penguin Random House, was diagnosed in 2019 and proceeded through treatment without taking on debt, [husband Andrew Rose] Gregory told The Washington Post. But many fellow cancer patients she met were in more precarious financial positions, Gregory added. &quot;We were both so keenly aware that Casey had great health insurance through Penguin Random House,&quot; said Gregory, 41. &quot;Casey had no medical debt....&quot; 

About nine months before McIntyre died, her husband came across a video online about members of a North Carolina…</span>

In a blog post they call the updates &quot;an initiative that has become a cornerstone of the IT world&#x27;s approach to cybersecurity.&quot;
Originating from the Trustworthy Computing memo by Bill Gates in 2002, our unwavering commitment to protecting customers continues to this day and is reflected in Microsoft&#x27;s Secure Future Initiative announced this month. Each month, we deliver security updates on the second Tuesday, underscoring our pledge to cyber defense.

                              <span>The Free Sofware Foundation issued a clarifying blog post this week, saying the organization is &quot;pleased when people use GNU licenses to distribute and license software.&quot; 


But &quot;we condemn the use of unauthorized, confusing derivatives of the licenses.&quot;
Unfortunately, some authors engage in confusing practices by drafting licenses using existing terms and conditions of GNU free software licenses, without the intention of granting all four freedoms to users. For example, we have long seen attempts to add restrictions to the license text itself, placed in the LICENSE file, or included elsewhere in the program&#x27;s release. An example is the so-called &quot;Commons Clause,&quot; which, when applied to a free software license, affirms that the program is covered by the license. But, at the same time, is c…</span>

There have been remakes for other architectures over the years, including Atari ST, Gameboy color, and Commodore 64. At this past Demosplash 2023 demoparty a version for the Apple II was released (and won 1st place), which was quite a challenge as the Apple II graphics have essentially none of the hardware acceleration available on the other platforms.

                              <span>&quot;And no, it&#x27;s not COBOL,&quot; jokes long-time Slashdot reader schwit1, sharing this report from ScienceAlert:


A secret text has been discovered in Türkiye, scattered among tens of thousands of ancient clay tablets, which were written in the time of the Hittite Empire during the second millennium BCE. No one yet knows what the curious cuneiform script says, but it seems to be a long-lost language from more than 3,000 years ago. 

Experts say the mysterious idiom is unlike any other ancient written language found in the Middle East, although it seems to share roots with other Anatolian-Indo-European languages. The sneaky scrawlings start at the end of a cultic ritual text written in Hittite — the oldest known Indo-European tongue — after an introduction that essentially translates to: &quot;From now on, read in the language of the country of Kalasma&quot;...

Currently, there are no available photos of the newly discovered tablet with Kalamaic writings, as experts are still working out how to translate it. Schwemer and his colleagues hope to publish their results along with images of their discovery sometime next year.

&quot;Hoping to overcome those difficulties, computer scientist Chris Lattner set out to create a new language, Mojo, which offers the ease of use of Python, but the performance of more complex languages such as C++ or Rust.&quot; Lattner tells the site &quot;we don&#x27;t want to break Python, we want to make Python better,&quot; while software architect Doug Meil says Mojo is essentially &quot;Python for AI... and it&#x27;s going to be way faster in scale across multiple hardware platforms.&quot;

                              <span>Recently the Register pointed out that the new (Debian-based) Raspberry Pi OS 5.0 has &quot;a completely new Wayland desktop environment replacing PIXEL, the older desktop based on LXDE and X.org, augmented with Mutter in its previous release.&quot; 

And when elementary OS 8 finally arrives, &quot;the development team plans to finally shift to the Wayland display server by default,&quot; reports Linux magazine (adding &quot;If you&#x27;d like to get early access to daily builds, you can do so by becoming an elementary OS sponsor on GitHub.&quot;) 

&quot;This is a transition that we have been planning and working towards for several years,&quot; writes CEO/co-founder Danielle Foré, &quot;and we&#x27;re finally in the home stretch... Wayland will bring us improved performance, better app security, and opens the doors to support more complex display setups like mixed DPI multi-monitor setups.&quot;
There are other things that we&#x27;re experimenting with, like the possibility of an immutable OS, and there are more mundane things that will certainly happen like shipping Pipewire. You&#x27;ll also see on the project board that we&#x27;re looking to replace the onscreen keyboard and it&#x27;s time to re-evaluate some things like SystemD Boot. You can expect lots more little features to be detailed over the coming months. 

Meanwhile, Linux Mint is getting &quot;experimental&quot; Wayland support next month. And also in December, Firefox will let Wayland support be enabled by default. 

And last month the Register noted a merge request for GNOME to remove the gnome-xorg.desktop file. &quot;To put this in context, the Fedora project is considering a comparable change: removing or hiding the GNOME on X.org session from the login menu, which is already the plan for the Fedora KDE spin when it moves to KDE version 6, which is still in development.&quot;

So-called &quot;artificial&quot; intelligence is the latest extension of the emergent process through which life takes ever more diverse and complex forms.

The onslaught of attacks — often of a vile and deeply personal nature — is part of a well-organized, increasingly brazen Chinese government intimidation campaign targeting people in the United States, documents show.

Kotlin, Tiobe CEO Paul Jansen said, also fits in with a modern programming culture of expressive languages that have a strong type system and avoid null pointer exceptions by design. &quot;Based on my experience, I am pretty sure Kotlin can reach a top 10 position,&quot; Jansen said. It remains to be seen if it can ever scale as high as a top four slot, he added... 
In the rival Pypl Popularity of Programming languages index this month, Kotlin was ranked 13th with a 1.76% share, having slipped slightly year-over-year. 

Kotlin&#x27;s rank on the TIOBE index rose three positions in the last month — after rising two positions the month before. TIOBE&#x27;s CEO says the language has now achieved its highest ranking ever on the index, surpassing 2017&#x27;s &quot;first wave of Kotlin popularity...when Google announced first class support for Kotlin on Android.&quot; 
Rust now ranks #20 on the index, behind Delphi/Object Pascal, Swift, Ruby, and R. 

Here&#x27;s TIOBE November rankings for top-20 most popular programming languages:

In a possibly related development, Forbes reports that &quot;A day after OpenAI&#x27;s board of directors fired former CEO Sam Altman in a shock development, investors in the company are plotting how to restore him, in what would amount to an even more surprising counter-coup.&quot;

Venture capital firms holding positions in OpenAI&#x27;s for-profit entity have discussed working with Microsoft and senior employees at the company to bring back Altman, even as he has signaled to some that he intends to launch a new startup, four…</span>

                              <span>Bill Gates argues that when it comes to climate change, &quot;there are more reasons to be hopeful than many people realize — and it&#x27;s not just that renewable energy sources like wind and solar are getting cheaper. 

&quot;And it&#x27;s not just because many of the steps already taken to reduce carbon emissions are working: Carbon emissions from fossil fuels will probably peak in 2025.&quot;
The main thing that makes me optimistic is all the innovation I&#x27;m seeing. As someone who has been funding climate solutions for years, I get to learn from ingenious scientists who are working on ideas that will help the world solve climate change. And their work makes me confident that innovation will help the world get on track to meet its climate goals.

Now the other piece of the puzzle is available: the source code (mostly in assembly, with some C and Pascal) to their microcomputer interpreters.

 Infocom, publisher of the best-selling Zork series, ported their text adventures to most of the diverse microcomputer platforms of the 1980s by using an early virtual machine, known as the Z-machine or ZIP. This enabled them to sell games simultaneously for everything from the TI-99/4A to the Commodore 128. Hobbyists reverse-engineered the technology in the 1990s to create modern implementations, but now the original source code can be studied directly.

In brief, Rust Linux is continuing to mature and is getting strong support from developers and vendors, such as Cisco, Samsung, and Canonical... Rust is taking the steps it needs to become — along with C — a fully-fledged member of the Linux language toolchain... That&#x27;s not to say that we&#x27;re ready to retire C for Rust just yet. In fact, that day is unlikely ever to come. But Rust is definitely on its way to becoming an important language for Linux development... 

As for the day-to-day work that&#x27;s required to make Rust fully integrated with Linux, the &quot;official&quot; website of the initiative is now the se…</span>

                              <span>&quot;NFTs aren&#x27;t gone yet,&quot; writes the Verge. 

&quot;Disney will launch an &#x27;all-new socially driven collectible experience&#x27; called Disney Pinnacle later this year, turning characters from Pixar, Star Wars, and its classic animated films into tradable digital pins.&quot;


While announcing Pinnacle, Disney and its partner Dapper Labs won&#x27;t even say the word &quot;NFT.&quot; Dapper Labs still calls itself &quot;the NFT company,&quot; but between a variety of scams, an eye-blistering episode at a recent Bored Ape event, and a market that has plunged since peaking in early 2021, that&#x27;s a term they apparently will steer clear of. The only thing available on the site right now is a privacy policy that makes clear this is a Dapper Labs effort that&#x27;s licensing content from Disney — not an in-house effort on the level of Disney Plus. 

The NFT collection is being launched through an iOS app, and a spokesperson tells CoinDesk that web and Android applications will come later.

 
The Disney Pinnacle website has a few seconds of background animation showing the pins — and, of course, a waitlist signup form.

Yet OpenAI&#x27;s move &quot;also blindsided key investor and minority owner Microsoft,&quot; writes Ars Technica, &quot;reportedly making CEO Satya Nadella furious.&quot; 


Tech reporter Kara Swisher called the firing a &quot;badly managed coup de Sam,&quot; tweeting more details Friday night. &quot;Sources tell me that the profit direction of the company under Altman and the speed of development, which could be seen as too risky, and the nonprofit side dedicated to more safety and caution were at odds.

                              <span>CNN reports

SpaceX made a second attempt to successfully launch Starship, the most powerful rocket ever constructed. The uncrewed rocket took off just after 7 a.m. CT (8 a.m. ET). The rocket took off as intended, making it roughly 8 minutes into flight before SpaceX confirmed it had to intentionally explode the Starship spacecraft as it flew over the ocean... 

This mission comes after months of back-and-forth with federal regulators as SpaceX has awaited a launch license. The company is also grappling with pushback from environmentalists... 

After separating from the Super Heavy rocket booster, the Starship spacecraft soared to an altitude of approximately 93 miles (150 kilometers) before SpaceX lost contact, according to a statement issued by the company. For context, the U.S. government considers 50 miles (80 kilometers) above Earth&#x27;s surface the edge of outer space... 

SpaceX is OK with rockets exploding in the early stages of development. That&#x27;s because the company uses a completely different approach to rocket design than, say, NASA. The space agency focuses on building one rocket and strenuously designing and testing it on the ground before its first flight — taking years but all but guaranteeing success on the first launch. SpaceX, however, rapidly builds new prototypes and is willing to test them to their breaking point because there&#x27;s usually a spare nearby. During a drive by the company&#x27;s facilities on Friday — four Starship spacecraft and at least two Super Heavy boosters could be seen from public roadways. 
CNN reminds readers that &quot;so far in 2023 alone, the Falcon 9 has launched more than 70 spaceflights... 


&quot;Elon Musk described Starship as the vehicle that underpins SpaceX&#x27;s founding purpose: sending humans to Mars for the first time. NASA has its own plans for the rocket.&quot;

The article notes a threat assessment from U.S. Space Force Chief Master Sergeant Ron Lerch:

What&#x27;s most concerning isn&#x27;t the swarm of satellites but the types. &quot;We know that there are kinetic kill vehicles,&quot; Lerch said — for example, a Russian &quot;nesting doll&quot; satellite, in which a big satellite releases a tiny one and the tiny one releases a mechanism that can strike and damage another satellite. There are machines with the ability to cast nets and extend grappling hooks, too. China, whose presence in space now far outpaces Russia&#x27;s, is launching unmanned &quot;space planes&quot; into orbit, testing potentially unbreakable quantum comm…</span>

Three weeks ago a new podcast launched with Python core developer/steering council member Pablo Galindo and Python developer-in-residence Åukasz Langa.

This month the Python Sofware Foundation announced its seventh Python Developers Survey. 

And for the fifth year in a row the foundation partnered with JetBrains to offer a 30% discount on JetBrains&#x27; dedicated Python Integrated Development Environment &quot;PyCharm&quot; — with all proceeds benefitting the Python Software Foundation (&quot;The discount will be automatically applied when you check out. The promotion will only be available through November 27th...&quot;) 

A PSF blog post about the fundraiser notes you can also just make a direct donation to the Python Software Foundation, or sign up to become a foundation member to &quot;help us sustain what we do.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from SecurityWeek: Moving to clamp down on the growing scourge of SIM-swapping and port-out fraud, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has unveiled new rules mandating telcos to give consumers greater control of their mobile phone accounts. Under the new rules, wireless carriers are required to notify customers of any SIM transfer requests, a measure designed to thwart fraudulent attempts by cybercriminals. The FCC has also revised its customer proprietary network information and local number portability rules, making it more challenging for scammers to access sensitive subscriber information.
 
The new protective measures (PDF) are meant to address SIM-swapping and port-out attacks widely documented in cybercriminal attacks against businesses and consumers. The attack technique is used to hijack mobile accounts, change and steal passwords, bypass MFA roadblocks and raid bank accounts. Studies have found that major mobile carriers in the US are vulnerable to SIM-swapping with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) receiving thousands of consumer complaints every year.

                              <span>The world&#x27;s largest single-site solar farm has gone online in the United Arab Emirates. Called the Al Dhafra solar farm, it features almost 4 million bifacial solar panels and will power nearly 200,000 homes -- all while eliminating 2.4 million tons of carbon emissions annually. Electrek reports: Now that Al Dhafra is online, the UAE&#x27;s solar power production capacity has increased to 3.2 GW. In September, EWEC called for proposals to develop a 1.5 GW solar farm in Al Khazna near Abu Dhabi. UAE is aiming to triple its renewable energy capacity to 14 GW by 2030. The UAE is hosting COP28 in Dubai, which kicks off on November 30, so, understandably, its rulers would time the launch of the world&#x27;s largest solar farm just ahead of that event -- it&#x27;s simply good PR.
 
UAE is rightly being criticized for putting the CEO of its state oil company, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company -- the world&#x27;s 12th-biggest oil company by production -- in charge of COP28. It&#x27;s also being criticized for hosting COP28 yet having an all-of-the-above approach to energy. The UAE Energy Strategy 2050 targets an energy mix of 44% clean energy, 38% gas, 12% &quot;clean coal&quot; (yes, it really says that), and 6% nuclear. It says it will become carbon neutral by 2050, but how it will do that on 50% fossil fuels is anyone&#x27;s guess.

                              <span>According to a new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine, women in the U.S. are now projected to live about six years longer than U.S. men. TIME reports: [T]he 2021 data represent the largest gender-based life expectancy gap in the U.S. since 1996. The gulf began to widen before the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors note, but the trend accelerated from 2019 to 2021. Deaths from COVID-19 and unintentional injuries, a category that includes accidental drug overdoses, were the largest contributors to the widening of the gap, but differential rates of homicide, heart disease, and suicide deaths also played a role, according to the report. It&#x27;s well-established that men die of these causes more frequently than women, and in recent years, they have been some of the most common causes of death overall. Heart disease, COVID-19, and unintentional injuries accounted for three of the top five in 2021.
 
The gender gap would have been even wider, the authors note, but for factors including increases in maternal mortality and decreases in cancer deaths among men. Overall, the data underscore the continued importance of limiting COVID-19&#x27;s spread, and of finding better ways to improve national mental health and prevent drug overdoses and suicides -- fatalities sometimes labeled by experts as &quot;deaths of despair.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: This Sunday, November 19, makes a full 25 years since the original Half-Life first hit (pre-Steam) store shelves. To celebrate the anniversary, Valve has uploaded a feature-packed &quot;25th anniversary update&quot; to the game on Steam, and made the title free to keep if you pick it up this weekend. Valve&#x27;s 25th Anniversary Update page details a bevy of new and modernized features added to the classic first-person shooter, including:
 - Four new multiplayer maps that &quot;push the limits of what&#x27;s possible in the Half-Life engine&quot; - New graphics settings, including support for a widescreen field-of-view on modern monitors and OpenGL Overbright lighting (still no official ray-tracing support, though-leave that to the modders) - &quot;Proper gamepad config out of the box&quot; (so dust off that Gravis Gamepad Pro) - Steam networking support for easier multiplayer setup - &quot;Verified&quot; support for Steam Deck play (&quot;We failed super hard&quot; on the first verification attempt, Valve writes) - Proper UI scaling for resolutions up to 3840x1600 - Multiplayer balancing updates (because 25 years hasn&#x27;t been enough to perfect the meta) - New entity limits that allow mod makers to build more complex mods - A full software renderer for the Linux version of the game - Various bug fixes - &quot;Removed the now very unnecessary &#x27;Low video quality. Helps with slower video cards&#x27; setting&quot;
 
In addition, the new update includes a host of restored and rarely seen content, including:
 - Three multiplayer maps from the &quot;Half-Life: Further Data&quot; CD-ROM: Double Cross, Rust Mill, and Xen DM - Four restored multiplayer models: Ivan the Space Biker, Proto-Barney (from the alpha build), a skeleton, and Too Much Coffee Man (from &quot;Further Data&quot;) - Dozens of &quot;Further Data&quot; sprays to tag in your multiplayer matches - The original Half-Life: Uplink demo in playable form

                              <span>New submitter doc1623 shares a report from Wired: Swedish workers are uniting against Tesla. [Starting Friday], cleaners will stop cleaning Tesla showrooms, electricians won&#x27;t fix the company&#x27;s charging points, and dockworkers will refuse to unload Tesla cargo at all Swedish ports. What started as a strike by Tesla mechanics is spreading, in something Swedish unions describe as an existential battle between Elon Musk&#x27;s carmaker and the conventions they say make the country&#x27;s labor market fair and efficient. The standoff in Sweden is the biggest union action the company has faced anywhere in the world. Sweden doesn&#x27;t have laws that set working conditions, such as a minimum wage. Instead these rules are dictated by collective agreements, a type of contract that defines the benefits employees…</span>

                              <span>The newly updated U.S. Department of Agriculture&#x27;s &quot;plant hardiness zone map&quot; has gardeners across the nation researching what new plants they can grow in their warming regions, as the 2023 map is about 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the 2012 map. NPR reports: This week the map got its first update in more than a decade, and the outlook for many gardens looks warmer. The 2023 map is about 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the 2012 map across the contiguous U.S., says Chris Daly, director of the PRISM Climate Group at Oregon State University that jointly developed the map with the USDA. Daly says the new map means about half the country has shifted into a new half zone and half hasn&#x27;t. In some locations, people may find they can grow new types of flowers, fruits, vegetables and plants.
 
Daly says he is hesitant to explicitly attribute the specific changes from the 2012 map to the 2023 map to climate change because of the volatility of the key statistic they used to create this map. They were mapping &quot;the coldest night of the year, each year, over the past 30 years&quot;, Daly says, and it&#x27;s a highly variable figure. In an email, a press officer for the USDA says, &quot;Changes to plant hardiness zones are not necessarily reflective of global climate change because of the highly variable nature of the extreme minimum temperature of the year.&quot; But Daly says, in the big picture, climate change is playing a role in changing what grows where in the US: &quot;Over the long run, we will expect to see a slow shifting northward of zones as climate change takes hold.&quot;

                              <span>According to Reuters, Meta&#x27;s head of augmented reality software is stepping down from his role. From the report: VP of Engineering Don Box announced the end of his tenure at Meta internally this week, without elaborating on what he would do next, according to a source familiar with the matter. A Meta spokesperson confirmed Box would be leaving the company at the end of this week and said he was doing so for personal reasons. There would be no change in product roadmap as a result of his decision, she added.
 
The departure of Box, a veteran engineer with experience building major technology systems from their infancy, could be a setback to progress on the operating system, a key component of Meta&#x27;s AR glasses project, the source told Reuters. Meta has been planning to deliver a first gener…</span>

                              <span>A court in Canada struck down a regulation classifying some plastic products as toxic, &quot;a ruling that could hurt a push by Ottawa to ban single-use plastic items like bags, straws and forks.&quot; From the report: A ban on manufacturing and importing &quot;harmful&quot; single-use plastics came into effect last December after the federal government formally drew up a order that added them to a list of toxic items. But the Federal Court in Ottawa overturned that decision, calling the listing &quot;unreasonable and unconstitutional.&quot; The case was brought by plastics manufacturers such as Dow Inc as well as Imperial Oil.
 
The office of Environment Minister Stephen Guilbeault said it was considering an appeal. &quot;We strongly believe in taking action to tackle this crisis and keep millions of garbage bags worth of trash off our beaches, out of our waters, and away from nature,&quot; spokeswoman Kaitlin Power said in a statement.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: On Wednesday, Replicate developer Charlie Holtz combined GPT-4 Vision (commonly called GPT-4V) and ElevenLabs voice cloning technology to create an unauthorized AI version of the famous naturalist David Attenborough narrating Holtz&#x27;s every move on camera. As of Thursday afternoon, the X post describing the stunt had garnered over 21,000 likes. &quot;Here we have a remarkable specimen of Homo sapiens distinguished by his silver circular spectacles and a mane of tousled curly locks,&quot; the false Attenborough says in the demo as Holtz looks on with a grin. &quot;He&#x27;s wearing what appears to be a blue fabric covering, which can only be assumed to be part of his mating display.&quot; &quot;Look closely at the subtle arch of his eyebrow,&quot; it continues, as if narrating a BBC wildlife documentary. &quot;It&#x27;s as if he&#x27;s in the midst of an intricate ritual of curiosity or skepticism. The backdrop suggests a sheltered habitat, possibly a communal feeding area or watering hole.&quot;
 
How does it work? Every five seconds, a Python script called &quot;narrator&quot; takes a photo from Holtz&#x27;s webcam and feeds it to GPT-4V -- the version of OpenAI&#x27;s language model that can process image inputs -- via an API, which has a special prompt to make it create text in the style of Attenborough&#x27;s narrations. Then it feeds that text into an ElevenLabs AI voice profile trained on audio samples of Attenborough&#x27;s speech. Holtz provided the code (called &quot;narrator&quot;) that pulls it all together on GitHub, and it requires API tokens for OpenAI and ElevenLabs that cost money to run. During the demo video, when Holtz holds up a cup and takes a drink, the fake Attenborough narrator says, &quot;Ah, in its natural environment, we observe the sophisticated Homo sapiens engaging in the critical ritual of hydration. This male individual has selected a small cylindrical container, likely filled with life-sustaining H2O, and is tilting it expertly towards his intake orifice. Such grace, such poise.&quot;

                              <span>Sam Altman has been fired as CEO of OpenAI, the company announced on Friday. Slashdot reader tagous submitted this statement from OpenAI&#x27;s board: Mr. Altman&#x27;s departure follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities. The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI. 
The Verge reports:
Chief technology officer Mira Murati will be the interim CEO, effective immediately. The company will be conducting a search for the permanent CEO successor. Employees at OpenAI found out about the news when it was announced publicly, according to multiple sources. This is an extremely sudden turn of events as Altman has largely been the face of OpenAI, which arguably kickstarted the current AI arms race with last year&#x27;s hugely popular ChatGPT. Just last week, Altman keynoted at the company&#x27;s DevDay conference, where it announced a suite of major new updates to compete with other big tech companies like Microsoft and Google. Altman also spoke at Thursday&#x27;s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference. &quot;I loved my time at OpenAI,&quot; Altman said in a post on X. &quot;It was transformative for me personally, and hopefully the world a little bit. Most of all I loved working with such talented people. Will have more to say about what&#x27;s next later.&quot;

                              <span>Google&#x27;s company-defining effort to catch up to ChatGPT creator OpenAI is turning out to be harder than expected. From a report: Google representatives earlier this year told some cloud customers and business partners they would get access to the company&#x27;s new conversational AI, a large language model known as Gemini, by November. But the company recently told them not to expect it until the first quarter of next year, according to two people with direct knowledge. The delay comes at a bad time for Google, whose cloud sales growth has slowed while that of its bigger rival, Microsoft, has accelerated. Part of Microsoft&#x27;s success has come from selling OpenAI&#x27;s technology to its customers.

                              <span>After months of wrangling, the European Commission says it has decided to renew the license for the weedkiller compound glyphosate, approving its use in European Union countries for ten more years. From a report: Following the decision yesterday, the Commission released a statement saying that, on the basis of comprehensive safety assessments carried out by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), it would renew the licence, &quot;subject to certain new conditions and restrictions.&quot; These include a ban on the use of the chemical to dry crops before harvest, and &quot;the need for certain measures to protect non-target organisms.&quot; Governments can still restrict the use of glyphosate in their own countries if they consider the risks too high, particularly in regard to the need to protect biodiversity, the statement added. 

Glyphosate is the active ingredient in Roundup, the world&#x27;s most widely used herbicide. Over the years, a debate has developed about whether the chemical is safe to use on food crops, as well as its possible environmental impacts. Some studies point to a link between glyphosate and certain cancers; others suggest that the way in which it is used should not harm consumers. Glyphosate has been investigated extensively by food- and chemicals-safety agencies, but disagreements among researchers remain. The license allowing glyphosate&#x27;s use in the EU was last renewed for five years in 2017. Ahead of the authorization&#x27;s expiry in last December, the European Union temporarily extended it for another year to allow the EFSA to assess some 2,400 studies about the compound and to make a recommendation to governments.

                              <span>Doctors have long relied on a few key patient characteristics to assess risk of a heart attack or stroke, using a calculus that considers blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking and diabetes status, as well as demographics: age, sex and race. Now, the American Heart Association is taking race out of the equation. From a report: The overhaul of the widely used cardiac-risk algorithm is an acknowledgment that, unlike sex or age, race identification in and of itself is not a biological risk factor. The scientists who modified the algorithm decided from the start that race itself did not belong in clinical tools used to guide medical decision making, even though race might serve as a proxy for certain social circumstances, genetic predispositions or environmental exposures that raise the risk of cardiovascular disease. 

The revision comes amid rising concern about health equity and racial bias within the U.S. health care system, and is part of a broader trend toward removing race from a variety of clinical algorithms. &quot;We should not be using race to inform whether someone gets a treatment or doesn&#x27;t get a treatment,&quot; said Dr. Sadiya Khan, a preventive cardiologist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, who chaired the statement writing committee for the American Heart Association, or A.H.A. The statement was published on Friday [PDF] in the association&#x27;s journal, Circulation. An online calculator using the new algorithm, called PREVENT, is still in development.

                              <span>Davide Castelvecchi, writing for Nature: A Nature retraction last week has put to rest the latest claim of room-temperature superconductivity -- in which researchers said they had made a material that could conduct electricity without producing waste heat and without refrigeration. The retraction follows the downfall of an even more brazen claim about a supposed superconductor called LK-99, which went viral on social media earlier this year. Despite these high-profile setbacks, superconductivity researchers say the field is enjoying somewhat of a renaissance. &quot;It&#x27;s not a dying field -- on the contrary,&quot; says Lilia Boeri, a physicist who specializes in computational predictions at the Sapienza University of Rome. The progress is fuelled in part by the new capabilities of computer simulations to predict the existence and properties of undiscovered materials. 

Much of the excitement is focused on &#x27;super-hydrides -- hydrogen-rich materials that have shown superconductivity at ever-higher temperatures, as long as they are kept at high pressure. The subject of the retracted Nature paper was purported to be such a material, made of hydrogen, lutetium and nitrogen. But work in the past few years has unearthed several families of materials that could have revolutionary properties. &quot;It really does look like we&#x27;re on the hairy edge of being able to find a lot of new superconductors,&quot; says Paul Canfield, a physicist at Iowa State University in Ames and Ames National Laboratory.

                              <span>The way we buy and sell homes in the U.S. isn&#x27;t normal -- at least not compared with the rest of the world. From a report: The commission on a home sale here is typically around 5% to 6%, usually split between the seller&#x27;s and buyer&#x27;s agents. In most countries, the commissions are substantially smaller. The U.S. is home to as many as three million agents. By most estimates, no other country is even a close second. 

Though it is unclear how much a court decision on commissions last month will upend American real estate, if at all, the ruling opens up the possibility of forever changing how agents are paid for their work. And looking at home sales around the world offers a window into what could be in store. One reason commissions here remain high is the use of buyer agents, said Ryan Tomasello, managing director at investment bank Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods. Home sellers pay the commission -- typically between 5% and 6% of a home&#x27;s selling price -- which is usually split between the seller&#x27;s and buyer&#x27;s agent. Buyer agents aren&#x27;t nearly as common in other parts of the world, said Tomasello. 

[...] In the pre-internet days, a buyer agent&#x27;s main job was to screen and filter listings for hopeful home buyers. Today, much of that early house hunting can be done online. So the role of the buyer agent has shifted more to providing advice and support, as well as recommendations for home inspectors, lenders and lawyers. A good buyer agent will know how to make a strong offer and may push to lower the home price. In most countries, buyer agents are much less of a factor.

                              <span>Canonical hosted an amusingly failure-filled demo of its new easy-to-install, Ubuntu-powered tool for building small-to-medium scale, on-premises high-availability clusters, Microcloud, at an event in London yesterday. From a report: The intro to the talk leaned heavily on Canonical&#x27;s looming 20th anniversary, and with good reason. Ubuntu has carved out a substantial slice of the Linux market for itself on the basis of being easier to use than most of its rivals, at no cost -- something that many Linux players still seem not to fully comprehend. The presentation was as buzzword-heavy as one might expect, and it&#x27;s also extensively based on Canonical&#x27;s in-house tech, such as the LXD containervisor, Snap packaging, and, optionally, the Ubuntu Core snap-based immutable distro. (The only missing buzzword didn&#x27;t crop up until the Q&amp;A session, and we were pleased by its absence: it&#x27;s not built on and doesn&#x27;t use Kubernetes, but you can run Kubernetes on it if you wish.) 

We&#x27;re certain this is going to turn off or alienate a lot of the more fundamentalist Penguinistas, but we are equally sure that Canonical won&#x27;t care. In the immortal words of Kevin Smith, it&#x27;s not for critics. Microcloud combines several existing bits of off-the-shelf FOSS tech in order to make it easy to link from three to 50 Ubuntu machines into an in-house, private high-availability cluster, with live migration and automatic failover. It uses its own LXD containervisor to manage nodes and workloads, Ceph for distributed storage, OpenZFS for local storage, and OVN to virtualize the cluster interconnect. All the tools are packaged as snaps. It supports both x86-64 and Arm64 nodes, including Raspberry Pi kit, and clusters can mix both architectures. The event included several demonstrations using an on-stage cluster of three ODROID machines with &quot;Intel N6005&quot; processors, so we reckon they were ODROID H3+ units -- which we suspect the company chose because of their dual Ethernet connections.

                              <span>The technology has become the standard LAN worldwide. From a report: Ethernet became commercially available in 1980 and quickly grew into the industry LAN standard. To provide computer companies with a framework for the technology, in June 1983 Ethernet was adopted as a standard by the IEEE 802 Local Area Network Standards Committee. Currently, the IEEE 802 family consists of 67 published standards, with 49 projects under development. The committee works with standards agencies worldwide to publish certain IEEE 802 standards as international guidelines. 

A plaque recognizing the technology is displayed outside the PARC facility. It reads: &quot;Ethernet wired LAN was invented at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in 1973, inspired by the ALOHAnet packet radio network and the ARPANET. In 1980 Xerox, DEC, and Intel published a specification for 10 Mbps Ethernet over coaxial cable that became the IEEE 802.3-1985 Standard. Later augmented for higher speeds, and twisted-pair, optical, and wireless media, Ethernet became ubiquitous in home, commercial, industrial, and academic settings worldwide.&quot;

                              <span>One of the world&#x27;s most active ransomware groups has taken an unusual -- if not unprecedented -- tactic to pressure one of its victims to pay up: reporting the victim to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. From a report: The pressure tactic came to light in a post published on Wednesday on the dark web site run by AlphV, a ransomware crime syndicate that&#x27;s been in operation for two years. After first claiming to have breached the network of the publicly traded digital lending company MeridianLink, AlphV officials posted a screenshot of a complaint it said it filed with the SEC through the agency&#x27;s website. Under a recently adopted rule that goes into effect next month, publicly traded companies must file an SEC disclosure within four days of learning of a security incident that had a &quot;material&quot; impact on their business. 

&quot;We want to bring to your attention a concerning issue regarding MeridianLink&#x27;s compliance with the recently adopted cybersecurity incident disclosure rules,&quot; AlphV officials wrote in the complaint. &quot;It has come to our attention that MeridianLink, in light of a significant breach compromising customer data and operational information, has failed to file the requisite disclosure under item 1.05 of form 8-K within the stipulated four business days, as mandated by the new SEC rules.&quot; The violation category selected in the online report was &quot;Material misstatement or omission in a company&#x27;s filings or financial statements or a failure to file.&quot;

                              <span>Apple announced on Thursday its plans to bring RCS support to the iPhone in 2024. But some things are not going to change, sadly. 9to5Mac reports: Since I published my story on the news this morning, there&#x27;s one thing everyone wants to know: is the blue bubbles vs green bubbles debate coming to an end? I&#x27;m happy to say I now have an official answer: nope. RCS will use green bubbles just like SMS. [...] Apple has confirmed to me that blue bubbles will still be used to represent iMessages, while green bubbles will represent RCS messages. The company uses blue bubbles to denote what it believes is the best and most secure way for iPhone users to communicate, which is iMessage.

                              <span>Alibaba is canceling the scheduled IPO of its cloud division due to the impact of the U.S. government&#x27;s CPU export bans to China. The Register reports: The Chinese e-commerce giant reported the move alongside its calendar Q3 earnings, otherwise a generally positive quarter, with the group reporting an income from operations of $4.6 billion, up 34 percent year-on-year, and revenue of $30.8 billion, up 9 percent. Alibaba also said US export restrictions could affect its business more generally by making it harder for the company to upgrade its existing hardware. [...] It&#x27;s worth noting that the Cloud Intelligence Group brought in $3.789 billion in revenue but earnings before income tax and amortization was $193 million, up 44 percent on the same period a year earlier. Cloud sales growth has stalled in 2023 as customers weigh up their spending. 
&quot;We believe that these new restrictions [referring to expanded restrictions announced in October] may materially and adversely affect Cloud Intelligence Group&#x27;s ability to offer products and services and to perform under existing contracts, thereby negatively affecting our results of operations and financial condition,&quot; Alibaba said. &quot;We believe that a full spin-off of Cloud Intelligence Group may not achieve the intended effect of shareholder value enhancement,&quot; the company added. &quot;Accordingly, we have decided to not proceed with a full spin-off, and instead we will focus on developing a sustainable growth model for Cloud Intelligence Group (CIG) under the fluid circumstances.&quot;
 
&quot;The US needs to stop politicizing and weaponizing trade and tech issues and stop destabilizing global industrial and supply chains,&quot; Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said in response to the US&#x27;s new restrictions.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Prison phone company Global Tel*Link leaked the personal information of nearly 650,000 users and failed to notify most of the users that their personal data was exposed, the Federal Trade Commission said today. The company agreed to a settlement that requires it to change its security practices and offer free credit monitoring and identity protection to affected users, but the settlement doesn&#x27;t include a fine. &quot;Global Tel*Link and two of its subsidiaries failed to implement adequate security safeguards to protect personal information they collect from users of its services, which enabled bad actors to gain access to unencrypted personal information stored in the cloud and used for testing,&quot; the FTC said.

                              <span>Google has announced that its News app and news.google.com will remove support for paid magazines next month. &quot;The removal not only applies to new subscriptions/purchases, but also to existing libraries of magazines,&quot; reports 9to5Google. &quot;That means that users who have paid for magazines to use them in the Google News app will be cut off pretty soon.&quot; From the report: Ahead of the December 18 shutdown, users will be able to export copies of paid magazines. Magazines that cannot be exported due to interactive elements will be eligible for a refund. Google explains: &quot;Support for magazine content in Google News is being discontinued beginning on December 18, 2023, which means if you previously purchased or subscribed to magazines, access from Google News apps or news.google.com to your library of magazines will be removed. To continue to access previously purchased magazine content, we are providing the opportunity to export and save each purchased issue. In some cases, purchased magazines contain interactive elements that cannot be downloaded and saved for future access, and we are offering a refund for this content.&quot;
 
The company further adds that affected users will receive an email titled &quot;An update to Google News magazine support&quot; which will contain instructions on how to download copies of magazines they&#x27;ve paid for. However, the cutoff for downloads and/or refunds is also December 18, 2023, which means the clock is ticking. You can access your library of magazines on News here.

                              <span>Cambridge dictionary&#x27;s word of the year for 2023 is &quot;hallucinate,&quot; a verb that took on a new meaning with the rise in popularity of artificial intelligence chatbots. The Guardian reports: The original definition of the chosen word is to &quot;seem to see, hear, feel, or smell&quot; something that does not exist, usually because of &quot;a health condition or because you have taken a drug.&quot; It now has an additional meaning, relating to when artificial intelligence systems such as ChatGPT, which generates text that mimics human writing, &quot;hallucinates&quot; and produces false information. The word was chosen because the new meaning &quot;gets to the heart of why people are talking about AI,&quot; according to a post on the dictionary site.
 
Generative AI is a &quot;powerful&quot; but &quot;far from perfect&quot; tool, &quot;one we&#x27;re all still learning how to interact with safely and effectively -- this means being aware of both its potential strengths and its current weaknesses.&quot; The dictionary added a number of AI-related entries this year, including large language model (or LLM), generative AI (or GenAI), and GPT (an abbreviation of Generative Pre-trained Transformer). &quot;AI hallucinations remind us that humans still need to bring their critical thinking skills to the use of these tools,&quot; continued the post. &quot;Large language models are only as reliable as the information their algorithms learn from. Human expertise is arguably more important than ever, to create the authoritative and up-to-date information that LLMs can be trained on.&quot;

All of these Windows 11 changes are part of key tweaks that Microsoft has to make to its operating system to comply with the European Commission&#x27;s Digital Markets Act, which comes into effect in March 2024.

                              <span>samleecole writes: People who paid to speak to an AI girlfriend modeled after real life 23-year-old influencer Caryn Marjorie are distraught because the service they paid for, Forever Companions, no longer works. It appears that the service stopped working shortly after Forever Companion CEO and founder John Meyer was arrested for trying to set his own apartment on fire. 

404 Media tested CarynAI today as well as other AI bots and confirmed the service is not working. According to what we saw in the Telegram channel where Forever Companion users start conversations with CarynAI, the service has not been working since October 23. &quot;I terminated my relationship with Forever Voices due to unforeseen circumstances,&quot; Marjorie told 404 Media in an email. &quot;I wish the best for John Meyer and his family as he recovers from his mental health crisis. We didn&#x27;t see this coming but I vow to push CarynAI forward for my fans and supporters.&quot; On October 30, Marjorie also announced that she&#x27;s making a similar AI companion, &quot;CarynAI 2.0,&quot; with another company called Banter AI. On social media for the last few weeks, the official Forever Voices Twitter account has been posting bizarre videos and statements about the CIA, Donald Trump, and the FBI.

Customers will be able to buy a vehicle online and then pick it up or have it delivered by their local dealership, according to Amazon.

                              <span>Despite more than a decade of reminding, prodding, and downright nagging, a surprising number of developers still can&#x27;t bring themselves to keep their code free of credentials that provide the keys to their kingdoms to anyone who takes the time to look for them. From a report: The lapse stems from immature coding practices in which developers embed cryptographic keys, security tokens, passwords, and other forms of credentials directly into the source code they write. The credentials make it easy for the underlying program to access databases or cloud services necessary for it to work as intended. [...] 

The number of studies published since following the revelations underscored just how common the practice had been and remained in the years immediately following Uber&#x27;s cautionary tale. Sadly, the negligence continues even now. Researchers from security firm GitGuardian this week reported finding almost 4,000 unique secrets stashed inside a total of 450,000 projects submitted to PyPI, the official code repository for the Python programming language. Nearly 3,000 projects contained at least one unique secret. Many secrets were leaked more than once, bringing the total number of exposed secrets to almost 57,000.

                              <span>gaiageek writes: Of note, given the recent Slashdot article about Signal opening up to trying out usernames, is the $6 million annual cost of sending SMS messages for account verification, which certainly suggests that getting rid of phone number verification would be a significant cost-saving solution. Signal pays $14 million a year in infrastructure costs, for instance, including the price of servers, bandwidth, and storage. It uses about 20 petabytes per year of bandwidth, or 20 million gigabytes, to enable voice and video calling alone, which comes to $1.7 million a year. The biggest chunk of those infrastructure costs, fully $6 million annually, goes to telecom firms to pay for the SMS text messages Signal uses to send registration codes to verify new Signal accounts&#x27; phone numbers.

                              <span>9to5Mac: In a surprising move, Apple has announced today that it will adopt the RCS (Rich Communication Services) messaging standard. The feature will launch via a software update &quot;later next year&quot; and bring a wide range of iMessage-style features to messaging between iPhone and Android users. Apple&#x27;s decision comes amid pressure from regulators and competitors like Google and Samsung. It also comes as RCS has continued to develop and become a more mature platform than it once was. 

In a statement to 9to5Mac, an Apple spokesperson said that the company believes RCS will offer better interoperability for cross-platform messages. &quot;Later next year, we will be adding support for RCS Universal Profile, the standard as currently published by the GSM Association. We believe RCS Universal Profile will offer a better interoperability experience when compared to SMS or MMS. This will work alongside iMessage, which will continue to be the best and most secure messaging experience for Apple users.&quot;

                              <span>The UK has said it will refrain from regulating the British artificial intelligence sector, even as the EU, US and China push forward with new measures. From a report: The UK&#x27;s first minister for AI and intellectual property, Viscount Jonathan Camrose, said at a Financial Times conference on Thursday that there would be no UK law on AI &quot;in the short term&quot; because the government was concerned that heavy-handed regulation could curb industry growth. The announcement comes as executives and policymakers around the world debate how to regulate the emerging technology, which holds the promise of transforming many industries and driven the rise in large tech company valuations over the past year. 

The EU has led the field, with its legislation on AI regulation expected to come into force before the end of this year. Beijing is also implementing measures to regulate the industry, while US President Joe Biden recently issued an executive order to promote &quot;responsible innovation.&quot; Camrose added: &quot;I would never criticise any other nation&#x27;s act on this. But there is always a risk of premature regulation.&quot; In rushing to introduce industry controls, &quot;you are not actually making anybody as safe as it sounds,&quot; he said. &quot;You are stifling innovation, and innovation is a very very important part of the AI equation.&quot;

                              <span>Samsung has admitted that hackers accessed the personal data of U.K.-based customers during a year-long breach of its systems. From a report: In a statement to TechCrunch, Samsung spokesperson Chelsea Simpson, representing the company via a third-party agency, said Samsung was &quot;recently alerted to a security incident&quot; that &quot;resulted in certain contact information of some Samsung U.K. e-store customers being unlawfully obtained.&quot; Samsung declined to answer further questions about the incident, such as how many customers were affected or how hackers accessed its internal systems. 

In a letter sent to affected customers, Samsung admitted that attackers exploited a vulnerability in an unnamed third-party business application to access the personal information of customers who made purchases at Samsung U.K.&#x27;s store between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020. The letter, which was shared on X (formerly Twitter), Samsung said it didn&#x27;t discover the compromise until more than three years later, on November 13, 2023. Samsung told affected customers that hackers may have accessed their names, phone numbers, postal addresses, and email addresses.

                              <span>Britain&#x27;s drugs regulator has approved a groundbreaking treatment for two painful and debilitating lifelong blood disorders, which works by &quot;editing&quot; the gene that causes them. From a report: The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has given the green light for Casgevy to be used to treat sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. It is the first medicine licensed anywhere that works by deploying gene editing that uses the &quot;genetic scissors,&quot; known as CRISPR, for which its inventors won the Nobel prize for chemistry. 

Casgevy&#x27;s developers hope the pioneering treatment could banish the pain, infections and anaemia sickle cell disease brings and the severe anaemia experienced by those with beta thalassemia. About 15,000 people in the UK, almost all of African or Caribbean heritage, have sickle cell disease. About 1,000 -- mainly of Mediterranean, south Asian, south-east Asian and Middle Eastern background -- have beta thalassemia and need regular blood transfusions to treat their anaemia. Experts in the illnesses hope Casgevy may be a cure, making it no longer necessary for people with the conditions to have a bone marrow transplant. Until now this has been the only treatment available, even though the body can reject the donor marrow. The Sickle Cell Society welcomed the MHRA&#x27;s decision as a &quot;historic moment for the sickle cell community&quot; which &quot;offers [them] newfound hope and optimism.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: In May this year, Alexis Hancock&#x27;s daughter got a children&#x27;s tablet for her birthday. Being a security researcher, Hancock was immediately worried. &quot;I looked at it kind of sideways because I&#x27;ve never heard of Dragon Touch,&quot; Hancock told TechCrunch, referring to the tablet&#x27;s maker. As it turned out, Hancock, who works at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, had good reasons to be concerned. Hancock said she found that the tablet had a slew of security and privacy issues that could have put her daughter&#x27;s and other children&#x27;s data at risk. 

The Dragon Touch KidzPad Y88X contains traces of a well-known malware, runs a version of Android that was released five years ago, comes pre-loaded with other software that&#x27;s considered malware and a &quot;potentially unwanted program&quot; because of &quot;its history and extensive system level permissions to download whatever application it wants,&quot; and includes an outdated version of an app store designed specifically for kids, according to Hancock&#x27;s report, which was released on Thursday and seen by TechCrunch ahead of its publication. Hancock said she reached out to Dragon Touch to report these issues, but the company never responded. Dragon Touch did not respond to TechCrunch&#x27;s questions either. After TechCrunch reached out to the company, Walmart removed the listing from its website, while Amazon said it&#x27;s looking into the matter.

                              <span>Amazon is the driving force behind a trio of advocacy groups working to thwart Microsoft&#x27;s growing ambition to become a major cloud computing contractor for governments, a Bloomberg analysis shows. From the report: The groups -- the Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE), the Coalition for Fair Software Licensing and the Alliance for Digital Innovation -- want to convince policymakers that Microsoft has improperly locked customers into Azure, its cloud computing service, choking off its rivals and hindering the advancement of technology within the government and beyond. These groups have dozens of members. But Amazon is the biggest funder for two of them and the largest company, measured by revenue, that funds another. 

Spokespeople for the groups say no single company determines their agendas. But according to a Bloomberg News review of tax filings, documents and interviews with people familiar with the three groups&#x27; operations, Amazon Web Services plays a direct role in shaping their efforts in ways that would boost the cloud giant. Through aggressive lobbying of policymakers, these groups want to ensure that customers can use popular Microsoft products like Office Suite or Windows on any cloud computing system -- and, in particular, on Amazon Web Services, the world&#x27;s number one cloud infrastructure provider and the retail giant&#x27;s top profit driver. 

To hammer that message, they&#x27;ve filed complaints, lobbied regulators and sought to shape the views of policymakers probing the cloud market. In one case, an Amazon executive is listed as the author of a public comment to the Federal Trade Commission, as well as testimony and letters to Congress on behalf of the group, according to an analysis of the documents&#x27; metadata, revealing the tech giant&#x27;s role in the lobbying campaign. (The group says the documents reflect the consensus position of its members.) Amazon denied it authored statements for the group.

                              <span>Airbnb has acquired a secretive new AI startup, GamePlanner.AI, for around $200 million. TechCrunch reports: GamePlanner was co-founded by Adam Cheyer and Siamak Hodjat. Cheyer famously helped co-launch the startup Siri, which Apple acquired and whose technology became the basis for Apple&#x27;s AI-powered Siri assistant. Hodjat previously worked with Cheyer at Viv Labs, a firm that Samsung bought and leveraged to launch its own AI assistant, Bixby, in 2017. It&#x27;s not immediately clear what GamePlanner does. A LinkedIn search only turns up two associates: Gabe Greenbaum, a general partner at B Capital who sits on GamePlanner&#x27;s board of directors, and Joseph Huang, head of design at GamePlanner. GamePlanner hasn&#x27;t had a web presence for some time; the Internet Archive&#x27;s earliest cache of the website (from December 2021) yields a blank page.
 
But in a canned statement, Airbnb CEO and co-founder Brian Chesky hinted that the 12-person startup combines expertise in AI and design toward crafting AI-driven experiences, sort of like an AI-focused consultancy. &quot;AI will rapidly alter our world more than any other technology in our lifetime, but we need to ensure that it augments humanity in a positive way,&quot; Chesky said, adding that the GamePlanner team will focus on &quot;accelerating&quot; select AI projects and integrating their tooling into Airbnb&#x27;s platform. &quot;Airbnb is one of the more humanistic companies in technology, and I believe that, together with Adam and his team, we can develop some of the best interfaces and practical applications for AI.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Engadget: A group of lawmakers from a House of Representatives committee wants Apple, like many Jon Stewart enthusiasts, to explain why its streaming arm abruptly canceled the talk show The Problem With Jon Stewart. The current affairs TV series hosted by Jon Stewart briefly made its debut on Apple TV+ in 2021 but its time on air ended when the show received the ax for a third season, reportedly due to &quot;disagreements&quot; over show topics.
 
According to Reuters, Lawmakers want to know if the show&#x27;s coverage and criticism of China has anything to do with the show&#x27;s cancellation. The government officials have asked Apple to speak on the issue by Dec 15, 2023. In a letter to the tech giant, the House members wrote that while Apple has the right to determine what content it deems appropriate for its platform, &quot;the coercive tactics of a foreign power should not be directly or indirectly influencing these determinations.&quot; This effort is bipartisan, with members from both Republican and Democratic parties affiliated with the House of Representatives&#x27; Select Committee on Competition with the Chinese Communist Party.

                              <span>Once a product category proves popular, it&#x27;s common for more companies to enter the market. Eventually, many options appear that are essentially mostly the same. Now we&#x27;ve got something that quacks like a commodity.
Once we&#x27;ve got a commodity, generics eventually follow. Devoid of fancy packaging, marketing, and advertising, prices fall while quality remains perfectly acceptable.
Brand name products might be slightly better on some dimensions, but it ultimately becomes a value judgement. A few bucks difference? The confidence of buying a brand name still feels worth it. Many, many bucks different? Maybe not.
This happens in most industries. Maybe not in airplanes, but absolutely in peanut butter. And you know what&#x27;s closer to peanut butter than airplanes? Software is.
Strangely, many software categories have commoditized, but, given that nearly everything is a service these days, operational costs have remained universally high. This makes it hard for lower priced generics to creep in. This means people continue to pay luxury prices for software services that are essentially commodities. We think something&#x27;s wrong with that. Sounds like an opportunity.
This is where ONCE comes in.
One facet of our initial strategy with ONCE is to find those commoditized pay-forever services everyone&#x27;s running, and make our own radically simplified &quot;80/20&quot; versions as pay-once products. And this time you get to own for less, not rent for more. And you&#x27;ll get the code, too.
In about a month we&#x27;ll unveil the first ONCE product. Any guesses?

                              <span>Michael Larabel reports via Phoronix: Guardrails have been in place where the Firefox browser has enabled Wayland by default (when running on recent GTK versions) but as of today that code has been removed... Firefox will try to move forward with stable releases where Wayland will ship by default! Mozilla Bug 1752398 to &quot;ship the Wayland backend to release&quot; has been closed this evening! After the ticket was open for the past two years, it&#x27;s now deemed ready to hopefully ship enabled for Firefox 121!
 
This patch drops the &quot;early beta or earlier&quot; check to let Wayland support be enabled by default when running on recent GTK versions (GTK 3.24.30 threshold). Firefox 121 is due for release around 19 December and if all continues to hold, it will finally ship with the Wayland back-end enabled by default as another big step forward.

                              <span>In what may be a potentially confusing rebranding move, Microsoft today has rebranded Bing Chat to Copilot, sharing the same brand name as multiple other Microsoft AI products. Search Engine Land reports: Bing is no longer &quot;your AI-powered copilot for the web.&quot; However, Microsoft Bing will still provide a combined Search and chat experience. It will just be called CoPilot heading forward. For people who may not want that combined experience, CoPilot will have its own standalone ChatGPT-style experience at https://copilot.microsoft.com/.
 
Microsoft said the rebrand is to unify the Copilot experience: &quot;Our efforts to simplify the user experience and make Copilot more accessible to everyone starts with Bing, our leading experience for the web. Beginning today, Bing Chat and Bing Chat Enterprise are becoming Copilot, with commercial data protection enforced when any eligible user is signed in with Microsoft Entra ID.&quot;
 
While it&#x27;s definitely a more unified experience, it also seems a bit confusing because Microsoft&#x27;s chatbot &quot;companion&quot; is used across multiple apps, including Microsoft 365, Edge, Windows and more -- some free, some not. In addition to Bing Chat, Bing Chat Enterprise is also rebranded as Copilot Pro. It offers the same chat functionality with greater commercial data protection for Microsoft 365 subscribers.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: If you&#x27;ve only ever used standard Qi chargers with devices that don&#x27;t have their own schemes, the Wireless Power Consortium&#x27;s announcement today of the first Qi 2.0 devices being ready to launch before the holidays, with more than 100 in the queue behind them, is great. Qi2 sports a &quot;Magnetic Power Profile&quot; (MPP), created with help by Apple&#x27;s MagSafe team, to help align devices and chargers&#x27; coils for faster, more efficient charging. Qi2-certified devices set onto Qi2 chargers can achieve 15 W charging, up from 7.5 W in the standard Qi scheme.
 
That brings Qi2 devices up to the same speed as iPhones on MagSafe chargers, and it clears up some consumer confusion about how fast a device might charge on Qi, MagSafe, or proprietary charger…</span>

                              <span>Nasa&#x27;s James Webb space telescope has revealed a planet where specks of sand fall as rain, in groundbreaking observations. From a report: The planet, Wasp-107b, lies 200 light years away in the Virgo constellation and had already caught the attention of astronomers because it is very large but very light, earning it the nickname the &quot;candy floss&quot; planet. The latest observations give an unprecedented glimpse of a strange and exotic world beyond our solar system that features silicate sand clouds and rain, scorching temperatures, raging winds and the distinct burnt-matches scent of sulphur dioxide. &quot;Our knowledge of other planets is based on what we know from Earth,&quot; said Prof Leen Decin, of the Catholic Institute (KU) Leuven and first author of the research. &quot;That&#x27;s a very restricted knowledge.&quot; 

The planet was discovered in 2017 after astronomers spotted a telltale periodic flickering of light from its host star each time the planet passed in front of it. &quot;It&#x27;s like a fly in front of a street lamp,&quot; said Decin. &quot;You see a slight dimming of the light.&quot; James Webb takes these observations to the next level by measuring starlight that is filtered through the planet&#x27;s atmosphere. Because different elements absorb different wavelengths of light, the spectrum of starlight indicates which gases are present. Wasp-107b is similar in mass to Neptune but almost the size of Jupiter, and its vast, diffuse nature allows the James Webb telescope to peer deep into its atmosphere.

                              <span>Amazon said on Wednesday that it was removing seven eyedrops products from its website after the Food and Drug Administration warned the company that the eyedrops had not been recognized as safe and effective. From a report: The F.D.A. said in a letter to Andrew Jassy, Amazon&#x27;s chief executive, on Monday that Amazon had violated federal regulations by selling the eyedrops, which claimed to help with problems including pink eye, dry eyes, eyestrain and floaters. &quot;These products are especially concerning from a public health perspective,&quot; the F.D.A. letter said. &quot;Ophthalmic drug products, which are intended for administration into the eyes, in general pose a greater risk of harm to users because the route of administration for these products bypasses some of the body&#x27;s natural defenses.&quot; 

The eyedrops named in the letter are: Similasan Pink Eye Relief, The Goodbye Company Pink Eye, Can-C Eye Drops, Optique 1 Eye Drops, OcluMed Eye Drops, TRP Natural Eyes Floaters Relief, and Manzanilla Sophia Chamomile Herbal Eye Drops. None of the eyedrops appeared to be available for purchase on Amazon on Wednesday morning. The company said in an emailed statement on Wednesday that &quot;safety is a top priority.&quot;

                              <span>Microsoft and Nvidia want to help developers run and configure AI models on their Windows PCs. During the Microsoft Ignite event on Wednesday, Microsoft announced Windows AI Studio: a new hub where developers can access AI models and tweak them to suit their needs. From a report: Windows AI Studio allows developers to access development tools and models from the existing Azure AI Studio and other services like Hugging Face. It also offers an end-to-end &quot;guided workspace setup&quot; with model configuration UI and walkthroughs to fine-tune various small language models (SLMs), such as Microsoft&#x27;s Phi, Meta&#x27;s Llama 2, and Mistral. 

Windows AI Studio lets developers test the performance of their models using Prompt Flow and Gradio templates as well. Microsoft says it&#x27;s going to roll out Windows AI Studio as a Visual Studio Code extension in the &quot;coming weeks.&quot; Nvidia, similarly, revealed updates to TensorRT-LLM, which the company initially launched for Windows as a way to run large language models (LLMs) more efficiently on H100 GPUs. However, this latest update brings TensorRT-LLM to PCs powered by GeForce RTX 30 and 40 Series GPUs with 8GB of RAM or more.

Citing National Geographic and Nat Geo Wild as examples, the paper notes they&#x27;re owned by Disney. Vietnam&#x27;s Ministry of Information and Communications is said to be &quot;concerned&quot; that the withdrawal will allow piracy to run rampant in Vietnam. Multiple high-level trade reports in the U.S. note that piracy has been rampant for years.

                              <span>Tencent dismissed concerns that US export controls will constrain its AI development capabilities, at least for the foreseeable future. From a report: The Shenzhen-based company has stockpiled Nvidia&#x27;s H800 artificial intelligence accelerators, enough to develop its proprietary Hunyuan AI model for at least another couple of generations, President Martin Lau said on an analyst call after earnings on Wednesday. &quot;Right now we actually have one of the largest inventories of AI chips in China among all the players,&quot; Lau said. &quot;We were the first to put in orders for H800 and that allows us to have a pretty good inventory of H800 chips. So we have enough chips to continue our development.&quot; 

The Biden administration in October escalated export controls on AI semiconductors heading to China, depriving the Asian nation from access to a broad range of the world&#x27;s best AI-training hardware. The purpose of the measures is to prevent China&#x27;s military from obtaining the advanced technology, Washington argues, but they&#x27;re also making business harder for the country&#x27;s private sector. Elsewhere in China, AI industry veteran Kai-Fu Lee&#x27;s unicorn startup 01.AI has been buying up the Nvidia chips it needs to develop its own foundation models, with Lee saying the company has enough semiconductors for the next 18 months.

From a report: Loop lets you use flexible, collaborative workspaces and pages to make it easier to cooperate on work. If you&#x27;re familiar with Notion&#x27;s interface at all, Loop looks and feels remarkably similar -- right down to the ability to easily access a bunch of tools and formatting options by typing the forward slash key (which pulls up what Microsoft calls the &quot;insert menu&quot;). But because Loop is built by Microsoft, that means it has some useful integrations with other Microsoft software.

                              <span>The EU has struck a deal that will force the fossil fuel industry to rein in dangerous methane pollution. From a report: Under the proposed law, which is the first of its kind, coal, oil and gas companies would be required to report their methane emissions and take steps to avoid them. The measures include finding and fixing leaks, and limiting wasteful practices such as venting and flaring gas by 2027. Jutta Paulus, a German MEP with the Green grouping who worked on the proposal, said: &quot;Finally, the EU tackles the second most important greenhouse gas with ambitious measures. Less methane emissions mean more climate protection and more energy sovereignty.&quot; 

Methane has more than 80 times the global heating power of carbon dioxide over a 20-year timespan but does not last as long in the atmosphere. Cutting methane emissions is seen as a cheap and easy way to stop extreme weather growing more violent in the short-term. The new EU rules, which were agreed on Wednesday by the European parliament and European Council, mean fossil fuel companies must try to repair leaks no more than five days after finding them, and fully fix them within a month. By the end of next year, operators will have to survey their existing sites and submit action plans to find and fix methane leaks.

                              <span>Microsoft unveiled its first homegrown AI chip and cloud-computing processor in an attempt to take more control of its technology and ramp up its offerings in the increasingly competitive market for AI computing. The company also announced new software that lets clients design their own AI assistants. From a report: The Maia 100 chip, announced at the company&#x27;s annual Ignite conference in Seattle on Wednesday, will provide Microsoft Azure cloud customers with a new way run AI programs that generate content. Microsoft is already testing the chip with its Bing and Office AI products, said Rani Borkar, a vice president who oversees Azure&#x27;s chip unit. Microsoft&#x27;s main AI partner, ChatGPT maker OpenAI, is also testing the processor. Both Maia and the server chip, Cobalt, will debut in some Microsoft data centers early next year. 

Microsoft&#x27;s multi-year investment shows how critical chips have become to gaining an edge in both AI and the cloud. Making them in-house lets companies wring performance and price benefits from the hardware. The initiative also could insulate Microsoft from becoming overly dependent on any one supplier, a vulnerability currently underscored by the industrywide scramble for Nvidia&#x27;s AI chips. Microsoft&#x27;s push into processors follows similar moves by cloud rivals. Amazon.com Inc. acquired a chip maker in 2015 and sells services built on several kinds of cloud and AI chips. Google began letting customers use its AI accelerator processors in 2018.

With Google&#x27;s new &quot;Notes&quot; experiment, launching Wednesday as an opt-in feature through Search Labs, you&#x27;ll be able to. From a report: If you&#x27;ve opted in to Notes, buttons to add and see notes will appear under search results and under articles on Discover in the Google app. When you create a note, you can add colorful fonts and images. During a briefing, Google showed me a note for an article about different kinds of frosting that had green text, an image of a cake, and a heart sticker. (At the bottom of the note, there was a link to the article the note was about.) 

If you post a note, it should show up &quot;within minutes,&quot; unless it&#x27;s flagged for human review, Google VP Cathy Edwards said in an interview with The Verge. When you look at all of the notes for a link, what&#x27;s shown will be ranked dynamically based on things like the user&#x27;s query and a note&#x27;s relevance to the content on the page.

                              <span>Huawei and China Mobile have built a 3,000 kilometer (1,860-mile) internet network linking Beijing to the south, which the country is touting as its latest technological breakthrough. From a report: The two firms teamed up with Tsinghua University and research provider Cernet.com to build what they claim is the world&#x27;s first internet network to achieve a &quot;stable and reliable&quot; bandwidth of 1.2 terabits per second, several times faster than typical speeds around the world. Trials began July 31 and it&#x27;s since passed various tests verifying that milestone, the university said in a statement. 

Tsinghua, Chinese President Xi Jinping&#x27;s alma mater, is plugging the project as an industry-first built entirely on homegrown technology, and credits Huawei prominently in its statement. The Chinese firm in August made waves when it released a 5G smartphone with a sophisticated made-in-China processor, inspiring celebration in Chinese state and social media. That event also spurred debate in Washington about whether the Biden administration has gone far enough in attempts to contain Chinese technological achievement.

                              <span>Fitbit is active in only 23 countries after leaving Mexico, South Africa, and all Latin American countries. &quot;We communicated that we will stop selling Fitbit products in select countries in order to align our hardware portfolio to map closer to Pixel&#x27;s regional availability,&quot; a Google spokesperson confirmed to Cord Cutters News via email. From the report: The move marks a phasing out of Fitbit products after the Big Tech company acquired wearable company in 2021. Last month, Fitbit said it would remove itself from Asian markets Hong Kong, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines, along with European markets Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Romania, and Slovakia. It&#x27;s possible Google is removing Fitbit and Nest from the European markets because they don&#x27;t have a Google Store support. If that changes, Fitbit products and Nest Aware subscriptions could return. New products like the Pixel Watch could also arrive for the first time. &quot;We remain committed to our customers and have not made any changes that impact the existing Fitbit devices they already own. Existing Fitbit customers will continue to have access to the same customer support, warranties will still be honored, and products will continue to receive software and security updates,&quot; the Google spokesperson said.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Intel on Tuesday pushed microcode updates to fix a high-severity CPU bug that has the potential to be maliciously exploited against cloud-based hosts. The flaw, affecting virtually all modern Intel CPUs, causes them to &quot;enter a glitch state where the normal rules don&#x27;t apply,&quot; Tavis Ormandy, one of several security researchers inside Google who discovered the bug, reported. Once triggered, the glitch state results in unexpected and potentially serious behavior, most notably system crashes that occur even when untrusted code is executed within a guest account of a virtual machine, which, under most cloud security models, is assumed to be safe from such faults. Escalation of privileges is also a possibility.

                              <span>A few months ago, by accepting RFC 3355, the decision was made to start working on an official specification for the Rust language. Eric (maintainer of the Rust Reference), Felix (Rust language team), Joel (Rust Foundation) and Mara (author of the RFC) have been working together to get this effort started.
With this blog post, we present the steps we have taken so far and our plans for approaching the rest of this big task.
Editor
One of the first steps was to fill the role of &quot;editor&quot; as laid out in the RFC. The responsibility of coordination and editing of the specification is purposely delegated to the Rust Foundation, to ensure continuity of the work.
As part of the hiring effort for this role by the Foundation, we interviewed a few interested candidates with relevant experience. Becau…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Electrek: On Monday, Rivian released an incremental software update 2023.42, which bricked the infotainment system in R1Ses and R1Ts. The company is frantically working on a fix, but it might not be an OTA. [...] The vehicles are drivable, but software and displays go black. It appears that the 2023.42 software update hangs at 90% on the vehicle screen or 50% on the app screen, and then the vehicle screens black out. All systems appear to still work except for the displays. At the moment, it appears that Amazon vans are not impacted. Update: The company has acknowledged the issue with affected customers but has yet to issue a fix or plan to fix. Rivian&#x27;s vice president of software engineering, Wassim Bensaid, took to Reddit to update users on the situation, writing: &quot;Hi All, We made an error with the 2023.42 OTA update -- a fat finger where the wrong build with the wrong security certificates was sent out. We cancelled the campaign and we will restart it with the proper software that went through the different campaigns of beta testing. Service will be contacting impacted customers and will go through the resolution options. That may require physical repair in some cases. This is on us -- we messed up. Thanks for your support and your patience as we go through this.
 
*Update 1 (11/13, 10:45 PM PT): The issue impacts the infotainment system. In most cases, the rest of the vehicle systems are still operational. A vehicle reset or sleep cycle will not solve the issue. We are validating the best options to address the issue for the impacted vehicles. Our customer support team is prioritizing support for our customers related to this issue. Thank you.&quot;

                              <span>India&#x27;s capital, New Delhi, is preparing a new weapon in the fight against deadly air pollution: cloud seeding. From a report: The experiment, which could take place as early as next week, would introduce chemicals like silver iodide into a cloudy sky to create rain and, it&#x27;s hoped, wash away the fine particulate matter hovering over one of the world&#x27;s largest cities. The need is desperate. Delhi has already tried traffic restriction measures, multimillion-dollar air filtration towers, and the use of fleets of water-spraying trucks to dissolve the particulate matter in the air -- but to no avail. 

The use of cloud seeding, if it goes ahead, would be controversial. &quot;It&#x27;s not at all a good use of resources because it&#x27;s not a solution, it&#x27;s like a temporary relief,&quot; says Avikal Somvanshi, a …</span>

                              <span>Some of the United States&#x27; largest civil liberties groups are urging Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer not to pursue a short-term extension of the Section 702 surveillance program slated to sunset on December 31. From a report: The more than 20 groups -- Demand Progress, the Brennan Center for Justice, American Civil Liberties Union, and Asian Americans Advancing Justice among them -- oppose plans that would allow the program to continue temporarily by amending &quot;must-pass&quot; legislation, such as the bill needed now to avert a government shutdown by Friday, or the National Defense Authorization Act, annual legislation set to dictate $886 billion in national security spending across the Pentagon and US Department of Energy in 2024. 

&quot;In its current form, [Section 702] is dangerous to our liberties and our democracy, and it should not be renewed for any length of time without robust debate, an opportunity for amendment, and -- ultimately -- far-reaching reforms,&quot; a letter from the groups to Schumer says. It adds that any attempt to prolong the program by rushed amendment &quot;would demonstrate blatant disregard for the civil liberties and civil rights of the American people.&quot;

                              <span>The Top500 organization released its semi-annual list of the fastest supercomputers in the world, with the AMD-powered Frontier supercomputer retaining its spot at the top of the list with 1.194 Exaflop/s (EFlop/s) of performance, fending off a half-scale 585.34 Petaflop/s (PFlop/s) submission from the Argonne National Laboratory&#x27;s Intel-powered Aurora supercomputer. From a report: Argonne&#x27;s submission, which only employs half of the Aurora system, lands at the second spot on the Top500, unseating Japan&#x27;s Fugaku as the second-fastest supercomputer in the world. Intel also made inroads with 20 new supercomputers based on its Sapphire Rapids CPUs entering the list, but AMD&#x27;s EPYC continues to take over the Top500 as it now powers 140 systems on the list -- a 39% year-over-year increase. 

Intel and Argonne are currently still working to bring Arora fully online for users in 2024. As such, the Aurora submission represented 10,624 Intel CPUs and 31,874 Intel GPUs working in concert to deliver 585.34 PFlop/s at a total of 24.69 megawatts (MW) of energy. In contrast, AMD&#x27;s Frontier holds the performance title at 1.194 EFlop/s, which is more than twice the performance of Aurora, while consuming a comparably miserly 22.70 MW of energy (yes, that&#x27;s less power for the full Frontier supercomputer than half of the Aurora system). Aurora did not land on the Green500, a list of the most power-efficient supercomputers, with this submission, but Frontier continues to hold eighth place on that list. However, Aurora is expected to eventually reach up to 2 EFlop/s of performance when it comes fully online. When complete, Auroroa will have 21,248 Xeon Max CPUs and 63,744 Max Series &#x27;Ponte Vecchio&#x27; GPUs spread across 166 racks and 10,624 compute blades, making it the largest known single deployment of GPUs in the world. The system leverages HPE Cray EX â&quot; Intel Exascale Compute Blades and uses HPE&#x27;s Slingshot-11 networking interconnect.

                              <span>After a tech entrepreneur and investor lost his password for retrieving $100,000 in bitcoin and hired experts to break open the wallet where he kept it, they failed to help him. But in the process, they discovered a way to crack enough other software wallets to steal $1 billion or more. From a report: On Tuesday, the team is releasing information about how they did it. They hope it&#x27;s enough data that the owners of millions of wallets will realize they are at risk and move their money, but not so much data that criminals can figure out how to pull off what would be one of the largest heists of all time. 

Their start-up, Unciphered, has worked for months to alert more than a million people that their wallets are at risk. Millions more haven&#x27;t been told, often because their wallets were created at cryptocurrency websites that have gone out of business. The story of those wallets&#x27; vulnerabilities underscores the enormous risk in experimental currencies, beyond their wild fluctuations in value and fast-changing regulations. Many wallets were created with code containing profound flaws, and the companies that used that code can disappear. Beyond that, it is a sobering reminder that underneath software infrastructure of all kinds, even ones explicitly dedicated to securing funds, are open-source programs that few or no people oversee. &quot;Open-source ages like milk. It will eventually go bad,&quot; said Chris Wysopal, a co-founder of security company Veracode who advised Unciphered as it sorted through the problem.

                              <span>In research published in Science today, Google DeepMind&#x27;s model, GraphCast, was able to predict weather conditions up to 10 days in advance, more accurately and much faster than the current gold standard. From a report: GraphCast outperformed the model from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in more than 90% of over 1,300 test areas. And on predictions for Earth&#x27;s troposphere -- the lowest part of the atmosphere, where most weather happens -- GraphCast outperformed the ECMWF&#x27;s model on more than 99% of weather variables, such as rain and air temperature. Crucially, GraphCast can also offer meteorologists accurate warnings, much earlier than standard models, of conditions such as extreme temperatures and the paths of cyclones. In September, GraphCast accurately predicted that Hurricane Lee would make landfall in Nova Scotia nine days in advance, says Remi Lam, a staff research scientist at Google DeepMind. Traditional weather forecasting models pinpointed the hurricane to Nova Scotia only six days in advance. 

[...] Traditionally, meteorologists use massive computer simulations to make weather predictions. They are very energy intensive and time consuming to run, because the simulations take into account many physics-based equations and different weather variables such as temperature, precipitation, pressure, wind, humidity, and cloudiness, one by one. GraphCast uses machine learning to do these calculations in under a minute. Instead of using the physics-based equations, it bases its predictions on four decades of historical weather data. GraphCast uses graph neural networks, which map Earth&#x27;s surface into more than a million grid points. At each grid point, the model predicts the temperature, wind speed and direction, and mean sea-level pressure, as well as other conditions like humidity. The neural network is then able to find patterns and draw conclusions about what will happen next for each of these data points.

The company shared it has added iMessage to its newest phone through a new &quot;Nothing Chats&quot; app powered by the messaging platform Sunbird. From a report: The feature will be available to users in North America, the EU, and other European countries starting this Friday, November 17th. Nothing writes on its page that it&#x27;s doing this because &quot;messaging services are dividing phone users,&quot; and it wants &quot;to break those barriers down.&quot; But doing so here requires you to trust Sunbird. Nothing&#x27;s FAQ says Sunbird&#x27;s &quot;architecture provides a system to deliver a message from one user to another without ever storing it at any point in its journey,&quot; and that messages aren&#x27;t stored on its servers. 

Marques Brownlee has also had a preview of Nothing Chats. He confirmed with Nothing that, similar to how other iMessage-to-Android bridge services have worked before, &quot;...it&#x27;s literally signing in on some Mac Mini in a server farm somewhere, and that Mac Mini will then do all of the routing for you to make this happen.&quot; Nothing&#x27;s US head of PR, Jane Nho, told The Verge in an email that Sunbird stores user iCloud credentials as a token &quot;in an encrypted database&quot; and associated with one of its Mac Minis in the US or Europe, depending on the user&#x27;s location, that then act as a relay for iMessages sent via the app. She added that, after two weeks of inactivity, Sunbird deletes the account information.

                              <span>An anonymous reader writes: Videos collected by 404 Media over months give a peek into the world of spoofing numbers, automated call scripts, and a specific seller of the phones. From the report: &quot;Alright lads,&quot; a man sitting in the passenger seat of a moving car says in a heavy British accent. In his left hand he holds a special phone he is showing off to his clients, while with the other he films his demonstration which was later uploaded to Telegram. &quot;I&#x27;m only going to say it once, yeah. You swipe, and it&#x27;s gone,&quot; he continues, demonstrating one app installed that can instantly destroy data stored on the device. The phone in question is one from &quot;Russiancoms,&quot; an underground outfit that sells the devices for just under $2,000 each. For that price, customers get a laundry list of features: the ability to spoof phone numbers, play hold music, and have a computerized voice read pre-determined scripts. While Russiancoms does not acknowledge in its Telegram channel what the phones might really be for, those are features well suited to committing fraud. 

The Russiancoms Telegram channel periodically deletes its videos and other messages, but 404 Media has been archiving many of them for months. They provide insight into a little known industry of fraud phones, ones that make it easy for anyone to enter the world of robocalling or other scams. While much of the underground phone industry has been focused on providing secure communications to criminals -- companies like Phantom Secure, Encrochat, and Sky for example -- Russiancoms and similar companies appear to cater to a different use case: enabling people to make calls that fraudulently appear to come from someone else. A common tool in the underground is also so-called Russian SIMs, which can spoof numbers in some cases. Russiancoms&#x27; phones, however, are more fully featured.

                              <span>The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has struggled to stop a hyper-aggressive cybercrime gang that&#x27;s been tormenting corporate America over the last two years, according to nine cybersecurity responders, digital crime experts and victims. Reuters: For more than six months, the FBI has known the identities of at least a dozen members tied to the hacking group responsible for the devastating September break-ins at casino operators MGM Resorts International and Caesars Entertainment, according to four people familiar with the investigation. Industry executives have told Reuters they were baffled by an apparent lack of arrests despite many of the hackers being based in America. &quot;I would love for somebody to explain it to me,&quot; said Michael Sentonas, president of CrowdStrike, one of the firms leading the response effort to the hacks. 

&quot;For such a small group, they are absolutely causing havoc,&quot; Sentonas told Reuters in an interview last month. Sentonas said the hackers were &quot;known&quot; but didn&#x27;t provide specifics. He did say, &quot;I think there is a failure here.&quot; Asked who was responsible for the failure, Sentonas said, &quot;law enforcement.&quot; [...] Dubbed by some security professionals as &quot;Scattered Spider,&quot; the hacking group has been active since 2021 but it grabbed headlines following a series of intrusions at several high profile American companies.

                              <span>AI could be used to predict if a person is at risk of having a heart attack up to 10 years in the future, a study has found. From a report: The technology could save thousands of lives while improving treatment for almost half of patients, researchers at the University of Oxford said. The study, funded by the British Heart Foundation (BHF), looked at how AI might improve the accuracy of cardiac CT scans, which are used to detect blockages or narrowing in the arteries. 

Prof Charalambos Antoniades, chair of cardiovascular medicine at the BHF and director of the acute multidisciplinary imaging and interventional centre at Oxford, said: &quot;Our study found that some patients presenting in hospital with chest pain -- who are often reassured and sent back home -- are at high risk of having a heart attack in the next decade, even in the absence of any sign of disease in their heart arteries. Here we demonstrated that providing an accurate picture of risk to clinicians can alter, and potentially improve, the course of treatment for many heart patients.&quot; 

About 350,000 people in the UK have a CT scan each year but, according to the BHF, many patients later die of heart attacks due to their failure in picking up small, undetectable narrowings. Researchers analysed the data of more than 40,000 patients undergoing routine cardiac CT scans at eight UK hospitals, with a median follow-up time of 2.7 years. The AI tool was tested on a further 3,393 patients over almost eight years and was able to accurately predict the risk of a heart attack. AI-generated risk scores were then presented to medics for 744 patients, with 45% having their treatment plans altered by medics as a result.

We wanted to share an update on what the Council has been working on since our last update.
Accomplishments so far
We have elected new project directors!
Through the great work of the Project Director Election Process Committee,
we have defined a process for selecting Project Directors for the Rust Foundation Board of Directors.
We carried out the process, and recently announced the new directors.
We will be following up with a retrospective to identify what went well and what can be improved,
and feed those improvements back into the process for next year.
We have established a new home for Project governance documentation at https://forge.rust-lang.org/governance/index.html.
As changes to the governance policies are accepted via the RFC proce…</span>

                              <span>I can&#x27;t thank Honeypot and Carolina Cabral enough for the producing The Rails Documentary that was just released today. Looking back on those early, formative years of Ruby on Rails with Tobi, Jamis, Jeremy, and Jason was actually kind of profound. I usually don&#x27;t spend much time looking back, so for once to stop and marvel at how we got started twenty years ago was really special. A fitting tribute to two decades of working with Ruby on the web.
Together with 37signals, Rails has been my life&#x27;s work. I&#x27;ve had the pleasure to collaborate with literally thousands of people on evolving the framework, and I&#x27;ve been humbled to see well over a million applications be built with it. Everything from tiny internal apps to $77 billion behemoths like Shopify.
Now one of the reasons I don&#x27;t spend too…</span>

                              <span>The Rust compiler&#x27;s front-end can now use parallel execution to significantly
reduce compile times. To try it, run the nightly compiler with the -Z threads&#x3D;8 option. This feature is currently experimental, and we aim to ship
it in the stable compiler in 2024.
Keep reading to learn why a parallel front-end is needed and how it works, or
just skip ahead to the How to use it
section.
Compile times and parallelism
Rust compile times are a perennial concern. The Compiler Performance Working
Group
has continually improved compiler performance for several years. For example,
in the first 10 months of 2023, there were mean reductions in compile time of
13%,
in peak memory use of
15%,
and in binary size of
7%,
as measured by our performance suite.

Here’s the 16th installment of my popular Heard Something, Read Something, Saw Something series.
So, what do we have this time...
Heard Something
Lately I&#x27;ve been enjoying listening to discussions about free will. Do we have it? If so, how much? Always? Sometimes? Never? Is it real or an illusion? I find the concept fascinating. One of my favorite recent conversations (debates?) about the topic was between Russ Roberts and Robert Sapolsky on Robert&#x27;s EconTalk podcast. Listen in. 
Hear it: https://www.econtalk.org/robert-sapolsky-on-determinism-free-will-and-responsibility/
Read Something
Every once in a while you read something that swirls with someone’s body of work and undeniably signals they definitively know what the fuck they’re doing. This is that, by Jonathan Hoefler.
Read it: https://typography.com/blog/text-for-proofing-fonts
Saw Something
Driving Dreams is a wonderful documentary on the golden age of Italian automotive design. Full of colorful characters, poetic stories, and the celebration of an art form — and approach — that&#x27;s now long gone. Well worth the 52 minutes.
See it: https://www.amazon.com/Driving-Dreams-Gianluca-Migliarotti/dp/B07455DCH7/
Until next time.

                              <span>As React UI controls become more sophisticated, complex logic can get
     intertwined with the visual representation. This makes it hard to reason
     about the behavior of the component, hard to test it, and necessary to
     build similar components that need a different look. Juntao
     Qiu tackles this by using a Headless Component, which
     extracts all non-visual logic and state management, separating the brain of
     a component from its looks.
