                              <span>Since the beginning of Basecamp, we’ve been loath to make promises about future product improvements. We’ve always wanted customers to judge the product they could buy and use today, not some imaginary version that might exist in the future.
It’s why we’ve never committed to a product road map. It’s not because we have a secret one in the back of some smoky room we don’t want to share, but because one doesn’t actually exist. We honestly don’t know what we’ll be working on in a year, so why act like we do?
But when we recently launched an all-new version of Basecamp, we ended up making a promise about the future anyway. D’oh.
See, a new version didn’t initially include a feature our customers were clamoring for: Project templates. The requests piled in, the emails piled up. We wanted to do …</span>

                              <span>Google will eventually kill every single service you care about, if they can&#x27;t find a way to directly monetize it with ads at a scale of billions. They&#x27;re institutionally incapable of being in the product or service business, because neither products nor services butter Google&#x27;s bread. Advertisement does.
You can see this emphasis in a myriad of ways, but my favorite lens is customer service. Google has always been uniquely awful when it comes to customer service, because helping someone with a problem on Workspaces or even the Google Cloud Platform was never going to be as profitable as helping an advertiser carpet bomb your attention span.
This is an evergreen observation, but I&#x27;m bringing it up in celebration of Google killing their domain name registrar Google Domains just now. After nine years in business, it&#x27;ll unceremoniously get obliterated in just three months (and the shrapnel sold to Squarespace). That was a $180m/year business, servicing 10 million domains!
It&#x27;s no better in the dead-business-walking department of Google Home / Nest. Google bought Nest almost a decade ago, and has managed to do worse than nothing with its product portfolio since. Just a few years ago they killed Nest Secure, leaving anyone who bought into that system with a bundle of bricks next year. And the Google Home app that was supposed to take over from the superior Nest app has been a multi-year stumble of embarrassment and neglect.
With a history like this, why would anyone trust Google on products and services outsides of the ad space? This goes from Workspaces to Gmail for Domains to even the Google Cloud Platform. This company is one major reorganization or recently promoted executive away from murdering any of these.
All I&#x27;m saying is you better have a backup plan. Be that for your collaboration, your email, your home security system. Anything that reads &quot;Made by Google&quot; implicitly has the subscript &quot;until we don&#x27;t give a fuck any more&quot; printed below.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s hard to think original thoughts if your senses are being perpetually flooded with everything from everyone all the time. And it&#x27;s hard to protect your senses against this if you&#x27;re constantly in close mental proximity to those who&#x27;ve had success running the established script. To escape back to first principles, you need to consciously turn down the volume on the world.
I credit much of the novel work we&#x27;ve done on product development, organizational design, and software tooling at 37signals with being far removed from the centers of Silicon Valley. Physically, spiritually, and mentally. Right from the start.
Being in Chicago in those early years of the post-dot-com-bust internet was like living in a monastery. We knew there was a party going on a hundred miles inland, but the debauchery was never so close as to color our thinking or tempt our aspirations. We were geographically destined to see the world in a different light.
This was before social media. When much of Silicon Valley&#x27;s propaganda had to be carried by monthly magazines and the occasionally breathless mainstream story. Which made it so much easier to tune out. Now it&#x27;s more work.
It takes concerted effort these days to escape the AI FOMO fest, say. Like it required fortitude to resist the fear of missing out on the latest coin hype before that. Every feed is there to homogenize your thinking into a preconfigured camp. For or against, hype or denounce. These are all just plusses and minuses in front of the same thinking.
If you want more than this, you ought to embrace the paradox that there are times when the less you know raises the bar for what you can do. Don&#x27;t drown out our inner drumbeat by living all your days inside the permanent intellectual festival of your profession.</span>

The situation was parsing and storing parsed fields in a struct. Each
field name that is parsed should match up to a struct field.
This is a fairly common problem. So this post walks through how to use
Zig&#x27;s metaprogramming features in a simpler but related domain:
parsing CSS into typed objects, and pretty-printing these typed CSS

                              <span>Abilities unused will atrophy, so putting in anything less than your best means giving up on what you’re capable of. You can’t save talent or energy for better days, only watch it go to waste. This is a hard truth to accept if you don’t think your company has earned your best.


And companies make employees feel like that all the time. This is part of what drives the whole “act your wage” rebellion. Why should you put in your best if work never seems to return the favor? It’s a perfectly human response of spite in the face of unfairness, but you can’t avenge your grievances by squandering your potential.


The years will wash away quickly. If you wait for the perfect company to reveal your peak potential, it may never come. Or by the time it does come, you’re not ready, because you’re no longer who you were. You let it slip. That’s a tragedy.


Whatever the situation, whatever the company, you should show up with your very best. Not for them, but for you. Use the discontent to become better, then bolt to another camp when the opportunity presents itself.


Besides, you’ll appreciate a good place so much more if you’ve made it through some bad places.


Don’t play yourself by living down to their expectations. Show yourself the path out by shining bright whatever the weather.</span>

                              <span>Mobile applications often deliver features rapidly at first, but slow as
     a codebase builds up. These common software problems are exacerbated by the
     need to prioritize different features in different markets. Matthew
     Foster describes an example of this from his work with clients,
     and how using Domain-Driven Design and Team Topologies helped create a
     modular architecture that substantially reduced the time needed to deliver

                              <span>I didn&#x27;t get into the race car until two in the morning. By then, the rollercoaster that is the 24 Hours of Le Mans had already been going for ten hours. Oh, and we were a lap down on the leaders in our class. Doh!
I&#x27;ve never had the race go that long before getting into the car. Usually by midnight, I&#x27;ll have driven at least a good two hours of the required minimum six. But this edition of Le Mans also had more drama than any of the previous nine attempts I&#x27;ve been part of. At the end of the race, 22 cars had retired from crashes or mechanical issues, and several more were limping home many laps down. It was mayhem.
Which started right from the words green, green, green. By the first chicane down the Mulsanne straight, a Cadillac in the class above us crashed hard immediately in front of …</span>

As with every complex subject, people – me included – love to reduce it to a dichotomy. A binary choice where you can either be right or wrong. I&#x27;m in the camp of remote-work-is-the-best, but I can&#x27;t deny that many folks and companies thrive with on-site work. Plenty of evidence backing up any side you want to take here.


What always surprises me is that most assume that existing companies have a choice. Generally speaking, I don&#x27;t think they do. If a company obtaining good results isn&#x27;t working remotely already, it will likely fail to switch…</span>

                              <span>Hey there!
Here’s the 15th installment of my popular Heard Something, Read Something, Saw Something series.
So, what do we have this time...
Heard Something
These 11 minutes will restore your faith in humanity. A student pilot loses her front nose gear on takeoff on her 3rd solo flight ever. An incredible amount of support comes in over the radio from the tower and fellow pilots, helping her keep her calm and eventually land safely. Heartwarming all around. Just listen.
Hear it: https://youtu.be/USW53vdL_0c
Read Something
Here’s a great piece on paying it backward. From music to sports to movies, Matt shares some great examples of younger, “hotter” talents shining a light on someone they’d long respected to help elevate them in the public consciousness.
Read it: https://mattruby.substack.com/p/pay-it-backward-?r&#x3D;7wjyf
Saw Something
“Whoever came up with this superb bit of creativity at Target, I salute you.” You kinda wonder if it was put up this way, or if a customer did the deed. Regardless, clever!
See it: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6951158945868599296/?utm_source&#x3D;linkedin_share&amp;utm_medium&#x3D;member_desktop_web

                              <span>The internet&#x27;s a living, breathing, professional self-help platform. If advice on how to run your company isn&#x27;t coming at you 280 characters at a time on Twitter, you can hear it on a podcast, read it on a Substack, or get it right here on your LinkedIn feed. There&#x27;s hardly a CEO, an entrepreneur, or a cultural figure these days who doesn&#x27;t profess to hold some wisdom that will lead you to building a great business.
I don&#x27;t think this proliferation of expertise is a particularly useful development. It&#x27;s overwhelming and often contradicting. It&#x27;s hard to know what&#x27;s worth knowing when you don&#x27;t know in the first place.
So rather than give you advice on how to take advice, I thought I&#x27;d share my personal approach to filtering it.
Whenever I get advice, I first find out if the person giving i…</span>

This experiment convinced millions of employees of how much better life could be without a commute or even having to live by the office, but also left uneasy the legions of managers whose skills and mindsets were anchored in the office.
This reversal plot is know as hybrid work, and combines the worst of in-office and remote work worlds. The shrewd – but likely temporary – concession here is starting with three days in the office, two from home. By starting like this, managers who have no interest in remote work at all can claim to have &quot;compromised&quot;, dulling the urge to revolt. Then …</span>

                              <span>What an interesting moment.
We&#x27;re staring at two distinctly different visions of the future. They may co-exist, but they are radically different takes on what&#x27;s modern, what&#x27;s current, and where things are headed.
One vision gets the UI out of the way. The other vision is UI everywhere you look.
One vision gets the computer out of the way. The other vision mounts a computer on your face.
One vision is get it and go. One vision is get it and stay.
One vision fades into the background. The other vision is front and center.
One vision is about information. The other vision is about immersion.
One vision is natural and understands you. The other vision requires new methods of interaction that you have to learn and master.
One vision feels like an assist. One vision feels like obstruction.
One vision fits with whatever you already have. One vision requires you buy something that fits.
One vision is simply text. One vision is anything but.
One vision feels like before. One vision feels like after. But I&#x27;m not sure which is which.
Both are extraordinary.

And it&#x27;s a paradoxical one with several counterintuitive corollaries. Here&#x27;s one: if you don&#x27;t understand what you need to build, you should start building it. And here&#x27;s another: sweating to build something just to hit the delete button is sometimes part of the process.


Writing and making code work is costly; thinking and discussing things in the abstract is cheap. Everything holds up on paper, but computers are picky. I don’t believe that LLMs – as revolutionary as they are – will change this imbalance soon. Spending…</span>

                              <span>Companies love to protect.
They protect their brand with trademarks and lawsuits. They protect their data and trade secrets with rules, policies, and NDAs. They protect their money with budgets, CFOs, and investments.
They guard so many things, but all too often they fail to protect what’s both most vulnerable and precious: their employees’ time and attention.
Companies spend their employees’ time and attention as if there was an infinite supply of both. As if they cost nothing. Yet employees’ time and attention are among the scarcest resources we have.
At 37signals, we see it as our top job to protect our employees’ time and attention. You can’t expect people to do great work if they don’t have a full day’s attention to devote to it. Partial attention is barely attention at all.

                              <span>Today, we meet Ben Dumke-von der Ehe, one of the early developers on the Stack Overflow team. 
 He was on the front lines as the platform transformed how programmers worked. And he embodies the spirit of Stack Overflow:  Its transparency, playfulness, and even some of its struggles to be as welcoming and friendly as it should be. 
  
 But you&#x27;ll see what I mean. 
  
 So stick around as Ben takes us on a journey through the building of Stack Overflow. Get ready for a candid inside look at the creation of a platform that would become an essential part of the developer community and the internet as we know it.

                              <span>When I went to school in the 80s and 90s, the communication between the institution and home was limited. Kids could bring home a flyer about some future event, they&#x27;d get their grades and remarks detailed in a little grey book, and once a year parents would come in for a chat with the teachers. That was basically it, and it was glorious.
In Denmark today, we have a centralized app used by all Danish public schools called Aula. Think of it as Facebook for teachers and parents. For our kid in an international school, there&#x27;s a similar system. All of it sucks. And I don&#x27;t mean in the way that the apps are poorly made, although that is typically also true, but in the way that adding IT to the parent-school relationship only made it worse.

But the natural inclination is to promote senior contributors up a managerial ladder, and out of the trenches. This often ends poorly, turning the promotion into a punishment.
It&#x27;s usually not that these potential managers don&#x27;t like working with others. Quite the contrary. I&#x27;ve found that nothing motivates ambitious people like working close together with other talented individuals. It&#x27;s also usually not that they&#x27;re uncomfortable being senior, in terms of setting a direction for the work. It&#x27;s that they don&#x27;t want the responsibility, and associated guilt, that comes with managing others. Especially when there&#x27;s a need for correction.

This doesn&#x27;t mean leaving them all alone to figure out the culture, the work, and the people by themselves, mind you. Nobody hits the ground running, and everyone needs guidance and mentorship to thrive in a new situation. But it does mean that the context in which you offer that assistance ought to be real as quickly as possible.
For programmers at 37signals, for example, we assign both a buddy and a mentor to new hires. The buddy is solely there to be a friendly guide to the innards of the organization. Why do we do the things we do? The mentor is there…</span>

                              <span>Making data open and available to all helps us all understand our world
     and are thus better informed to shape the policies to run it. But such openness
     does come with problems - one in particular is the invasion of people&#x27;s
     privacy. Detailed census information about household income helps debate
     and planning for local government, but can reveal personal information that
     citizens reasonably prefer to keep private. Privacy Enhancing Technologies
     are tools that can finesse this problem. My colleague Katharine Jarmul is a
     data scientist who is also an activist for personal privacy. Here she
     introduces three of these tools that are usable now: Differential Privacy,
     Distributed &amp; Federated Analysis &amp; Learning, and Encrypted Computation.

                              <span>In all the years we ran 360 performance reviews – the employee assessment process where you solicit feedback from peers, reports, and manager – I can think of only once when it lead to a meaningful follow-up. The rest of the time, across hundreds of reviews, it was an arduous, awkward affair of forcing people to come up with novel ways to congratulate each other on command. Dropping these 360s was perhaps one of the most popular acts of minimizing management we&#x27;ve ever done at 37signals.
It should have been obvious that the 360 process wasn&#x27;t valuable because almost nobody wanted to do it. Getting folks to fill out their reviews required constant nagging, resulting in weeks-long procrastination. That is not the hallmark of a happy process that serves the interests of the people involved.

They were invited to give a keynote at the conference, only to be told two weeks later the keynote would be demoted to a normal talk, due to a decision made within the Rust project leadership.
That decision was not right, and first off we want to publicly apologize for the harm we caused. We failed you JeanHeyd. The idea of downgrading a talk after the invitation was insulting, and nobody in leadership should have been willing to entertain it.
Everyone in leadership chat is still working to fully figure out everything that went wrong and how we can prevent all of this from happening again. That work is not finished yet. Still, we want to share some steps we are taking to reduce the risk of something…</span>

                              <span>If you want to run a company that&#x27;s light on full-time managers, you have to focus on managing processes before people. The traditional paradigm of a reporting manager that&#x27;s constantly following up with their reports, conducting daily stand-up meetings, weekly 1-1s, and all other forms of intensive supervision, needs to be (mostly) replaced with an asynchronous, self-managing paradigm instead.
Let&#x27;s look at five ways that principle works in practice at 37signals. 
First, we&#x27;ve replaced the commonly used daily stand-up meetings with a set of automated questions in Basecamp. On Monday mornings, we ask everyone &quot;What are you going to work on this week?&quot;, and at the end of every day, we ask &quot;What did you work on today?&quot;. These two recurring questions provide the key process for keeping everyo…</span>

                              <span>Developers commonly ask &quot;what framework should we use for dependency
     injection&quot;. Daniel Somerfield explains why this is the wrong question,
     instead we should focus how to have clearly separated modules with a simple
     composition mechanism between them. He illustrates how he approaches this
     in TypeScript, with a minimalist &quot;function-first&quot; approach, on a simple
     example application separating application logic from persistence.

All useful calculations, but I can&#x27;t tell you what bliss it&#x27;s been to steer 37signals without them for twenty years.
That&#x27;s not to say that we never run these numbers, but it is to say that these numbers never run us. Because in the end, even the most sophisticated KPIs all inevitably serve the simplest calculations: Are we making money? Is it enough? You don&#x27;t need a degree in statistics to determine that.
Where this is most evident for us is in the product. I remember reading a story about how Google once tested 127 different shades of blue…</span>
