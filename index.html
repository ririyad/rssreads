Sacrificing purity for convenience is one of the Rails pillars. This principle informs several Rails features that some recommend avoiding but that we happily use in our apps. In this post, I’ll discuss how we use three of those in Basecamp.

I’ll show some examples involving projects. In Basecamp, a Bucket represents a top-level container of data, and there are several types of buckets, one of which is a Project. Internally, we implement this with delegated type attribute, where a Bucket has an associated Bucketable. A Bucket can contain many Events, and an Event is a holder for information on the related request, such as the IP or the transaction id (Event::Request) and some additional information (Event::Detail).

     that helped them find a product/market fit lead to excessive costs once
     traffic increases. These costs can threaten a scaleup&#x27;s ability to grow.
     Sofia Tania and Stefania Stefansdottir have worked with
     many scaleups in this predicament and share their approach to understanding

                              <span>Birgitta Böckeler continues her explorations in using
     LLMs, this time by asking GitHub Copilot to write a median
     function. It gave her three suggestions to choose from. The
     experience shows you still have to know what you&#x27;re doing when asking LLMs
     to write code, since the LLM&#x27;s programming skills are often rather flawed.

Scarcely a month goes by without some action triggering the incessant bells of doom, ringing from the bellies of bloviating ding dongs. And the ringing seemingly never stops long enough to allow for some basic contemplation or correction, as reality wrecks another prediction of peril.


But the obsession with all things Elon is so strong that there’s no room or time for introspection of any kind. It’s just on to the next faux outrage of tomorrow.

And it&#x27;s even bigger than before the pandemic, now that so many workers have had a taste of what life can be like when you don&#x27;t have to commute to the office. This is great news for smaller companies and startups in particular.
Let&#x27;s face it, if you&#x27;re trying to compete for talent with the likes of Google or Apple, you need all the help you can get, and these companies forcing everyone back into an office might just be your biggest lift. Because for quite a few people, working remotely or not has become the defining characteristic of a job. To the point where many remote workers won&#x27;t even consider a position th…</span>

    company, requires a lot of people - and whenever you have a lot of people
    you have to figure out how to divide them into effective teams. Forming
    Business Capability Centric teams helps software efforts to
    be responsive to customers’ needs, but the range of skills required often
    overwhelms such teams. Team Topologies is a model
    for describing the organization of software development teams,
    developed by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais. It defines four forms
    of teams and three modes of team
    interactions. The model encourages healthy interactions that allow 
    business-capability centric teams to flourish in their task of providing a
    steady flow of valuable software.

  that fully supports software for a particular business capability. The term
  became popular as it used to describe how Amazon organized their software staff.
The name suggests the most obvious aspect of such teams, their size. The
  name comes from the principle that the team should no larger than can be fed
  with two pizzas. (Although we are talking about American Pizzas here, which
  seemed alarmingly huge when I first encountered them over here.) Keeping a
  team small keeps it cohesive, forming tight working relationships. Typically I
  hear this means such teams are about 5-8 people, although my experience
  suggests that the upper limit is somewhere about 15.
Although the name focuses solely on the size, just as important is the

                              <span>After hiring people for twenty years, I&#x27;ve come to accept that it&#x27;s impossible to know up front what someone is truly capable of. Sure, we try our best to make good, educated guesses during the hiring process, and this is why asking finalists to do sample work projects is so crucial. But it still remains just guessing, and the truth doesn&#x27;t emerge until you afford the hire a full attempt on a real project.
That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m such a fan of starting new employees in the deep end. Putting them to work on a real project right away. But this is only half the commitment you ought to make to their potential.
It&#x27;s just as important to retain the possibility of rapid progression by continuing to test their promise against harder and bigger challenges. I can&#x27;t tell you the number of times I&#x27;ve been posi…</span>

                              <span>Hello again from the Rust Leadership Council. In our first blog post, we laid out several immediate goals for the council and promised to report back on their progress. It has been about a month since our first update so we wanted to share how it&#x27;s going and what we&#x27;re working on now.
Accomplishments so far
In our first post, we wrote:
In the coming weeks we will be establishing the basic infrastructure for the group, including creating a plan for regular meetings and a process for raising agenda items, setting up a team repository, and ultimately completing the transition from the former Rust leadership structures.
We have made progress on each of these things.
For the last month we have been holding weekly meetings and will continue to do so for at least the next month. In the long term,…</span>

                              <span>The easiest way to squander your focus is by paying attention to a million inconsequential things at once. These little mental barnacles add up in imperceptible ways until you suddenly feel like you&#x27;re getting nowhere, no matter how hard you push. You must keep scrubbing your mind clear of such attention-sapping colonies to remain capable of making smooth, swift progress.
These barnacles can accumulate from middling marketing initiatives, process theatre, and tolerance for mediocre performance. All individually presenting as more hassle to deal with than to dismiss, but combined killing the efficiency and focus on progress.
But they can also be things that actually appears to be working well enough, just not up to the bar of your very best. Those are the tricky ones. The base hits, the modest accomplishments, the things you might even have celebrated once. The past darlings.
It just doesn&#x27;t matter. You can&#x27;t keep stuffing your head with ever more things to pay partial attention to every month and expect to keep a clear eye on the horizon and the future. There&#x27;s only room for so much.
The hardest part about this is not to wait until it&#x27;s too much, until the drag is actually there. Keep your mind below carrying capacity, such that there&#x27;s room for serendipity, at all times.
In short, be decisive about what you&#x27;ll no longer do. Summon your inner Jack Welch to cut at least the bottom 10% of the stuff dragging your attention every few months or so.</span>

Summary
On 2023-07-20 between 12:17 and 12:30 UTC all crate downloads from crates.io were broken due to a deployment that contained a bug in the download URL generation.
During this time we had an average of 4.71K requests per second to crates.io, resulting in about 3.7M failed requests, including the retry attempts from cargo.
The incident was noticed by the developer triggering the production deployment after seeing elevated request-per-second numbers in our monitoring dashboard after the deployment. At this point the root cause for the elevated numbers was not clear yet, but a community member notified the developer via Zulip.
Immediately after the notification, the broken deployment was rolled back to the pre…</span>

                              <span>So much talk about hacking productivity these days. There’s an endless stream of methodologies and tools promising to make you more productive. But more productive at what?
Productivity is for machines, not for people. There’s nothing meaningful about packing some number of work units into some amount of time or squeezing more into less.
Machines can work 24/7; humans can’t.
When people focus on productivity, they end up focusing on being busy. Filling every moment with something to do. And there’s always more to do!
We don’t believe in busyness at Basecamp. We believe in effectiveness. How little can we do? How much can we cut out? Instead of adding to-dos, we add to-don’ts.
Being productive is about occupying your time—filling your schedule to the brim and getting as much as you can. Being effective is about finding more of your time unoccupied and open for other things besides work. Time for leisure, time for family and friends. Or time for doing absolutely nothing.
Yes, it’s perfectly okay to have nothing to do. Or, better yet, nothing worth doing. If you’ve only got three hours of work to do on a given day, then stop. Don’t fill your day with five more just to stay busy or feel productive. Not doing something that isn’t worth doing is a wonderful way to spend your time.

                              <span>Getting anything new off the ground usually requires a tremendous amount of urgency. It&#x27;s hard to launch something  from nothing into reality without being incredibly impatient for progress. Thus most founders begin 🎶Their Journey🎶 sprinting from one pressing problem to the next in rapid succession to achieve their lift off. But reaching escape velocity doesn&#x27;t guarantee you&#x27;ll keep going, unless you retain the propulsion from an unreasonable sense of urgency.
Yet the irony of being successful in business is that it&#x27;ll invariably attract smart people who can tell you all the good reasons for why you can no longer go as quickly as you once did. Why it&#x27;s actually natural, perhaps even good, that a company ten or a hundred times the size of what it was when it first became successful now has to travel at half the pace to be prudent.
Don&#x27;t listen too closely. Not because they&#x27;ll be wrong in any narrow technical sense, but because they&#x27;re wrong in the broad directional sense. The risk of succumbing to the rigor mortis of success is usually far greater than the risk of making a mistake by not considering and mitigating all possible bad outcomes up front.
It&#x27;s the risk of mandating everyone put on a bike helmet, only to realize that doing so means fewer people will bike, leading to worse health outcomes for all. Being obsessive about specific, short-term risks often sits in opposition to worrying about fuzzy, long-term risks.
And nobody will be as motivated as a founder to inject risk into the business. Sticking with an unreasonable sense of urgency undoubtedly comes with clear and immediate risks. But giving up on it with even worse, less defined ones.
So don&#x27;t give up. Every company needs to have someone asking why we can&#x27;t launch next Monday instead of next month. Willing to accept and underwrite the risks needed to make it happen. And with a stomach for occasionally being wrong, eating the loss, but keep playing.</span>

                              <span>Anyone reviewing their S&amp;P 500 retirement fund these days will do so with a broader smile than last year. The market as a whole is up, and if you&#x27;re in the whole market, you&#x27;re benefitting. But all of that upside, basically, belongs to just a handful of mega tech companies. 
This is not a general turn-around, and it&#x27;s barely a turn-around at all for the unprofitable SaaS companies that saw their bubble burst last year. In software, only cash spigots like Apple and Microsoft are able to set fresh all-time highs. Investors who bought into money pits like Asana, Monday, or Smartsheet are still likely to be in despair over their evaporated values.

                              <span>Platform teams have a unique reliance on other teams to ensure adoption
     of their platform - getting code changes into other teams&#x27; codebase is
     critical to their success. Pete Hodgson structures how
     platform teams collaborate into phases
     of migration, consumption, and evolution. He describes what&#x27;s different in
     each of these phases, the operating models to adopt, and which cross-team
     collaboration patterns work best.

                              <span>It&#x27;s common to see a centralized architecture function that sets
     standards and oversees development projects. Such teams often suffer from
     being far removed from the issues of implementation with long
     feedback loops that slow down the flow of work. To counter these problems,
     many organizations have explored a decentralized approach to yield
     alignment between teams without these problems. One such organization is
     Xapo bank, which did this using ideas taken from Domain-Driven Design, Team
     Topologies, and the Architectural Advice Process.

                              <span>What you see above is a 17-day sales sequence, or cadence. A friend of mine just sent it over and it creeped me out.
From email to LinkedIn to phone to email back to LinkedIn back to phone, and so on. I assume day 18 would be a bullhorn outside your window.
Somehow this is allowed to be called sales. But in any other realm it would be called stalking.
The sales industry calls these moments &quot;touches&quot;, which is even creepier. And then, check out that last one: The break up email. Ouch.
Imagine if you ran this playbook when trying to sell yourself in a new relationship (or save yourself in a failing one). You meet someone new, and you contact them 15 times in a variety of ways over 17 days. And sometimes multiple times a day after they&#x27;ve already ignored your earlier attempts. They&#x27;d be right in calling the cops and getting a restraining order.
I know this isn&#x27;t how sales always works, but it&#x27;s prevalent enough. I&#x27;ve been on the receiving end before. It&#x27;s just wrong, even if it &quot;works&quot; sometimes.
Clean up in aisle sales! Something&#x27;s broken.

                              <span>As announced in the Types Team announcement post at the start of this year, the Types Team has started to reimplement the trait solver of rustc. This refactor is similar to Chalk, but directly integrated into the existing codebase using the experience gathered over the last few years. Unlike Chalk, the new trait solver has the sole goal of replacing the existing implementation. We are separately working on formalizing the type system in a-mir-formality. It has now been half a year since that announcement which matches the first step of our roadmap.
By reimplementing the trait solver of rustc we are able to fix many subtle bugs and inefficiencies of the existing implementation. This should result in faster compilation speed and fewer bugs. The new trait solver implementation should also unb…</span>

Charging credit cards wasn&#x27;t easy in the early 2000s. This was back when being an &quot;internet company&quot; was a major red flag. The process required mounds of paperwork, proof, and business model scrutiny just to get approved. Barely capable, ancient APIs sorta kinda let you hook into internal systems. Charging a card successfully felt like a miracle. You had no idea. It wasn&#x27;t years later until companies like Stripe made it simple.
While you were never really happy with the service, you had to have it. And switching to another service meant going through the whole ungainly process again. And the grass was probably browner.

                              <span>There&#x27;s so much chatter and advice out there about how to handle &quot;the competition&quot;.
How much should you worry about them, what you can do to beat them, how much should you pay attention to what they&#x27;re doing, how you should respond when they release or say something new, what you should say when a customer compares you to them, etc.
Essentially, lots of they&#x27;s and them&#x27;s.
Of course you compete in a market with multiple options, but that&#x27;s not your real competition.
Your real competition are your costs. Yours, not theirs. You, not them.
You ultimately stay in business when you make more money than you spend. The amount you make depends on a number of factors, many surprisingly far outside your control.
But one of the few controls you have in business is cost control. Bills don&#x27;t materialize…</span>

Do open source / don’t do it.

Have children / don’t have them. 
Work long hours / never put in an extra hour.
Small and risky / large and secure.
Work for others / work for yourself.
Work out of passion / work to pay the bills. 


Those are examples of dichotomies that enter my radar from time to time. Usually, someone criticizes someone else’s position after performing some intellectual judo to vilify it.


Whenever I see people telling others how to live, I can’t help wondering: isn’t figuring out what works for you already difficult enough?

                              <span>The regex sub-team is announcing the release of regex 1.9. The regex crate
is maintained by the Rust project and is the recommended way to use regular
expressions in Rust. Its defining characteristic is its guarantee of worst case
linear time searches with respect to the size of the string being searched.
Releases of the regex crate aren&#x27;t normally announced on this blog, but
since the majority of its internals have been rewritten in version 1.9, this
announcement serves to encourage extra scrutiny. If you run into any problems
or performance regressions, please report them on the issue tracker or ask
questions on the Discussion forum.
Few API additions have been made, but one worth calling out is the
Captures::extract method that should make getting capture groups in some
cases more convenient. Otherwise, the main change folks should see is hopefully
faster search times.
You can read more in the CHANGELOG and in a more in depth blog post on
regex crate internals as a library.</span>

 Have you ever been frustrated with your whole life? The daily grind has taken what you love and it just doesn&#x27;t feel the same anymore. Some of the magic just has slowly faded away. You don&#x27;t know when it started, but it did. 
 Today&#x27;s guest is Amir Rajan. He&#x27;s hard to describe. 
   
 Is he a developer? Yes. An artist who sold everything that he owned for indie game development. Yes. The subject of a New Yorker profile? Yes, all of that. And also, somebody who got frustrated with his life and left everything behind.
