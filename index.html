                              <span>Aaron Gordon writes via Motherboard: Kia and Hyundai say it is not their fault that their cars are being stolen in an unprecedented theft surge made possible by the vehicles lacking a basic anti-theft technology virtually every other car has, according to a recent court filing. Instead, the companies point the finger at social media companies, such as TikTok and Instagram, where instructions on how to steal the cars have been widely shared and thieves show off their stolen cars.
 
The lawyers representing the two corporations -- which are owned by the same parent company -- are not subtle about this argument. The filing (PDF) -- in which the company is arguing a roughly $200 million class-action settlement ought to be approved by the court -- includes an entire section heading titled &quot;Social Media and Intervening Third-Party Criminals Caused An Unprecedented Increase In Thefts.&quot; The lawyers argue in that section that because Kia and Hyundai vehicles have &quot;not been the subject of significant theft&quot; before the Kia Boys social media trend, social media and the people who steal the cars -- and not the car companies -- are to blame for the thefts. This argument is summarized in the section titled &quot;Social Media Incited Unprecedented Rise In Thefts.&quot; The filing broadly reflects both the public communications strategy Kia and Hyundai have used throughout this crisis and some of the national news headlines that have covered the story,

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from the Associated Press: The Supreme Court agreed Friday to decide whether state laws that seek to regulate Facebook, TikTok, X and other social media platforms violate the Constitution. The justices will review laws enacted by Republican-dominated legislatures and signed by Republican governors in Florida and Texas. While the details vary, both laws aim to prevent the social media companies from censoring users based on their viewpoints. The court&#x27;s announcement, three days before the start of its new term, comes as the justices continue to grapple with how laws written at the dawn of the digital age, or earlier, apply to the online world.
 
The justices had already agreed to decide whether public officials can block critics from commenting on their social media accounts [...]. Separately, the high court also could consider a lower-court order limiting executive branch officials&#x27; communications with social media companies about controversial online posts. The new social media cases follow conflicting rulings by two appeals courts, one of which upheld the Texas law, while the other struck down Florida&#x27;s statute. By a 5-4 vote, the justices kept the Texas law on hold while litigation over it continues.

                              <span>Jude Karabus writes via The Register: Norway has told the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) it believes a countrywide ban on Meta harvesting user data to serve up advertising on Facebook and Instagram should be made permanent and extended across Europe. The Scandinavian country&#x27;s Data Protection Authority, Datatilsynet, had been holding back Facebook parent Meta from scooping up data on its citizens with the threat of fines of one million Kroner (about $94,000) per day if it didn&#x27;t comply.
 
In August, it said Meta hadn&#x27;t been playing ball and started serving up the daily fines. However, the ban that resulted in these fines, put into place in July, expires on November 3 â&quot; hence Norway&#x27;s request for a &quot;binding decision.&quot; The July order came after a Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruling [PDF] earlier that month stating Meta&#x27;s data processing operation was also hauling in protected data â&quot; race and ethnicity, religious affiliation, sexual orientation etc. â&quot; when it cast its behavioral ads net.
 
Norway is not a member of the EU but is part of the European single market, and the CJEU, as Europe&#x27;s top court, has the job of making sure the application and interpretation of law within the market is compliant with European treaties (this part would apply to Norway) as well as ensuring that legislation adopted by the EU is applied the same way across all Member States. Datatilsynet&#x27;s ruling said the central processing of that data by the American company was putting Meta in violation of the EU&#x27;s General Data Protection Regulation. A spokesperson for Meta said it was &quot;surprised&quot; by the Norwegian authority&#x27;s actions, &quot;given that Meta has already committed to moving to the legal basis of consent for advertising in the EU/EEA.&quot;
 
It added: &quot;We remain in active discussions with the relevant data protection authorities on this topic via our lead regulator in the EU, the Irish Data Protection Commission, and will have more to share in due course.&quot;

In &quot;late 2024,&quot; the whole project will shut down, and we don&#x27;t just mean the hardware will stop being for sale; the cloud-based apps will stop working, too.
 
Most people probably haven&#x27;t ever heard of Jamboard, but this was a giant 55-inch, 4K touchscreen on a rolling stand that launched in 2016. Like most Google touchscreens, this ran Android with a locked-down custom interface on top inst…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Next time you try to wipe a smudge off your iPhone screen, take a closer look. See if you can spot one of the two tiny QR codes etched into its glass. Chances are you won&#x27;t be able to find them. Both codes are tiny -- one is the size of a grain of sand and can only be seen with special equipment, while the other, roughly the size of the tip of a crayon, is laser-printed on the reverse side of the glass somewhere along its black border or bezel. The codes are placed on the glass at different stages of manufacturing to help Apple track and reduce defects. They represent the company&#x27;s obsessive attention to detail in manufacturing devices such as the iPhone, which has helped it squeeze costs in a traditionally low-margin business. 

&quot;Apple has been granularly and singularly tracking many components in the iPhone for some time, but expanding that to the glass and doing it with a microscopic bar code is another level of obsessive attention to detail that few companies would do,&quot; said Kyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit, a popular Apple gadget repair site. &quot;I&#x27;ve never heard of serial numbers on the glass level, but if you&#x27;re throwing infinite money at improving your manufacturing knowledge, then why not?&quot; Apple added the smaller of the two QR codes -- 0.2 mm in width -- to iPhone screens in 2020 so it can track precisely how many usable cover glass units its two Chinese suppliers, Lens Technology and Biel Crystal, are making and how many defective cover glass units they are throwing away during manufacturing. Lens and Biel have previously stymied Apple&#x27;s efforts to learn the true rate of defects, which can raise its production costs. Apple has paid millions of dollars to install laser and scanning equipment at Lens and Biel factories to both add the microscopic QR code and scan the cover glass at the end of the production process.

                              <span>Japan&#x27;s Transport Safety Board on Thursday judged that a cargo ship that spilled 1,000 tons of fuel oil into a pristine marine environment off the coast of Mauritius in 2020 was travelling off course in search of a cell phone signal. From a report: The MV Wakashio was en route from Lianyungang, China to a Brazilian port when, on July 25 2020, it struck trouble near Blue Bay Marine Park, a popular snorkeling spot on the Indian Ocean nation Mauritius. The Japanese-owned vessel was sailing under a Panamanian flag of convenience, and captained by a Indian national. According to the report, two days before it ran aground, the captain changed the 100,000-plus ton ship&#x27;s route to travel five nautical miles from the coast line instead of the originally planned 22 nautical miles. He ordered the course change without obtaining proper marine charts of the area and therefore did not know that waters in the area are less than 20 meters deep. 

The ship subsequently hit a coral reef. &quot;Reefs and obstacles were displayed near the place of occurrence,&quot; reads the 89-page Japan Transport Safety Board report in Japanese. &quot;The body buckled due to being knocked to the seabed and broke into the skin near the fuel oil tank. As a result, about 1,000 tons of fuel oil loaded in the tank spilled out to sea,&quot; the document states. The report noted that the captain of the vessel changed the voyage plan for the purpose of coming within range of signal for his smartphone. It also noted the behavior was not an isolated incident and that safety awareness among the crew at large was lacking.

                              <span>Two designers from New Zealand built a wildly popular social network for movie buffs. Now, they&#x27;re cashing in (and sticking around for the sequel). The New York Times: The &quot;Barbie&quot; star Margot Robbie created an account. Ditto Rian Johnson, the &quot;Knives Out&quot; auteur. Christopher McQuarrie, Tom Cruise&#x27;s directing partner, has used his to heap praise on another action star (Sylvester Stallone). Letterboxd, the social network for recommending and reviewing movies, has become a kind of shibboleth for film nerds over the past decade. Roughly 10 million people now use the service to share their favorites: You like Studio Ghibli, too? What&#x27;s your favorite Spike Lee joint? 

The service has not undergone any revolutionary changes since it was founded in 2011. But Letterboxd is undergoing two big changes: a new owner and, eventually, user recommendations and review of TV shows. Matthew Buchanan and Karl von Randow, Letterboxd&#x27;s founders, announced on Friday that they were selling a majority stake in the service to Tiny, a public company in Victoria, British Columbia. The deal values Letterboxd at more than $50 million, said a person familiar with the sale, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential financial information. 

Mr. Buchanan and Mr. von Randow, two entrepreneurs based in New Zealand, have reassurances for their users who may be afraid of what a sale could mean for their corner of the internet. First, neither co-founder is planning to leave any time soon, and both will remain shareholders. And the service itself isn&#x27;t changing immediately. The proposal to incorporate TV is still in its infancy, and the founders said they did not expect that the addition would disrupt their existing products.

The adapter&#x27;s app also kindly informed me that it&#x27;s sending all of my data to China. 

The cord was discovered by friend of 404 Media John Bumstead, an electronics refurbisher and artist who buys devices in bulk from electronics recyclers. Bumstead tweeted about the cord and was kind enough to send me one so I could try it myself. Joseph has written about malicious lightning cables and USB cables made by hackers that can be used for keystroke logging and spying. While those malicious lightning cables are products marketed for spying, the HDMI adapter Bumstead has been found in the wild and is just another crappy knockoff cable sold on Amazon&#x27;s increasingly difficult to navigate website. This HDMI adapter is designed to look exactly like Apple&#x27;s same adapter.

Then imagine getting coverage of your report in the Sun, Times, Daily Mail, Daily Express and Spectator. Sound impossible? Well, let me tell you how Civitas, one of the thinktanks housed at 55 Tufton Street in London, did exactly that, and nearly got away with it. On Wednesday, Civitas published a pamphlet on net zero by Ewen Stewart, whose consultancy, Walbrook Economics, works on &quot;the interaction of macroeconomics, politics and capital markets.&quot; Stewart is also a climate sceptic, having written in 2021 that human-caused warming is a &quot;contested theory.&quot; Along with Civitas, 55 Tufton Street also houses the climate-s…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: In December 2022, we published a short PSA, reminding users they could still activate Windows 11 and 10 with valid Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 keys. This practice dates back to 2015 when Microsoft launched Windows 10 with a one-year free upgrade window. Besides letting Windows 7/8 users upgrade for free to Windows 10, Microsoft allowed activating its newest OS using keys from the previous releases. 

Upgrade from Windows 7 and 8 to Windows is no longer possible, and it now seems that Microsoft is removing the loophole to prevent users from activating Windows 11 with old Windows license keys. As spotted by Deskmodder, Microsoft published a message on the Device Partner Center, notifying customers that the installation path to obtain free upgrades from Windows 7 and 8 to more recent Windows versions is no longer available. What it means is that you can no longer update from Windows 7/8/8.1 to Windows 10 or 11.

                              <span>Three Arrows Capital co-founder Su Zhu was apprehended in Singapore while trying to leave the country on Friday. From a report: Teneo, which is liquidating the defunct firm&#x27;s estate, said it received a committal order against Zhu after he failed to comply with an earlier Singapore court order compelling him to cooperate with the liquidation investigation. The order sentenced Zhu to four months in prison, according to a statement by Teneo. Zhu was apprehended at Singapore&#x27;s Changi Airport on Friday afternoon, Teneo said, adding that the Sept. 25 order also saw Zhu&#x27;s co-founder Kyle Davies receive the same sentence. Zhu didn&#x27;t immediately respond to a request for comment.

                              <span>Microsoft discussed selling its Bing search engine to Apple around 2020, a deal that would have replaced Google as the default option on the iPhone maker&#x27;s devices, Bloomberg News reported Friday, citing people with knowledge of the matter. From the report: Executives from Microsoft met with Apple&#x27;s services chief, Eddy Cue, who brokered the current search engine relationship with Alphabet&#x27;s Google, to discuss the possibility of acquiring Bing, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the situation was confidential. The talks were exploratory and never reached an advanced stage, they said. 

Over the years, the companies have discussed other ways to make Bing the preferred option, though Apple ultimately stuck with Google. Those talks have taken on fresh significance now that the US Department of Justice is in a legal fight with Google to show that the company abused its search dominance. Apple&#x27;s relationship with Google, which pays billions of dollars to give its search engine a prime spot in the iPhone and other devices, is central to the case.

                              <span>Chipmaker Intel said on Friday it had begun high-volume production using extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines at its $18.5 billion plant in Ireland, calling it a &quot;landmark&quot; moment as it seeks to regain ground on its rivals. From a report: The EUV tools, which are theoretically precise enough to hit a person&#x27;s thumb with a laser pointer from the moon, will play a key role in meeting Intel&#x27;s goal of delivering five generations of technology in four years, the U.S. company said. The effort in Ireland is Intel&#x27;s first attempt at high-volume manufacturing using EUV technology. Once the world&#x27;s leading chip manufacturer, Intel has lost the lead but says it is on track to regain it with manufacturing technology it says will rival the best from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. 

&quot;This is a landmark for Intel and the semiconductor industry as a whole,&quot; Ann Kelleher, Intel&#x27;s general manager of technology development, said in a statement. &quot;The transfer of Intel 4 process technology into high-volume production in Ireland is a giant step toward enabling leading-edge manufacturing in Europe.&quot; The plant, located in the town of Leixlip outside Dublin, is the first high-volume location for its manufacturing process called Intel 4 that uses EUV. The advanced manufacturing technique will produce its forthcoming &quot;Meteor Lake&quot; chip for laptops, which will pave the way for AI PCs.

                              <span>Starting on November 1st, Disney Plus will begin restricting password sharing in Canada. The Verge reports: Disney has not provided many details on how it plans to enforce this policy -- its email merely states that &quot;we&#x27;re implementing restrictions on your ability to share your account or login credentials outside of your household.&quot; The announcement reads more like a strong finger wag than anything else. &quot;You may not share your subscription outside of your household,&quot; reads the company&#x27;s updated Help Center.
 
A new &quot;account sharing&quot; section in the Canadian subscriber agreement also notes that the company may &quot;analyze the use of your account&quot; and that failing to comply with the agreement could lead to account limits or termination. After Netflix started cracking down on password sharing in the U.S., it resulted in the &quot;four single largest days of U.S. user sign-ups since January 2019,&quot; according to Variety. The streaming giant later went on to add 2.6 million U.S. subscribers in July.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from the Japan Times: From Oct. 1, a new tax regulation decades in the making will go into effect -- and hundreds of thousands of workers in Japan are angry. The Qualified Invoicing System, which requires taxable businesses to issue invoices containing tax information for transactions, has generated a full-fledged movement against it. A petition on Change.org to halt the regulation has received nearly 450,000 signatures. The social movement [...] has held regular demonstrations and conferences advocating against the law, alongside significant protest from the world of pop culture: Animators, filmmakers, voice actors, manga artists and V-tubers of all stripes have joined together against it.

                              <span>A few years ago, we needed some hardware fast. After some back and forth with the vendor, they promised “expedited delivery”. That sounded like a good thing, but it meant nothing.
To us, expedited delivery meant overnight delivery. That’s what we had in our head. Our experiences elsewhere equated expedited as overnight, but expedited isn’t overnight – it just means faster, prioritized, enhanced, sooner. 
But it doesn’t mean overnight. Expedited is relative, not absolute. If standard shipping takes 7 days, expedited could mean 5.
Of course, as you’ve probably guessed, the stuff we thought would come overnight didn’t come overnight. A harsh call the next day to the vendor ultimately got us the hardware overnight the next day, but we lost a day in the exchange.
What we had in front of us was …</span>

                              <span>According to Bloomberg&#x27;s Jason Schreier, Epic games is laying off 16 percent of its current workforce, which amounts to almost 900 employees losing their jobs. Kotaku reports: A memo was shared this morning at the North Carolina company, seen by Kotaku, informing staff of the bad news. It explains that alongside 16 percent of staff being laid off, the company is also selling Bandcamp, and &quot;spinning off&quot; most of marketing company SuperAwesome.
 
&quot;For a while now, we&#x27;ve been spending way more money than we earn,&quot; says the memo, sent to staff by CEO Tim Sweeney. &quot;I have long been optimistic we could power through this transition without layoffs, but in retrospect I see that this was unrealistic.&quot; It seems that Fortnite&#x27;s failure to continue growing was part of the problem. Sweeney reports that it&#x27;s &quot;starting to grow again,&quot; but this is driven by creator content &quot;with significant revenue sharing.&quot;
 
Despite efforts to reduce spending, Sweeney says &quot;we still ended up far short of financial sustainability.&quot; These layoffs, he hopes, will &quot;stabilize our finances.&quot; &quot;Laid-off Epic employees will receive six months severance and health benefits,&quot; Schreier said on X, adding that an &quot;all-hands meeting [is] happening shortly.&quot; Further reading: Apple Asks Supreme Court To Reverse App Store Ruling Won by Epic

                              <span>According to the Wall Street Journal, Nvidia&#x27;s French offices were raided this week on suspicion the chipmaker engaged in anticompetitive practices. Reuters reports: The French competition authority, which disclosed the dawn raid on Wednesday, did not say what practices it was investigating or which company it had targeted, beyond saying it was in the &quot;graphics cards sector.&quot; The French competition authority said that its operation this week followed a broader inquiry into the cloud-computing sector. The broader inquiry revolves around concerns that cloud-computing companies could use their access to computing power to exclude smaller competitors.
 
This week&#x27;s operation had targeted Nvidia, which is the world&#x27;s largest maker of chips used both for artificial intelligence and for computer graphics, the WSJ report added, citing people familiar with the raid. Chips originally made for computer graphics are suited for AI-related computing.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Canalys has some gruesome new numbers out for the North American smartphone market in Q2 2023, detailing what it&#x27;s calling the &quot;worst quarterly performance for over a decade.&quot; Q2 has plummeted 22 percent, year over year, and with these numbers, Canalys is predicting the smartphone market will be down 12 percent overall in 2023.
 
Apple is down 20 percent for Q2 and still in a dominant position with 54 percent market share. Samsung is down 27 percent, in second place overall with 24 percent market share in Q2 2023. Motorola is next with a 25 percent decline and only 8 percent market share. TCL, a TV company that feels like it only briefly dabbled in smartphones, is the single biggest loser, down 30 percent, with 5 percent market share.
 
Only a single company survived this quarter unscathed, and it&#x27;s actually Google! The company might be at the bottom of the smartphone charts, but Pixel phone sales are up 59 percent, earning Google 4 percent of the market. It was the same story last year, when Google jumped from 1 to 2 percent. In a few quarters, the company might hit fourth place. The biggest loss on the chart is actually &quot;others,&quot; down 43 percent, likely representing the further consolidation of the Android market. These are your OnePluses, your HMD/Nokias, and trashy pre-paid vendors like Blu.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: The Cloud Native Computing Foundation has returned to Shanghai for the city&#x27;s first Kubecon since the pandemic. During a keynote that switched languages several times, demonstrating the challenges faced by both AI and human translators in keeping up, Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation, threw out several crowd-pleasing statistics while also highlighting some projects likely to make one or two companies squirm a little. On the statistics front, Zemlin joked that the Linux Foundation was likely the largest software company in the world, noting that if one took an average software developer&#x27;s salary -- he put the worldwide mean as being $40,000 -- and multiplied it by the number of developers contributing to the foundation, the payroll would come to around $26 billion -- more than Microsoft&#x27;s $24 billion R&amp;D payroll. 

The statistic was somewhat tongue in cheek as Zemlin pointed out that none of the developers working on Linux Foundation projects actually work for the Linux Foundation. However, the sheer quantity of engineers involved highlighted another issue noted by Zemlin: the &quot;paradox of choice&quot; when selecting the correct open source project for a given purpose when the number on offer reaches the hundreds, thousands, and beyond. Reflecting the increasing maturity of some elements of the open source world, he also emphasized the opportunities for companies to increase revenues and profits through the use of open source. WeChat, Alibaba, and Huawei all received nods -- unsurprising considering the location -- as Zemlin noted a virtuous circle whereby improvements go back into projects, meaning better profits, meaning more improvements, and so on. It all sounded very utopian, although darkening clouds were signaled by the addition of OpenTofu to the list of projects Zemlin was keen to boast about, including open source efforts around large language models.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a story: Almost two years ago, Mark Zuckerberg rebranded his company Facebook to Meta -- and since then, he has been focused on building the &quot;metaverse,&quot; a three-dimensional virtual reality. But the metaverse has lost some of its luster since 2021. Companies like Disney have closed down their metaverse divisions and deemphasized using the word, while crypto-based startup metaverses have quietly languished or imploded. In 2022, Meta&#x27;s Reality Labs division reported an operational loss of $13.7 billion. But at Meta Connect 2023, Zuckerberg still hasn&#x27;t given up on the metaverse -- he&#x27;s just shifted how he talks about it. He once focused on the metaverse as a completely digital new world. Now, he aims to convince the public that the future is a blend of the digital and the physical. 

At Connect this year, Zuckerberg emphasized that the modern &quot;real world&quot; combines the physical world and the digital world still being built -- and that it all builds up to &quot;this concept we call the metaverse.&quot; He added: &quot;Pretty soon, I think we&#x27;re going to be at a point where you&#x27;re going to be there physically with some of your friends, and others will be there digitally as avatars or holograms, and they&#x27;ll feel just as present as everyone else. Or you&#x27;ll walk into a meeting and sit down at a table. There will be people who are there physically and people who are there digitally as holograms, but also sitting around the table with you are going to be a bunch of AI guys who are embodied as holograms and are helping you get different stuff done too.&quot;

                              <span>Swiss glaciers have lost 10% of their volume in just two years, a report has found. From a report: Scientists have said climate breakdown caused by the burning of fossil fuels is the cause of unusually hot summers and winters with very low snow volume, which have caused the accelerating melts. The volume lost during the hot summers of 2022 and 2023 is the same as that lost between 1960 and 1990. The analysis by the Swiss Academy of Sciences found 4% of Switzerland&#x27;s total glacier volume vanished this year, the second-biggest annual decline on record. The largest decline was in 2022, when there was a 6% drop, the biggest thaw since measurements began. Experts have stopped measuring the ice on some glaciers as there is essentially none left. Glacier Monitoring in Switzerland (Glamos), which monitors 176 glaciers, recently halted measurements at the St Annafirn glacier in the central Swiss canton of Uri since it had mostly melted.

                              <span>Astronomers have captured the first direct evidence of a black hole spinning, providing new insights into the universe&#x27;s most enigmatic objects. From a report: The observations focus on the supermassive black hole at the centre of the neighbouring Messier 87 galaxy, whose shadow was imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope. Like many supermassive black holes, M87 features powerful jets that are launched from the poles at close to the speed of light into intergalactic space. Scientists have predicted that the rotation of a black hole powers these cosmic jets, but until now direct evidence was elusive. 

&quot;After the success of black hole imaging in this galaxy with the Event Horizon Telescope, whether this black hole is spinning or not has been a central concern among scientists,&quot; said Dr Kazuhiro Hada, of the national astronomical observatory of Japan and co-author. &quot;Now anticipation has turned into certainty. This monster black hole is indeed spinning.&quot; M87 is located 55m light years from the Earth and harbours a black hole 6.5bn times more massive than the Sun. Just beyond the black hole is an accretion disk of gas and dust, swirling on the precipice of the cosmic sinkhole. Some of this material is destined to fall into the black hole, disappearing for ever. But a fraction will be ejected out from the poles of the black hole at more than 99.99% of the speed of light. The paper: Precessing jet nozzle connecting to a spinning black hole in M87 (Nature).

The incident highlights the fact that delivery robots that are being deployed to sidewalks all around the country are essentially always filming, and that their footage can and has been used as evidence in criminal trials. Emails obtained by 404 Media also show that the robot food delivery company wanted to work more closely with the LAPD, which jumped at the opportunity.

                              <span>In an arXiv research paper titled &quot;Language Modeling Is Compression,&quot; researchers detail their discovery that the DeepMind large language model (LLM) called Chinchilla 70B can perform lossless compression on image patches from the ImageNet image database to 43.4 percent of their original size, beating the PNG algorithm, which compressed the same data to 58.5 percent. For audio, Chinchilla compressed samples from the LibriSpeech audio data set to just 16.4 percent of their raw size, outdoing FLAC compression at 30.3 percent. From a report: In this case, lower numbers in the results mean more compression is taking place. And lossless compression means that no data is lost during the compression process. It stands in contrast to a lossy compression technique like JPEG, which sheds some data and reconstructs some of the data with approximations during the decoding process to significantly reduce file sizes. The study&#x27;s results suggest that even though Chinchilla 70B was mainly trained to deal with text, it&#x27;s surprisingly effective at compressing other types of data as well, often better than algorithms specifically designed for those tasks. This opens the door for thinking about machine learning models as not just tools for text prediction and writing but also as effective ways to shrink the size of various types of data.

                              <span>Microsoft weighed investing multiple billions in a deal with Apple in 2016 to make its Bing search engine the default on the Safari browser and better compete with Alphabet&#x27;s dominant Google search, a Microsoft vice president testified Thursday in court. From the report: Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella met with Apple CEO Tim Cook as part of the talks, said Jon Tinter, a Microsoft business development vice president who is on the stand during the US Justice Department&#x27;s antitrust trial in Washington against Alphabet. Microsoft would have taken a multi-billion dollar loss on the terms of the deal, Tinter said, but it would have bolstered Bing, eventually gaining more share and revenue. Microsoft had secured a deal for Apple to use Bing in Siri and Spotlight, an Apple feature to help find apps on iPhones from 2013 to 2017, but wanted to expand to Safari. Instead, Google wound up expanding its own deal with Apple to the products that had used Bing.

                              <span>OpenAI is in advanced talks with former Apple designer Sir Jony Ive and SoftBank&#x27;s Masayoshi Son to launch a venture to build the &quot;iPhone of artificial intelligence,&quot; FT reported Thursday, fuelled by more than $1bn in funding from the Japanese conglomerate. From the report: Sam Altman, OpenAI&#x27;s chief, has tapped Ive&#x27;s company LoveFrom, which the designer founded when he left Apple in 2019, to develop the ChatGPT creator&#x27;s first consumer device, according to three people familiar with the plan. Altman and Ive have held brainstorming sessions at the designer&#x27;s San Francisco studio about what a new consumer product centred on OpenAI&#x27;s technology would look like, the people said. 

They hope to create a more natural and intuitive user experience for interacting with AI, in the way that the iPhone&#x27;s innovations in touchscreen computing unleashed the mass-market potential of the mobile internet. The process of identifying a design or device remains at an early stage with many different ideas on the table, they said. Son, SoftBank&#x27;s founder and chief executive, has also been involved in some of the discussions, pitching a central role for Arm -- the chip designer in which the Japanese conglomerate holds a 90 per cent stake -- as well as offering financial backing.

                              <span>Apple said it has asked the US Supreme Court to review a judge&#x27;s ruling from two years ago that could diminish the billions of dollars in revenue its App Store generates by letting app developers direct users to alternative payment methods. From a report: Apple&#x27;s request to the high court on Thursday is its latest salvo in a drawn-out battle with Epic Games over how the iPhone maker runs its app marketplace. App Store revenue is lucrative for Apple, with developers charged a commission of as much as 30% for sales of digital goods and services -- a fee that the maker of the popular Fortnite game is trying to avoid paying. At the same time, years of complaints from app developers and scrutiny from governments globally have already forced Apple to rewrite some of the rules protecting its dominance in the $160 billion app distribution marketplace. 

Apple&#x27;s request comes a day after Epic petitioned the Supreme Court to review a separate part of the ruling, that App Store policies don&#x27;t violate federal antitrust laws. Apple&#x27;s filing couldn&#x27;t immediately be confirmed in court records. The Supreme Court, per its regular schedule, could decide by the end of the year or early next year whether it will take up either or both of the petitions. In a mixed ruling in September 2021 following a trial, a federal judge in Oakland, California, largely rejected Epic&#x27;s claims that Apple&#x27;s online marketplace policies violated federal law by barring third-party app marketplaces on its operating system. But she also found that Apple flouted California state law by blocking developers from letting consumers know about alternative payment methods. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the trial judge&#x27;s decision in April.

                              <span>The new iPhone 15 Pro may be too hot for some to handle. Literally. WSJ: Apple&#x27;s priciest new iPhones are heating up in some scenarios, reaching high temperatures that make them difficult to touch at certain times, according to reviews, tests by The Wall Street Journal and social-media posts from buyers in China, the U.S. and Canada. Some iPhone 14 Pro owners have noticed similar hot temperatures over the past year. The high temperatures in Apple&#x27;s newest 15 Pro models -- typically when charging and using intensive apps -- are prompting concerns that the company might need to address overheating in software updates that could impact performance. Premium iPhones have long been a critical cash cow for Apple as smartphone demand has slumped globally. 

The company is hoping the iPhone 15, especially its Pro models, will return its business to growth. Thomas Galvin, a 23-year-old from Cleveland, says his iPhone 15 Pro Max has been &quot;super hot&quot; and that he is considering returning it. Apple customer support told him the heat was a result of setting up the new phone, but even a few days later, it is still &quot;way worse than the iPhone 13 Pro Max,&quot; he said. Other users on X (formerly known as Twitter) and Reddit have had similar complaints about the heat, with some mentioning that the phone had become so warm it is difficult to hold. The Wall Street Journal&#x27;s Joanna Stern noted in her review last week that the iPhone 15 Pro Max hit 106 degrees Fahrenheit while charging. In further testing, the phone reached temperatures up to 112 degrees when simultaneously charging and doing processor-intensive tasks, such as gaming.

                              <span>OpenAI says ChatGPT is &quot;no longer limited to data before September 2021.&quot; It can now browse the internet to provide you with up-to-date information, &quot;complete with direct links to sources.&quot; From the announcement: Since the original launch of browsing in May, we received useful feedback. Updates include following robots.txt and identifying user agents so sites can control how ChatGPT interacts with them. Browsing is particularly useful for tasks that require up-to-date information, such as helping you with technical research, trying to choose a bike, or planning a vacation.
 
Browsing is available to Plus and Enterprise users today, and we&#x27;ll expand to all users soon. To enable, choose Browse with Bing in the selector under GPT-4.

The hacking group, tracked under names including BlackTech, Palmerworm, Temp.Overboard, Circuit Panda, and Radio Panda, has been operating since at least 2010, a joint advisory published by government entities in the US and Japan reported. The group has a history of targeting public organizations and private companies in the US and East Asia.

                              <span>Alex Wilhelm writes via TechCrunch: Layoffs in the technology industry have slowed sharply in recent months, bringing the number of jobs lost to tech&#x27;s efficiency push to a near stop. According to several services that track layoffs in the tech industry, after reaching a local maximum in January, the number of people laid off had declined by more than 90% by September. What&#x27;s more, some tech companies are hiring again to refill some of the roles that they had eliminated mere months ago.
 
Such a quick shift from mass personnel cuts to more stable employee rolls and even hiring efforts may seem surprising, but it&#x27;s been a long time in the making. Data from popular tech industry layoff tracker Layoffs.fyi shows that job cuts have slowed for seven consecutive months this year, plateauing around 10,000 per month from June through August and declining to just over 3,000 so far in September. TrueUp, a jobs board focused on the tech industry, also marked that tech industry layoffs peaked in January and declined sharply thereafter. However, TrueUp&#x27;s layoff count shows a slightly lumpier trend in the total number of staff cuts. Regardless of the source, though, the trend is clear that job cuts are on the decline.

                              <span>Indonesia said it will bar social media companies from allowing transactions and doubling as e-commerce platforms -- all to prevent misuse of public data. &quot;This means that users in Indonesia cannot buy or sell products and services on TikTok and Facebook,&quot; reports CNBC. From the report: In a media conference Monday, Minister of Trade Zulkifli Hasan said that &quot;the connection [between social media and e-commerce] must be separated so that the algorithm is not all controlled&quot; and this &quot;prevents the use of personal data&quot; for business purposes. Indonesia also said it would also regulate which overseas goods can be sold, adding these products would receive the same treatment as offline domestic goods. The move comes as foreign goods become increasingly available in Indonesia through social media platforms. &quot;Social commerce was born to solve a real world problem for local traditional small sellers, by matching them with local creators who can help drive traffic to their online shops,&quot; a TikTok spokesperson said in response to the move.
 
&quot;While we respect local laws and regulations, we hope that the regulations take into account its impact on the livelihoods of more than 6 million sellers and close to 7 million affiliate creators who use TikTok Shop.&quot;

                              <span>Volkswagen says it was hit by a major IT outage on Wednesday, halting production at the company&#x27;s namesake brand in Germany. Reuters reports: Volkswagen said that the whole group, which includes the Porsche AG and Audi brands, was affected. Volkswagen said there had been an unspecified &quot;IT malfunction of network components&quot; at the carmaker&#x27;s site in Wolfsburg, its global headquarters.
 
&quot;The fault has been present since 12:30 p.m. (CET) and is currently being analysed. There are implications for vehicle-producing plants,&quot; the group said. &quot;According to current analyses, an external attack is unlikely to be the cause of the system malfunction,&quot; Volkswagen said, adding that efforts to fix the problem were of the highest priority and well under way.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Motherboard: Every week, the social media hype-train seems to find new ways to sensationalize generative AI tools. Most recently, a new technique that allows users to produce optical illusions went viral, with some describing the results as AI-generated images with &quot;subliminal&quot; messages. The technique, called ControlNet, essentially lets users have more control over the generated image by specifying additional inputs -- in this case, letting you create images or words within other images. Some users characterized this as a form of &quot;hidden message&quot; that could be used to implant suggestions in the form of subtle visual cues, like a McDonald&#x27;s &quot;M&quot; logo appearing in the outlines of a movie poster.
 
ControlNet uses the AI image-generating tool Stable Diffusion, and one of its initial uses was generating fancy QR codes using the code as an input image. That idea was then taken further, with some users developing a workflow that lets them specify any image or text as a black-and-white mask that implants itself into the generated image -- kind of like an automated, generative version of the masking tool in Photoshop.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Intel&#x27;s Meteor Lake processor architecture promises to be its most interesting in recent history, but we&#x27;ve known for a while now that Intel isn&#x27;t planning to launch a version for socketed desktop motherboards like the ones you&#x27;d find in a self-built PC or an off-the-shelf mini tower. For those systems, Intel plans to release a second consecutive refresh of the old Alder Lake architecture, the one that first came to desktops in 12th-generation Core CPUs in 2021. In an interview with PCWorld, Intel Client Computing Group General Manager Michelle Johnston Holthaus said that Meteor Lake chips would be coming to desktops after all. But the company backpedaled a bit a couple of days later, clarifying that these Meteor Lake desktop chips would be of the soldered-to-the-motherboard variety, not intended as high-performance replacements for current desktop Core i7 and Core i9 chips. 

This kind of bifurcation isn&#x27;t totally unheard of, especially when Intel is in the process of shifting to a new manufacturing technology, as it is with Meteor Lake. Chips for high-performance desktops tend to be physically larger and also need to be able to scale up to higher clock speeds, two things that are harder to do when a manufacturing process is new. And Meteor Lake is nothing if not complex to manufacture, using new Intel Foveros packaging technology to combine four different silicon dies produced on three different manufacturing processes by two different companies. Some of Intel&#x27;s 10th-generation Core CPUs for laptops and all of the 11th-gen laptop CPUs had moved to new architectures and Intel&#x27;s 10 nm manufacturing process, while the desktop chips remained stuck on the more mature (but aging) 14 nm process.

                              <span>The U.S. government on Wednesday sued eBay, accusing the online platform of violating the Clean Air Act and other environmental laws by allowing the sale of several harmful products, including devices that defeat automobile pollution controls. From a report: EBay could face billions of dollars in penalties, including up to $5,580 for each Clean Air Act violation, according to the government&#x27;s complaint filed in the federal court in Brooklyn, New York. The Department of Justice said eBay illegally allowed the sale of at least 343,011 aftermarket &quot;defeat&quot; devices that help vehicles generate more power and get better fuel economy by evading emissions controls. 

EBay was also accused of allowing the sale of at least 23,000 unregistered, misbranded or restricted-use pesticides, violating a 2020 &quot;stop sale&quot; order from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The San Jose, California-based company also allegedly distributed 5,614 paint and coating removal products containing methylene chloride, a potentially lethal chemical linked to brain and liver cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. &quot;EBay has the power, the authority, and the resources to stop the sale of these illegal, harmful products on its website,&quot; the complaint said. &quot;It has chosen not to; instead, it has chosen to engage in these illegal transactions.&quot;

                              <span>The next-generation of Meta Quest hardware is here, and Meta announced a bunch of software news alongside the Quest 3 VR headset hardware reveal at its Connect conference. One such announcement was the debut of Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Cloud Gaming service on Meta Quest 3, which is actually a huge boon for fans of the Facebook owner&#x27;s mixed reality gear. From a report: The Xbox Cloud Gaming implementation in Quest resembles a lot of how Apple showed its own vision for mixed reality with the Vision Pro headset: It&#x27;s primarily a virtual screen that can float in either a virtual or mixed reality space, which appears to be reposition-able and resizable, but which basically works exactly as you&#x27;d expect an Xbox game to work with a large TV. This is a key acknowledgement on the part of Meta that while immersive, native gaming is undoubtedly a draw for users, so too is a more traditional gaming experience that basically just benefits from taking place in your own private face-mounted theater.

                              <span>Many readers shared this report: Antimatter just lost a little more pizazz. Physicists know that for every fundamental particle in nature there is an antiparticle -- an evil twin of identical mass but endowed with equal and opposite characteristics like charge and spin. When these twins meet, they obliterate each other, releasing a flash of energy on contact. In science fiction, antiparticles provide the power for warp drives. Some physicists have speculated that antiparticles are being repelled by gravity or even traveling backward in time. 

A new experiment at CERN, the European Center for Nuclear Research, brings some of that speculation back down to Earth. In a gravitational field, it turns out, antiparticles fall just like the rest of us. &quot;The bottom line is that there&#x27;s no free lunch, and we&#x27;re not going to be able to levitate using antimatter,&quot; said Joel Fajans of the University of California, Berkeley. Dr. Fajans was part of an international team known as ALPHA, the Antihydrogen Laser Physics Apparatus collaboration, which is based at CERN and led by Jeffrey Hangst, a particle physicist at Aarhus University in Denmark. 

Dr. Fajans and his colleagues assembled about 100 hundred anti-atoms of hydrogen and suspended them in a magnetic field. When the field was slowly ramped down, the anti-hydrogen atoms drifted down like maple leaves in October and at the same rate of downward acceleration, or g force, as regular atoms: about 32 feet per second per second. They published their result on Wednesday in the journal Nature. Few physicists were surprised by the result. According to Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity, all forms of matter and energy respond equally to gravity.

                              <span>Meta introduced its latest lineup of head-worn devices, staking fresh claim to the virtual- and augmented-reality industry just ahead of Apple pushing into the market. From a report: The company officially unveiled the Quest 3 headset on Wednesday, raising the price by $200 to $500, at its annual Connect developers conference. It also introduced second-generation smart glasses that it developed with luxury sunglass maker Ray-Ban. The Quest 3, which was previewed by Meta earlier this year after Bloomberg published a hands-on review of the device, offers improved performance over the Quest 2 from 2020. It also marks a pivot from VR to mixed reality, which melds virtual and augmented reality. 

It&#x27;s a high-stakes moment for Meta&#x27;s hardware business. Though the company has dominated VR goggles for years, Apple is poised to release its Vision Pro headset in the coming months, setting up a showdown. Like the Quest 3, the Vision Pro is a mixed-reality headset -- though one with exclusive Apple technology and content. The Vision Pro will have Apple&#x27;s marketing muscle behind it, but also a much higher price: $3,499. In addition to the competitive pressure, Meta also has struggled to sell consumers on the metaverse -- a collection of interlocking online worlds that make use of its headsets.

                              <span>A Microsoft executive said the company has tried for years to displace Alphabet&#x27;s Google as the default web browser on iPhones, but that Apple never seriously considered switching to Microsoft&#x27;s Bing and was content to use it as a &quot;bargaining chip&quot; with the search giant. From a report: &quot;Apple is making more money on Bing existing than Bing does,&quot; Mikhail Parakhin, the head of Microsoft&#x27;s advertising and web services, testified during the US government&#x27;s antitrust trial against Google in Washington. &quot;We are always trying to convince Apple to use our search engine.&quot; Parakhin, who joined Microsoft in 2019 from Russian search engine Yandex NV, said Microsoft met with Apple as recently as 2021 to discuss a potential switch to Bing, but didn&#x27;t make any progress. 

In response to Google&#x27;s lawyers, Parakhin said it was &quot;uneconomical for Microsoft to invest more&quot; in technology for the mobile search market. &quot;Unless Microsoft gets a more significant, or firmer guarantee of distribution, it makes it uneconomical to invest.&quot; Apple has used Google as the default search engine in its Safari browser since 2003 in exchange for a share of the advertising revenue earned through searches made on its devices.

                              <span>EA has suddenly removed downloadable versions of FIFA 23 from multiple digital storefronts. The delisting comes earlier than expected for the title and coincides with the company&#x27;s launch of the newly FIFA-license-free EA Sports FC 24. From a report: While many reports suggest there has been a recent mass purge of all legacy FIFA games from online stores, EA has a history of delisting older sports titles at a pretty regular cadence. FIFA 22, for instance, was delisted from digital storefronts in May, roughly seven months after the launch of the subsequent FIFA 23. And FIFA 21 wasn&#x27;t taken down from Steam until June 2022, about eight months after FIFA 22&#x27;s launch. 

FIFA 23, on the other hand, has been delisted less than a year from its October 2022 launch. SteamDB tracking data suggests that the delisting came on September 21, the day before the new EA Sports FC became available for a 10-hour early access trial for EA Play members. The Steam store page for FIFA 23 now notes that the delisting comes &quot;at the request of the publisher&quot; and that the game &quot;will not appear in search.&quot; The game also no longer appears on Steam&#x27;s EA publisher page. FIFA 23&#x27;s earlier-than-expected delisting could have something to do with the dissolution of EA&#x27;s 30-year licensing relationship with FIFA. That ending came amid reports that EA was dissatisfied with gameplay restrictions and licensing costs demanded by FIFA.

                              <span>A company that acquires and sells zero-day exploits -- flaws in software that are unknown to the affected developer -- is now offering to pay researchers $20 million for hacking tools that would allow its customers to hack iPhones and Android devices. From a report: On Wednesday, Operation Zero announced on its Telegram accounts and on its official account on X, formerly Twitter, that it was increasing payments for zero-days in those platforms tenfold, from $200,000 to $20 million. &quot;By increasing the premium and providing competitive plans and bonuses for contract works, we encourage the developer teams to work with our platform,&quot; the company wrote. 

Operation Zero, which is based in Russia and launched in 2021, also added that &quot;as always, the end user is a non-NATO country.&quot; On its official website, the company says that &quot;our clients are Russian private and government organizations only.&quot; When asked why they only sell to non-NATO countries, Operation Zero CEO Sergey Zelenyuk declined to say. &quot;No reasons other than obvious ones,&quot; he said. Zelenyuk also said that the bounties Operation Zero offer right now may be temporary, and a reflection of a particular time in the market, and the difficulty of hacking iOS and Android.

                              <span>The US Federal Trade Commission is reviving its challenge against Microsoft&#x27;s $69 billion acquisition of video game company Activision, a move which may seek to unwind the deal after it closes. From a report: The agency will move forward with its in-house trial against the acquisition after pausing it over the summer, according to an order the agency issued Wednesday. The move means the FTC will continue challenging the deal even after it has closed this year. &quot;The commission has determined that the public interest warrants that this matter be resolved fully and expeditiously,&quot; the agency wrote in a filing. &quot;Therefore, the commission is returning this matter to adjudication.&quot; The decision comes months after a US appeals court denied the FTC&#x27;s bid to pause the Microsoft-Activision acquisition in July. The FTC typically drops challenges to deals when they lose in federal court.

Joby Aviation, an air taxi start-up, delivered the aircraft to Edwards Air Force Base in Southern California, where the first supersonic flight took place. Air taxis are typically powered by batteries and designed to lift off and land like helicopters, but include wings to fly like airplanes. Joby, which is based in Santa Cruz, Calif., said that its electric aircraft is substantially quieter than helicopters or planes. Each can carry one pilot and four passengers and travel as fast as 200 miles…</span>

                              <span>&quot;As a result of the move to working from home, Meta has walked away from one of its offices in London at the cost of 149 million pounds,&quot; writes Slashdot reader Bruce66423. The London Evening Standard reports: Meta paid the FTSE 250 developer 149 million pounds on Monday in order to break the lease on the building, 1 Triton Square. The tech firm, which also owns Instagram, let the space from 2021 following a refurbishment but never moved into the space. Meta has three open London sites including a neighbouring building in Regent&#x27;s Place, near Warren Street in central London.
 
Analysts at BNP Paribas Exane claimed Meta has another 18 years on its lease at the site. British Land said it will receive the one-off payment to end the lease but the agreement would also reduce its earnings per share by 0.6% over the six months to next March.

                              <span>Google Podcasts is shutting down in 2024 after YouTube Music picks up full global availability of podcasts, which is expected before the end of 2023. As 9to5Google reports, YouTube Music &quot;will be Google&#x27;s one podcasting app and service going forward.&quot; From the report: The big advantage of Google Podcasts was its simplicity and wide availability on Android (through the Google Search app). A &quot;simple migration tool&quot; will move your existing subscriptions from Google Podcasts. Notably, there will be the ability in YouTube Music to add podcasts via RSS feeds, &quot;including shows not currently hosted by YouTube.&quot; Google will also provide a non-YTM export option via &quot;OPML file of their show subscriptions&quot; that will work with other podcast players.
 
On the podcaster front, YouTube will allow for RSS uploads instead of requiring a video version. The next step over the coming weeks and months will see Google &quot;gather feedback to make the migration process from Google Podcasts to YouTube Music as simple and easy as possible.&quot; &quot;For now, nothing is changing and fans will continue to have access to YouTube, YouTube Music and Google Podcasts,&quot; says YouTube. &quot;We&#x27;re committed to being transparent in communicating future changes with our users and podcasters and will have more to share about this process in the coming months.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader writes: Chase UK, JPMorgan&#x27;s UK Bank, has told its customers that it will not carry out transactions related to crypto assets.
 The Financial Times writes: JPMorgan&#x27;s UK bank will stop customers buying cryptocurrencies from next month to combat rising numbers of criminals using digital assets to target victims.
 The ban by Chase UK, which notified customers by email on Tuesday, marks a step up as British lenders try to stop their networks being used for scams and frauds.
 While several banks, including HSBC and NatWest, have set restrictions on their customers&#x27; purchases for crypto, outright bans are rare.
 Chase said its UK block, which will come into effect from October 16, had been informed by data showing the high rate of crypto scams and fraud in the UK, including fake investments and false celebrity endorsements.

                              <span>Walmart is expanding its offerings of prepaid phone plans with MobileX, a wireless service launched earlier this year by Boost cofounder Peter Adderton. Walmart will be MobileX&#x27;s first and exclusive retail partner, the companies said in an announcement Tuesday. From a report: MobileX, which uses Verizon&#x27;s network through a wholesale agreement, will be available on Walmart&#x27;s website and in stores starting Tuesday, the companies said. It will offer unlimited pay-as-you go plans starting at $14.88 per month, and a lower-cost plan with customizable offerings starting at $4.08 a month. An artificial intelligence-powered guide that can anticipate a customer&#x27;s data needs can customize plans tailored to their usage, the company said in a statement. [...] Walmart gives MobileX, which launched online in February, more visibility as a low-cost alternative to more expensive monthly plans from the big three wireless carriers. Still, cheap mobile services have had a difficult time dislodging people from more expensive plans. Many subscribers are locked into two and three-year phone payment plans and even those that could switch say the hassle is not worth the savings.

                              <span>Microsoft is releasing one of its biggest updates to Windows 11 today. It includes access to the new Windows Copilot, AI-powered updates to Paint, Snipping Tool, and Photos, RGB lighting support, a modernized File Explorer, and much more. From a report: Windows Copilot is the big new feature for this Windows 11 update, bringing the same Bing Chat feature straight to the Windows 11 desktop. It appears as a sidebar in Windows 11, allowing you to control settings on a PC, launch apps, or simply answer queries. Microsoft is integrating Copilot into many parts of Windows, too. Copilot will essentially exist as an AI-powered digital assistant, much like Microsoft&#x27;s vision for Cortana. While Microsoft shut down the Cortana app inside Windows 11 last month, Copilot looks like it&#x27;s very much Microsoft&#x27;s big push into AI. 

Microsoft is also adding AI-powered features to Paint, Snipping Tool, and Windows 11&#x27;s Photos app. Microsoft Paint is getting Photoshop-like features, with support for transparency and layers. [...] File Explorer is getting a more modern look with this Windows 11 update. The updated File Explorer UI includes a modern home interface with large file thumbnails and a carousel interface that can surface recent files and favorited ones. These changes make File Explorer blend in better with the overall Windows 11 design.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s push to put artificial intelligence into its software has hinged almost entirely on OpenAI, the startup Microsoft funded in exchange for the right to use its cutting-edge technology. But as the costs of running advanced AI models rise, Microsoft researchers and product teams are working on a plan B. The Information: In recent weeks, Peter Lee, who oversees Microsoft&#x27;s 1,500 researchers, directed many of them to develop conversational AI that may not perform as well as OpenAI&#x27;s but that is smaller in size and costs far less to operate, according to a current employee and another person who recently left the company. Microsoft&#x27;s product teams are already working on incorporating some of that Microsoft-made AI software, powered by large language models, in existing products, such as a chatbot within Bing search that is similar to OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT, these people said. 

[...] Microsoft&#x27;s research group doesn&#x27;t have illusions about developing a large AI like GPT-4. The team doesn&#x27;t have the same computing resources as OpenAI, nor does it have armies of human reviewers to give feedback about how well their LLMs answer questions so engineers can improve them. Undeniably, OpenAI and other developers -- including Google and Anthropic, which on Monday received $4 billion from Amazon Web Services -- are firmly ahead of Microsoft when it comes to developing advanced LLMs. But Microsoft may be able to compete in a race to build AI models that mimic the quality of OpenAI software at a fraction of the cost, as Microsoft showed in June with the release of one in-house model it calls Orca.

From the report: The startup, which is 49% owned by Microsoft, has told investors that it expects to reach $1 billion in revenue this year and generate many billions more in 2024. OpenAI generates revenue mainly by charging individuals for access to a powerful version of ChatGPT and licensing the large language models behind that AI bot to businesses.

                              <span>Private equity firms have been increasingly adding another layer of debt to their complex borrowing arrangements, raising concern among some investors about potential risks to the wider industry and the financial system. Bloomberg: Hit by a drought of deals and dwindling cash, some buyout firms are starting to resort to backroom financing to help meet fund commitments or enable succession planning. The loans -- backed by assets including the promise of future income -- carry interest of as much as 19%, a rate that&#x27;s more akin to the charges faced by consumers rather than corporate borrowing. Even a junk-rated company in the US paid 10% on a bond recently. 

Those high costs aren&#x27;t deterring private equity firms and experts say demand is at an all-time high. While some of the biggest lenders -- such as Carlyle Group -- say these debts are relatively safe, others are already starting to take precautions by adding covenants that enable seizure of other underlying fund assets, highlighting worries about possible losses. Some are warning of perils when a firm faces claims from more than one type of loan simultaneously. &quot;If the value of the fund drops, for example, you&#x27;re looking at a margin call situation,&quot; said Jason Meklinsky, chief revenue and strategy officer at Socium Fund Services, a New Jersey-based firm that helps administer PE portfolios. &quot;It would be like a volcano meets a tornado.&quot; For an industry long used to easy money, the rush for such loans marks a reversal in fortune. Buyout firms have been battling rising interest rates and economic uncertainty, forcing takeover volumes to almost halve this year. Cash on hand at PEs is near the lowest since at least 2008, according to data from PitchBook.

The screens in the Washington, DC, courtroom had briefly malfunctioned and left witnesses with only binders, but now the tech was up and running -- showing an image of three iPhones, each demonstrating a part of the phone&#x27;s setup process. Cue squinted down at the screen. &quot;The resolution on this is terrible,&quot; he said. &quot;You should get a Mac.&quot; That got some laughs in an otherwise staid and quiet courtroom. Judge Amit Mehta, presiding over the case, leaned into his microphone and responded, &quot;If Apple would like to make a donation...&quot; That got even bigger laughs. Then everybody got back down to business. 

Cue was on the stand as a witness in US v. Google, the landmark antitrust trial over…</span>

                              <span>New submitter AsylumWraith shares a report: The US government aims to restore sweeping regulations for high-speed internet providers, such as AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon, reviving &quot;net neutrality&quot; rules for the broadband industry -- and an ongoing debate about the internet&#x27;s future. The proposed rules from the Federal Communications Commission will designate internet service -- both the wired kind found in homes and businesses as well as mobile data on cellphones -- as &quot;essential telecommunications&quot; akin to traditional telephone services, according to multiple people familiar with the plan. The rules would ban internet service providers (ISPs) from blocking or slowing down access to websites and online content, the people told CNN. 

Agency chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel plans to unveil the proposal in a speech at the National Press Club on Tuesday, the people added, saying the FCC plans to vote Oct. 19 on whether to advance the draft rules by soliciting public feedback on them -- a step that would precede the creation of any final rules. In addition to the prohibitions on blocking and throttling internet traffic, the draft rules also seek to prevent ISPs from selectively speeding up service to favored websites or to those that agree to pay extra fees, the people added, a move designed to prevent the emergence of &quot;fast lanes&quot; on the web that could give some websites a paid advantage over others.

                              <span>US intelligence agencies are getting their own ChatGPT-style tool to sift through an avalanche of public information for clues. From a report: The Central Intelligence Agency is preparing to roll out a feature akin to OpenAI&#x27;s now-famous program that will use artificial intelligence to give analysts better access to open-source intelligence, according to agency officials. The CIA&#x27;s Open-Source Enterprise division plans to provide intelligence agencies with its AI tool soon. &quot;We&#x27;ve gone from newspapers and radio, to newspapers and television, to newspapers and cable television, to basic internet, to big data, and it just keeps going,&quot; Randy Nixon, director of the division, said in an interview. &quot;We have to find the needles in the needle field.&quot; 

It&#x27;s part of a broader government campaign to harness the power of AI and compete with China, which is seeking to become the global leader in the field by 2030. That US push dovetails with the intelligence community&#x27;s struggle to process the vast amounts of data that&#x27;s now publicly available, amid criticism that it&#x27;s been slow to exploit that source. The CIA&#x27;s AI tool will allow users to see the original source of the information that they&#x27;re viewing, Nixon said. He said that a chat feature is a logical part of getting intelligence distributed quicker.

                              <span>The Federal Trade Commission and 17 states on Tuesday sued Amazon, alleging the online retailer illegally wields monopoly power that keeps prices artificially high, locks sellers into its platform and harms its rivals. WSJ: The FTC&#x27;s lawsuit, filed in Seattle federal court, marks a milestone in the Biden administration&#x27;s aggressive approach to enforcing antitrust laws and has been anticipated for months. The agency&#x27;s chair, Lina Khan, is a longtime critic of Amazon who wrote in the Yale Law Journal in 2017 that earlier generations of competition cops and courts abandoned the law&#x27;s concerns over conglomerates such as Amazon. The FTC and states alleged that Amazon violated antitrust laws by using anti-discounting measures that punished merchants for offering lower prices elsewhere. The government also said sellers on Amazon were compelled to use its logistics service if they want their goods to appear in Amazon Prime, the subscription program whose perks include faster shipping times, the FTC said.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Why is it that so many companies that rely on monetizing the data of their users seem to be extremely hot on AI? If you ask Signal president Meredith Whittaker (and I did), she&#x27;ll tell you it&#x27;s simply because &quot;AI is a surveillance technology.&quot; Onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023, Whittaker explained her perspective that AI is largely inseparable from the big data and targeting industry perpetuated by the likes of Google and Meta, as well as less consumer-focused but equally prominent enterprise and defense companies. &quot;It requires the surveillance business model; it&#x27;s an exacerbation of what we&#x27;ve seen since the late &#x27;90s and the development of surveillance advertising. AI is a way, I think, to entrench and expand the surveillance business model,&quot; she said. 

&quot;The Venn diagram is a circle.&quot; &quot;And the use of AI is also surveillant, right?&quot; she continued. &quot;You know, you walk past a facial recognition camera that&#x27;s instrumented with pseudo-scientific emotion recognition, and it produces data about you, right or wrong, that says &#x27;you are happy, you are sad, you have a bad character, you&#x27;re a liar, whatever.&#x27; These are ultimately surveillance systems that are being marketed to those who have power over us generally: our employers, governments, border control, etc., to make determinations and predictions that will shape our access to resources and opportunities.&quot;

Accessing personal information from customers is a serious matter. With the launch of HEY in 2020, we developed some technology and processes to support a very simple principle: employees shouldn’t have access — intentionally or unintentionally — to personal information from our users without their explicit consent. In this post, I’ll show what this looks like in practice.

The programmer side
A few weeks ago, I was On-call and worked on a tricky HEY support ticket that involved email aliases. After some back and forth, I realized I needed access to some email addresses we stored in the database. Those are encrypted since they are personal information, so I reached out to the customer to ask for access permission:

One for to-dos, one for file storage, one for scheduling, one for a message board, and so on. One of those tools is called &quot;Campfire&quot;. Campfire is a real-time group chat. Think of it like Slack, but built right into Basecamp so you don&#x27;t need Slack or anything else just to chat with your team in real-time.
Now most tools in Basecamp have very simple, self-explanatory names. To-dos for to-dos... Messages for messages... Schedule for events... Docs &amp; Files for, you guessed it, documents and files... Etc. There are two tools with &quot;special&quot; names: Campfire (group chat), and Card Table (for our unique take on kanban).

                              <span>Walter Isaacson&#x27;s new book about Elon Musk is a fine biography, but an even better business book. And like all the best business books, it&#x27;s not merely an instruction manual, but an inspirational guide too. Not since reading Ricardo Semler&#x27;s Maverick in the early 2000s have I been this impressed with the foresight, fortitude, and ferocity of a founder. Musk is truly one of a kind.
I know positive statements like that about Musk can trigger some people. Most have already formed their opinion of the man, and, especially in technology, it&#x27;s typically a polarized one. Either the man is the second coming of capitalist christ or he&#x27;s the devil&#x27;s conman incarnate. Ironically, like many of the most interesting people to ever grace this earth, there are shimmers of truth in both caricatures.
That&#x27;s…</span>

                              <span>In GNOME Shell there&#x27;s a dark background for the Quick Settings menu, the calendar applet, and desktop notification-- but in Ubuntu 23.10, &quot;the default Yaru theme uses a light style for GNOME Shell elements,&quot; according to the blog OMG Ubuntu. 

&quot;But there&#x27;s a new GNOME extension that lets you change this without affecting the rest of your desktop...&quot;

You can make GNOME Shell dark in Ubuntu by turning the &#x27;Dark Style&#x27; toggle on but that also makes apps use a dark theme too. Not everyone wants that; they want a &#x27;mixed&#x27; look... [I]f you would like to use dark GNOME Shell elements in Ubuntu 23.10 without using the dark mode preference (which, as said, will turn your apps dark too) then the Dark Style GNOME extension is exactly what you need. 
It only works with Ubuntu 23.10 and GNOME 45.

                              <span>As of Rust 1.74 (to be released on November 16th, 2023), the minimum version of Apple&#x27;s platforms (iOS, macOS, and tvOS) that the Rust toolchain supports will be increased to newer baselines. These changes affect both the Rust compiler itself (rustc), other host tooling, and most importantly, the standard library and any binaries produced that use it. With these changes in place, any binaries produced will stop loading on older versions or exhibit other, unspecified, behavior.
The new minimum versions are now:
macOS: 10.12 Sierra (First released 2016)
iOS: 10 (First released 2016)
tvOS: 10 (First released 2016)
If your application does not target or support macOS 10.7-10.11 or iOS 7-9 already these changes most likely do not affect you.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this report from the New York Times&#x27; media reporter:

In a nondescript office park minutes from Disneyland sits a nondescript warehouse. Inside this nameless, faceless building, an era is ending. 

The building is a Netflix DVD distribution plant. Once a bustling ecosystem that processed 1.2 million DVDs a week, employed 50 people and generated millions of dollars in revenue, it now has just six employees left to sift through the metallic discs. And even that will cease on Friday, when Netflix officially shuts the door on its origin story and stops mailing out its trademark red envelopes. &quot;It&#x27;s sad when you get to the end, because it&#x27;s been a big part of all of our lives for so long,&quot; Hank Breeggemann, the general manager of Netflix&#x27;s DVD division, said in an interview. &quot;But everything runs its cycle. We had a great 25-year run and changed the entertainment industry, the way people viewed movies at home.&quot; 
When Netflix began mailing DVDs in 1998 — the first movie shipped was &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; — no one in Hollywood expected the company to eventually upend the entire entertainment industry... At its height, Netflix was the Postal Service&#x27;s fifth-largest customer, operating 58 shipping facilities and 128 shuttle locations that allowed Netflix to serve 98.5 percent of its customer base with one-day delivery... 

Netflix&#x27;s DVD operations still serve around one million customers, many of them very loyal... To ease the backlash, Netflix is allowing its DVD customers to hold on to their final rentals.
 
&quot;One hundred people at Netflix still work on the DVD side of the business, though most will soon be leaving the company.&quot;

Ironically, within hours a different Brightline train had struck and killed a pedestrian. &quot;Brightline trains have the highest death rate in the U.S.,&quot; reports one local news station, &quot;fatally striking 98 people since Miami-West Palm operations began — about one death for every 32,000 miles its trains travel, accordi…</span>

Troy is very careful with how he handles what he finds. He only collects (and encrypts) the mobile numbers, emails and passwords that he finds in the breaches, discarding the victims&#x27; names, physical addresses, bank details and other sensitive information. The idea is to let users find out where their data has been leaked from, but without exposing them to further risk. Once he identifies where a da…</span>

Analysis of the main chip inside the Mate 60 Pro smartphone, which launched at the end of last month and immediately sold out, reveals that Huawei has joined the elite group of Big Tech companies capable of designing their own semiconductors. Four of the eight central processing units in the Mate 60 Pro&#x27;s &quot;system on a chip&quot; (SoC) rely purely on a design by Arm, the British company whose chip architecture powers 99 percent of smartphones. The other four CPUs are Arm-based but feature Huawei&#x27;s own designs and adaptations, according to three people familia…</span>

That sample has just returned. 

Throughout Sunday morning, NASA tweeted historic updates from the sample&#x27;s landing site in Utah. &quot;We&#x27;ve spotted the #OSIRISREx capsule on the ground,&quot; they announced about 80 minutes ago (including a 23-second video clip). &quot;The parachute has separated, and the helicopters are arriving at the site. We&#x27;re ready to recover that sample!&quot; 

UPI notes that the capsule &quot;reached temperatures up to 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit during reentry, so protective masks and gloves are required to handle it,&quot; describing its payload as &quot;a 250-gram dust sample.&quot;

There is a theoretical, magic tipping point for adoption of electric vehicles. Once somewhere between 5 and 10 percent of new car sales are all-electric, some researchers say, huge numbers of drivers will follow. They predict that electric car sales will then soar — to 25 percent, 50 percent and eventually to close to 80 percent of new sales. Early adopters who love shiny new technologies will be replaced by mainstream consumers just looking for a good deal. Last year, the United States finally passed that elusive mark — 5 percent of all new cars sold in the fourth quarter were fully electric. And earlier this year, all-electric vehicles made up about 7 percent of new car sales... 

If the pattern holds, the United States should start to see rapid growth in the next few years. And automakers have gone all-in on the transition. As of early 2023, U.S.-based car companies have announced about $173 billion in spending to shift to electric vehicles. Volkswagen, Ford, BMW, General Motors, and many more car companies are all making electric cars. There are more than 40 all-electric models on offer in the United States. 
The article points out that in Norway, more than 80% of cars purchased are now fully electric. 

For comparision, in the first half of 2023 in California, about 25% of new-car purchases were electric vehicles.

The newspaper argues that TikTok&#x27;s &quot;friends&quot; in the U.S. government — backed by billionaire financier Jeff Yass — &quot;helped stall attempts to outlaw America&#x27;s most-downloaded app.&quot;

Yass&#x27;s investment company, Susquehanna International Group, bet big on TikTok in 2012, buying a stake in parent company ByteDance now measured at about 15%. That translates into a personal stake for Yass of 7% in ByteDance. It is worth roughly $21 billion based on the company&#x27;s recent valuation, or much of his $28 billion net worth as gauged by Bloomberg.

                              <span>America&#x27;s Department of Defense recently exercised a contract option with X-energy, a private nuclear reactor engineering company, seeking &quot;a thorough analysis of design options&quot; for a transportable micro nuclear reactor. The Department says its ultimate goal is &quot;a reactor design which is ready for licensing by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for both commercial ventures and military resiliency.&quot; 
Their announcement also notes that additional work is already underway by another company, BWX Technologies, on a prototype micro reactor:

&quot;Due to their extraordinary energy density, nuclear reactors have the potential to serve multiple critical functions for meeting resiliency needs in contested logistical environments,&quot; said Dr. Jeff Waksman, Project Pele program manager. &quot;By developing two unique designs, we will provide the Services with a broad range of options as they consider potential uses of nuclear power for both Installation and Operational energy applications in the near future.&quot; 

The Defense Department uses approximately 30 Terawatt-hours of electricity per year and more than 10 million gallons of fuel per day — levels that are only expected to increase due to anticipated electrification of the vehicle fleet and maturation of future energy-intensive capabilities. A safe, small, transportable nuclear reactor would address this growing demand with a resilient, carbon-free energy source that does not add to the Defense Department&#x27;s fuel needs, while supporting mission-critical operations in remote and austere environments... 

&quot;The Strategic Capabilities Office specializes in adapting commercial technology for military purposes,&quot; said Jay Dryer, director. &quot;By nurturing and developing multiple micro reactor designs, SCO will not just provide options for the military Services, but will also help jumpstart a truly competitive commercial marketplace for micro reactors.&quot;

                              <span>&quot;Since 2022, Google has worked with iFixit to offer official repair parts and guides for virtually all of the company&#x27;s Pixel releases,&quot; according to the blog 9to5Google, which in June confirmed this would continue with Google&#x27;s Pixel Fold. (They called the announcement &quot;notable, as it will be the first foldable to date with support for DIY repair options.&quot;)

 But Ars Technica has a warning about Google&#x27;s &quot;biggest and most expensive phone.&quot; The good news is Google has indeed started offering OEM replacement parts for the $1,800 phone on the repair site iFixit. 

The bad news is a repair kit for the phone&#x27;s inner display, a 7.6-inch flexible OLED screen, &quot;will cost you a whopping $900.&quot;
Even the &quot;part only&quot; option for $900 is the entire top half of the Pixel Fold. We&#x27;re talking the display, the bezels around it, the entire metal frame and sides of the phone, the all-important hinge, side buttons, fingerprint sensor, and a whole bunch of wires. You wouldn&#x27;t buy this and connect it to your original phone; you would part out your original phone and move a few pieces over into this, like the motherboard, batteries, cameras, and back plate... 

The outer screen is a much more reasonable $160, while the rear glass cover and camera bump is $70. The batteries — there are two, remember — will run you $50 each... 

Once you get the parts you need, it really feels like iFixit went all out in the guide department, with 32 different guides and &quot;techniques&quot; detailing how to disassemble the Pixel Fold.

                              <span>70 million Americans live in a county without a newspaper, according to a 2022 report cited in this editorial by the Washington Post&#x27;s editorial board&quot; 
Who&#x27;s to blame? The internet, mostly. Whereas deep-pocketed advertisers formerly relied on newspapers to reach their customers, they took to the audience-targeting capabilities of Facebook or Google. Web-based marketplaces also siphoned newspapers&#x27; once-robust revenue from classified ads. 

But the Post emphasizes one positive new development: &quot;a large pile of cash.&quot;

In an initiative announced this month, 22 donor organizations, including the Knight Foundation and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, are teaming up to provide more than $500 million to boost local news over five years — an undertaking called Press Forward... The injection of more than a half-billion dollars is sure to help the quest for a durable and replicable business model. 

The even bigger imperative, however, is to elevate local news on the philanthropic food chain so that national and hometown funders prioritize this pivotal American institution. Failure on this front places more pressure on public policy solutions, and government activism mixes poorly with independent journalism... 



One of the goals for Press Forward, accordingly, is building out the infrastructure — &quot;from legal support to membership programs&quot; — relied upon by local news providers to deliver their product. Jim Brady, vice president of journalism at the Knight Foundation, says it&#x27;s easier than ever for news entrepreneurs to launch a local site because they can plug into existing technologies hammered out by their predecessors — and there&#x27;s more development work still to fund on this front. 

So where to go from here? Local philanthropic interests across the country could take a cue from the Press Forward partners and invest in the news organizations down the street.

                              <span>From science fiction author/blogger/technology activist Cory Doctorow:

Right to repair has no cannier, more dedicated adversary than Apple, a company whose most innovative work is dreaming up new ways to sneakily sabotage electronics repair while claiming to be a caring environmental steward, a lie that covers up the mountains of e-waste that Apple dooms our descendants to wade through... Tim Cook laid it out for his investors: when people can repair their devices, they don&#x27;t buy new ones. When people don&#x27;t buy new devices, Apple doesn&#x27;t sell them new devices. It&#x27;s that&#x27;s simple... 

Specifically Doctorow is criticizing the way Apple equips parts with a tiny system-on-a-chip just to track serial numbers solely &quot;to prevent independent repair technicians from fixing your gadget.&quot;

For Apple…</span>

                              <span>&quot;New York City is now turning to robots to help patrol the Times Square subway station,&quot; quipped one local newscast. 

The non-profit New York City blog Gothamist describes the robot as &quot;almost as tall as the mayor — but at least three-times as wide around the waist,&quot; with a maximum speed of 3 miles per hour-- but a 360-degree field of vision, equipped with four cameras to send live video (without audio) to the police.
A 420-pound, 5-foot-2-inch robocop with a giant camera for a face will begin patrolling the Times Square subway station overnight, the New York Police Department announced Friday morning. At a press conference held underground in the 42nd Street subway station, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said the city is launching a two-month pilot program to test the Knightscope K5 Auto…</span>

                              <span>First the Washington Post summarizes what scientists believed in the 1970s. Chlorofluorocarbons, or (CFCs, &quot;could float up into the stratosphere and break down a protective layer of ozone, allowing more ultraviolet light to enter the atmosphere and harm humans, crops, and entire ecosystems. In fact, this had already happened: There was a hole in the ozone layer over the South Pole.&quot;

Experts view the subsequent treaty to cut down on the use of CFCs — the 1987 Montreal Protocol — as a landmark environmental achievement. Scientists estimate that the pact has prevented millions of cases of skin cancer. Today, the ozone hole is recovering well. But a provocative scientific paper published Friday in the journal AGU Advances suggests that the link between the ozone layer and human health is more…</span>

                              <span>A startup named OceanWell has partnered with southern California&#x27;s Las Virgenes Municipal Water District &quot;to study the feasibility of harvesting drinking water from desalination pods placed on the ocean floor,&quot; reports the Los Angeles Times:

The company says that by combining desalination with off-shore energy technology, it can solve many of the challenges associated with traditional, land-based desalination, including high energy costs and salty byproducts that threaten marine life. The process could produce as much as 10 million gallons of fresh water per day — a significant gain for an inland district almost entirely reliant on imported supplies... 

OceanWell says its technology can use up to 40% less energy by harvesting the water in pods placed at depths of about 1,400 feet, where naturally immense water pressure can help power the filtration process... Land-based facilities try to squeeze out as much freshwater as possible to help balance high energy costs, with typical targets of 50% freshwater and 50% brine from every gallon processed. But because OceanWell uses &quot;free&quot; pressure from the ocean, it can operate at a lower recovery rate of 10% to 15%, producing a much less salty byproduct that can be dissolved back into ambient conditions within seconds, she said... 

The partnership with Las Virgenes will allow OceanWell to &quot;stress test&quot; the technology&#x27;s capabilities in the reservoir and collect more data, said Kalyn Simon, OceanWell&#x27;s director of engagement. The current goal is to be fully operational by 2028, producing an estimated 10 million gallons of freshwater per day.

                              <span>CNN reports:

The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection [known as Cal Fire] says it has a new tool to battle wildfires before they explode — artificial intelligence. &quot;I think it is a game changer ... It has enhanced our abilities to validate situational awareness and then respond in a quick fashion,&quot; Phillip SeLegue, Cal Fire&#x27;s staff chief for fire intelligence, told CNN. 

 Deep in the California wilderness of the Cleveland National Forest in San Diego County, a fire started in the middle of a July night. No fire officials were in the area, but AI was watching and alerted the authorities. &quot;The dispatch center there was not aware of the fire,&quot; said Scott Slumpff, battalion chief of the intel program at Cal Fire, who was testing the new technology at the time and received the initial alert. Cal Fire, in partnership with the University of California at San Diego&#x27;s Alert California program and its network of more than 1,000 cameras across the state, is using the technology to spot fires early. &quot;The camera had done its 360 [degree turn], identified an anomaly, stopped and was zoomed in,&quot; Slumpff explained. He then confirmed it was a fire and immediately dispatched resources. &quot;They were able to hold it to a 10 by 10 [foot] spot out in the middle of the forest...&quot; 

The pilot program was so successful, Cal Fire expanded the technology at the beginning of September to all 21 of its dispatch centers across the state... Cal Fire says 40% of fires since July 10 have been detected by AI before a 911 call was received — and the technology is continuing to learn and improve. 
&quot;We have multiple successes of fires at night that had gone undetected that we were able to suppress before a 911 call had even come into the command centers,&quot; Cal Fire&#x27;s staff chief for fire intelligence, told CNN. 


&quot;The fires you don&#x27;t hear about in the news is the greatest success.&quot;

                              <span>&quot;As more companies enforce their office mandates, some workers are choosing to quit instead of complying and returning to the office,&quot; reports the Washington Post.

Workers say their reasons for quitting include everything from family to commuting expenses to being required to relocate. And many workers worry that people like those with disabilities or who are primary caregivers may be left behind due to their inability to successfully work from the office... Workers are pushing back, penning letters to executives, staging walkouts and quitting despite the tight labor market. &quot;I&#x27;m not surprised at all,&quot; Prithwiraj Choudhury, a Harvard Business School professor who studies the future of work, said about workers quitting. &quot;By mandating these rigid policies, you&#x27;re risking your top performers and diversity. It just doesn&#x27;t make economic sense.&quot; 

Choudhury said companies should provide overall guidance that allows each to determine how they best work after analysis and feedback from workers. That&#x27;s especially important for women, whom Choudhury said are resigning in large numbers — a notion multiple surveys support... For some workers who moved or were hired remotely during the pandemic, commuting is a nearly impossible task, they say. 

In a related note, Grindr tells the Post they&#x27;re still requiring two-days-per-week in the office starting in October. Grindr they&#x27;re looking forward to &quot;further improving productivity and collaboration.&quot;

The Indian Space Research Organization, India&#x27;s equivalent of NASA, said on Friday that mission controllers on the ground had sent a wake-up message to Vikram. The lander, as expected, did not reply. Efforts will continue over the next few days, but this could well be the conclusion of Chandrayaan-3, India&#x27;s first successful space mission to the surface of another world... 

The hope was that when sunlight again warmed the solar panels, the spacecraft would recharge and revive. But that was wishful thinking. Neither Vikram nor Pragyan were designed to survive a long, frigid lunar night when temperatures plunge to more than…</span>

Their alliance with the &quot;Scattered Spider&quot; group is described as &quot;part of a trend that has alarmed security experts and defenders of corporate computer networks.&quot; The group is said to be &quot;very active in the past two years, targeting large companies via stolen employee credentials and tricks such as convincing tech support employees that they have been accidentally locked out of their computers and need a new password.&quot;

They moved from cryptocurrency thefts to targeting businesses that provide third-party business functions such as help desks and call center staff…</span>

                              <span>The use of AI in the economy presents many unanswered questions for policymakers though there is some evidence that it could improve labor productivity, according to Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. From a report: &quot;The impact of AI on the economy and monetary policy will depend on whether AI is just another app or something more profound,&quot; Cook said in remarks prepared for delivery at the National Bureau of Economic Research&#x27;s conference on artificial intelligence in Toronto Friday. &quot;Empirical evidence is still patchy, but there is work showing that generative AI improves productivity in a variety of settings.&quot; 

Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Fed&#x27;s board, was among central bank officials who on Wednesday voted unanimously to hold rates steady in a range of 5.25% to 5.5%. President Joe Biden named Cook as a governor on the board last year. She was endorsed for a full 14-year term in a 51-47 Senate vote earlier this month. Cook predicted that greater use of AI will be similar to the spread of computation in the workplace and could present &quot;a difficult transition for some workers. [...] Any large change in the labor force will generate disruptions and challenges that will need to be addressed to help workers adapt and thrive.&quot;

                              <span>Meredith Whittaker, the president of the Signal Foundation, which maintains the nonprofit Signal messaging app, reaffirmed that Signal would leave the U.K. if the country&#x27;s recently passed Online Safety Bill forced Signal to build &quot;backdoors&quot; into its end-to-end encryption. From a report: &quot;We would leave the U.K. or any jurisdiction if it came down to the choice between backdooring our encryption and betraying the people who count on us for privacy, or leaving,&quot; Whittaker said. &quot;And that&#x27;s never not true.&quot; The Online Safety Bill, which was passed into law in September, includes a clause -- clause 122 -- that, depending on how it&#x27;s interpreted, could allow the U.K.&#x27;s communications regulator, Ofcom, to break the encryption of apps and services under the guise of making sure illegal material such as child sexual exploitation and abuse content is removed. 

Ofcom could fine companies not in compliance up to $22.28 million, or 10% of their global annual revenue, under the bill -- whichever is greater. Whittaker didn&#x27;t mince words in airing her fears about the Online Safety Bill&#x27;s implications. &quot;We&#x27;re not about political stunts, so we&#x27;re not going to just pick up our toys and go home to, like, show the bad U.K. they&#x27;re being mean,&quot; she said. &quot;We&#x27;re really worried about people in the U.K. who would live under a surveillance regime like the one that seems to be teased by the Home Office and others in the U.K.&quot;

                              <span>In 2019, CD Projekt Red unexpectedly announced Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s 2020 release, surprising some employees. Released in December 2020, it faced bugs and issues, symbolizing industry crunch. However, post-release updates, particularly in 2022, significantly improved the game, leading some to praise its transformation. A Kotaku critic wrote that the game &quot;might finally be complete.&quot; But CD Projekt Red wasn&#x27;t finished just yet. Now, in September 2023, the Cyberpunk 2077 saga is coming to an end with two final, major releases:

1. The 2.0 patch, which came out Sept. 21 and overhauls many of the game&#x27;s core mechanics.
2. Phantom Liberty, an expansion starring Idris Elba that&#x27;s out on Sept. 26. 

Bloomberg adds: Both appear to be excellent. The expansion adds a new area to the game&#x27;s dystopian Night City and tells a heist story in which you team up with the president and government spooks. It has received glowing reviews from critics, with IGN declaring that, &quot;Phantom Liberty is Cyberpunk 2077 at its best.&quot; New content is great, but it&#x27;s the 2.0 patch that makes the biggest impact on Cyberpunk 2077, with changes that are made immediately apparent when you open up the game. The menus are cleaner, the loot system is less convoluted and character building feels completely different thanks to a revamped skill system that allows for more distinct playstyles. You can now specialize, transforming your character into a stealthy ninja, a speedy assaulter or a cybernetic hacker. 

Cyberpunk 2077&#x27;s biggest problem, aside from the bugs, was its uncertainty over whether it wanted to be Deus Ex or Grand Theft Auto. It straddled the line between deep role-playing game and systemic open-world sandbox, ultimately feeling like an inferior version of both. Although the new patch doesn&#x27;t pick a side in this divide, it does bolster them. The new level system allows for the type of build experimentation that RPG fans were hoping to see in Cyberpunk 2077.

                              <span>The prestigious Lasker Awards were given this week to scientists making advances in the diagnosis of eye disease, the prediction of cellular protein structure and the intricacies of the immune system. The awards, closely watched by researchers in biomedical fields, often foreshadow Nobel Prizes. The New York Times adds: The Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award was given to a team of three scientists, led by James G. Fujimoto, a professor of electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who helped invent optical coherence tomography. The technology can detect conditions like macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy earlier than previous methods, preventing blindness. O.C.T. now is commonly used in ophthalmology offices, where the patient simply rests a chin and forehead against an instrument for a brief scan. 

The method, invented in 1991, offers a staggering amount of detail about the retina, a layer of tissue at the back of the eye critical to vision. &quot;It&#x27;s not much thicker than a strand of hair, but it has 10 internal layers,&quot; said Dr. David Huang, an ophthalmologist at the Casey Eye Institute at Oregon Health &amp; Science University who helped to invent the method. Before O.C.T., an ophthalmologist could dilate a patient&#x27;s eyes with eye drops to enlarge the pupil, and then use a magnifying lens and special light to examine the retina. An O.C.T. scan &quot;can measure the thickness of the retina, the fluid pockets in it and the abnormal blood vessel growth,&quot; detecting small lesions that have not yet caused symptoms, Dr. Huang added.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: China&#x27;s craze over generative artificial intelligence has triggered a flurry of product announcements from startups and tech giants on an almost daily basis, but investors are warning a shakeout is imminent as cost and profit pressures grow. The buzz in China, first ignited by the success of OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT almost a year ago, has given rise to what a senior Tencent executive described this month as &quot;war of a hundred models&quot;, as it and rivals from Baidu to Alibaba to Huawei promote their offerings. China now has at least 130 large language models, accounting for 40% of the global total and just behind the United States&#x27; 50% share, according to brokerage CLSA. 

Additionally, companies have also announced dozens of &quot;industry-specific LLMs&quot; that link to their core model. However, investors and analysts say that most were yet to find viable business models, were too similar to each other and were now grappling with surging costs. Tensions between Beijing and Washington have also weighed on the sector, as U.S. dollar funds invest less in early-stage projects and difficulties obtaining AI chips made by the likes of Nvidia start to bite. &quot;Only those with the strongest capabilities will survive,&quot; said Esme Pau, head of China internet and digital asset research at Macquarie Group, who expects consolidation and a price war as players compete for users.

                              <span>The European Commission has re-imposed a fine of about $400 million on chipmaker Intel for abusing its dominant position in the x86 processor market. The move is the latest twist in an antitrust saga that has been now running for more than two decades. The Register: According to the Commission, the fine is in response to previously established anticompetitive practices by the silicon giant, aimed at excluding competitors from the market in breach of EU competition rules. The original fine handed to Intel in 2009 was for $1.2 billion, based on findings that the company had given incentives to PC makers to use its CPUs instead of those from rivals, or else delay the launch of specific products containing rival chips. 

These incentives consisted of wholly or partially hidden rebates for using Intel chips, or payments in order to delay launching products with rival chips, amounting to so-called &quot;naked restrictions.&quot; It ultimately goes back to complaints from rival CPU maker AMD in 2000 and again in 2003 that Intel was engaging in anticompetitive conduct by offering rebates to vendors to favor Intel components. Intel fought the decision, but an appeal by the Silicon Valley outfit to have it overturned was initially denied in 2014. Then in 2022, the EU General Court partially annulled the 2009 ruling by the Commission, in particular the findings related to Intel&#x27;s conditional rebates, and went on to nix the fine imposed on the company in its entirety.

                              <span>NASA, in a press release: Jupiter&#x27;s moon Europa is one of a handful of worlds in our solar system that could potentially harbor conditions suitable for life. Previous research has shown that beneath its water-ice crust lies a salty ocean of liquid water with a rocky seafloor. However, planetary scientists had not confirmed if that ocean contained the chemicals needed for life, particularly carbon. Astronomers using data from NASA&#x27;s James Webb Space Telescope have identified carbon dioxide in a specific region on the icy surface of Europa. 

Analysis indicates that this carbon likely originated in the subsurface ocean and was not delivered by meteorites or other external sources. Moreover, it was deposited on a geologically recent timescale. This discovery has important implications for the potential habitability of Europa&#x27;s ocean. &quot;On Earth, life likes chemical diversity -- the more diversity, the better. We&#x27;re carbon-based life. Understanding the chemistry of Europa&#x27;s ocean will help us determine whether it&#x27;s hostile to life as we know it, or if it might be a good place for life,&quot; said Geronimo Villanueva of NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, lead author of one of two independent papers describing the findings. &quot;We now think that we have observational evidence that the carbon we see on Europa&#x27;s surface came from the ocean. That&#x27;s not a trivial thing. Carbon is a biologically essential element,&quot; added Samantha Trumbo of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, lead author of the second paper analyzing these data. NASA plans to launch its Europa Clipper spacecraft, which will perform dozens of close flybys of Europa to further investigate whether it could have conditions suitable for life, in October 2024.

                              <span>The White House is considering requiring cloud computing firms to report some information about their customers to the U.S. government, Semafor reported Friday, citing people familiar with an upcoming executive order on AI. From the report: The provision would direct the Commerce Department to write rules forcing cloud companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon to disclose when a customer purchases computing resources beyond a certain threshold. The order hasn&#x27;t been finalized and specifics of it could still change. Similar &quot;know-your-customer&quot; policies already exist in the banking sector to prevent money laundering and other illegal activities, such as the law mandating firms to report cash transactions exceeding $10,000. 

In this case, the rules are intended to create a system that would allow the U.S. government to identify potential AI threats ahead of time, particularly those coming from entities in foreign countries. If a company in the Middle East began building a powerful large language model using Amazon Web Services, for example, the reporting requirement would theoretically give American authorities an early warning about it. The policy proposal represents a potential step toward treating computing power -- or the technical capacity AI systems need to perform tasks -- like a national resource. Mining Bitcoin, developing video games, and running AI models like ChatGPT all require large amounts of compute.

                              <span>The Federal Communications Commission is taking steps to restrict Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) providers from easily accessing US telephone numbers. Over the past several years, robocallers have exploited VoIP providers to inundate US citizens with unwanted calls, many of which come from falsified numbers. Previously, the regulations allowed VoIP services relatively uncomplicated access to US phone numbers. ArsTechnica: But under rules adopted by the FCC yesterday, VoIP providers will face some extra hurdles. They will have to &quot;make robocall-related certifications to help ensure compliance with the Commission&#x27;s rules targeting illegal robocalls,&quot; and &quot;disclose and keep current information about their ownership, including foreign ownership, to mitigate the risk of providing bad actors abroad with access to US numbering resources,&quot; the FCC said. The FCC order will take effect 30 days after it&#x27;s published in the Federal Register. A public draft of the order was released ahead of the FCC meeting.

                              <span>Unity has announced some key changes to its widely panned Runtime Fee policy, which spawned both derision and confusion from developers and the gaming community at large when it was unveiled earlier this month. From a report: It&#x27;s easing up on some big aspects of the previously announced charges, removing the fee from the Unity Personal tier entirely, although it still remains in a revised form on the Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise tiers. In short, as originally announced, starting on Jan. 1, 2024, Unity would start charging developers a small fee every time someone downloads a game built on Unity&#x27;s game engine after a certain threshold for minimum revenue and install count. 

The different tiers of Unity plans - Unity Personal/Unity Plus, Unity Pro, and Unity Enterprise - had different thresholds and, per the original announcement, smaller developers using Unity Personal/Unity Plus would have to pay Unity $0.20 per install once their game passes $200,000 in revenue over the last 12 months and 200,000 life-to-date installs. Unity announced today, however, that there will be no Runtime Fee on games built on Unity Personal, which will remain free. They will also be increasing financial theshold of Unity Personal from $100,000 to $200,000 and will remove the requirement to use the Made with Unity splash screen.

                              <span>schwit1 writes: China&#x27;s exports of two rare minerals essential for manufacturing semiconductors fell to zero in August, a month after Beijing imposed curbs on sales overseas, citing national security. China produces about 80% of the world&#x27;s gallium and about 60% of germanium, according to the Critical Raw Materials Alliance, but it didn&#x27;t sell any of the elements on international markets last month, Chinese customs data released on Wednesday showed. In July, the country exported 5.15 metric tons of forged gallium products and 8.1 metric tons of forged germanium products. 

When asked about the lack of exports last month, He Yadong, a spokesperson from China&#x27;s commerce ministry told a press briefing Thursday that the department had received applications from companies to export the two materials. Some applications had been approved, he said, without elaborating. The curbs are indicative of China&#x27;s apparent willingness to retaliate against US export controls, despite concerns about economic growth, as a tech war simmers.Nobody ever said weaning ourselves off the CCP would be easy, Schwit1 adds.

                              <span>The U.S. Treasury Department and China&#x27;s Ministry of Finance launched a pair of economic working groups on Friday in an effort to ease tensions and deepen ties between the nations. From a report: Led by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Vice Premier He Lifeng, the working groups will be divided into economic and financial segments. The working groups will &quot;establish a durable channel of communication between the world&#x27;s two largest economies,&quot; Yellen said in a series of tweets detailing the announcement. She said the groups will &quot;serve as important forums to communicate America&#x27;s interests and concerns, promote a healthy economic competition between our two countries with a level playing field for American workers and businesses.&quot; 

The announcement follows a string of high-ranking administration officials&#x27; visits to China this year, which sets the stage for a possible meeting between President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in November at an Asia-Pacific economic conference in San Francisco. China is one of the United States&#x27; biggest trading partners, and economic competition between the two nations has increased in recent years. The two finance ministers have agreed to meet at a &quot;regular cadence,&quot; the Treasury Department said in a news release.

                              <span>In his first major public interview since the DMV cut their San Francisco fleet in half, Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt said &quot;we cannot expect perfection&quot; from the self-driving cars, and vaguely threatened to leave town if regulators curtail them any further. From a report: The self-driving robotaxis of GM subsidiary Cruise and Google-owned Waymo seemed like they were heading in a successful direction when they won approval from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) last month to run their self-driving robotaxis at all hours in SF without restrictions. But barely a week later, the California DMV demanded Cruise cut it SF fleet in half, following post-Outside Lands stalling incidents, a night of multiple accidents, and SF City Attorney David Chiu filing a motion to get the CPUC to reverse their decision. 

Cruse CEO Kyle Vogt sat down for a (very friendly) 40-minute interview Wednesday at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference, which can be seen in its entirety above. And he seems to be going on offense against the regulatory pushback his company is getting from SF and California lawmakers. &quot;It&#x27;s kind of fun as a society to poke at the differences between AVs (autonomous vehicles) and humans, but if we&#x27;re serious about safety in our cities, we should be rolling out the red carpet for AVs,&quot; Vogt said, according to the SF Standard.

                              <span>How many smartphone brands do you think have left the market since 2017? The likes of LG probably come to mind, then there are the many local, lesser-known brands. Maybe fifty, or one hundred? The actual figure is, astoundingly, nearly 500. TechSpot: Counterpoint Research&#x27;s analysis shows that at its peak in 2017, there were more than 700 smartphone brands contributing to the 1.5 billion units sold annually. In 2023, that number is down by a third to almost 250. Nearly all of those brands that have shuttered over the last five years were local ones found in locations such as India, the Middle East, Africa, China, Japan, and South Korea. The number of global brands such as Samsung has remained consistent at over 30. 

Counterpoint Research highlights several reasons behind the shrinking number of brands over the last seven years. The pandemic and component shortages that began in 2020 had a massive impact, while the global economic slowdown following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has caused many smaller smartphone companies to shutter. The local brands have also been dealing with other factors killing off their businesses. More people are holding onto their devices for longer before upgrading, cheaper phones are improving in quality all the time, there&#x27;s a maturing user base, we&#x27;ve seen technology transitions such as that from 4G to 5G, and a handful of big brands are holding on to more of the market.

                              <span>Amazon, following other streaming platforms looking to further monetize their content, will run ads on its Prime Video service in key markets -- a move that will help offset rising costs and provide a boost to an already robust advertising business. From a report: Ad-supported streaming will be the default on Prime Video in US, UK, Germany and Canada starting early next year, the company said in a statement on Friday. The company has long offered video streaming as part of a package that also includes speedy shipping, music and other perks. Amazon said Prime subsribers will continue to pay $139 annually in the US but will be able to pay an additional $2.99 a month to avoid ads. Pricing in other countries will be anounced later, the company said.

                              <span>Esper: Starting in Android 14, it may not be necessary to use a third-party app to turn your smartphone into a webcam for your PC, as that functionality is getting baked into the Android OS itself -- though there&#x27;s a catch. 

When you plug an Android phone into a PC, you have the option to change the USB mode between file transfer/Android Auto (MTP), USB tethering (NCM), MIDI, or PTP. In Android 14, however, a new option can appear in USB Preferences: USB webcam. Selecting this option switches the USB mode to UVC (USB Video Class), provided the device supports it, turning your Android device into a standard USB webcam that other devices will recognize, including Windows, macOS, and Linux PCs, and possibly even other Android devices. 

Webcam support in Android 14 is not enabled out of the box, however. In order to enable it, four things are required: a Linux kernel config needs to be enabled, the UVC device needs to be configured, the USB HAL needs to be updated, and a new system app needs to be preloaded.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a news story: A report by dappGambl based on data provided by NFT Scan and CoinMarketCap showed that out of 73,257 NFT collections the researchers looked at, 69,795 of them, or slightly over 95%, had a market cap of zero ether. By their estimates, almost 23 million people hold these worthless assets. &quot;This daunting reality should serve as a sobering check on the euphoria that has often surrounded the NFT space,&quot; the researchers said. &quot;Amid stories of digital art pieces selling for millions and overnight success stories, it is easy to overlook the fact that the market is fraught with pitfalls and potential losses.&quot; 

NFTs are digital representations of art or collectibles tied to a blockchain, typically ethereum, and each one has a unique signature that cannot be duplicated. In 2021 and 2022, the NFT market saw a huge bull run, at one point leading to $2.8 billion in monthly trading volume. During that time, popular collections such as Bored Apes and CryptoPunks were selling for millions of dollars, and celebrities such as Stephen Curry and Snoop Dogg participated in the hype. The boom coincided with cryptocurrency&#x27;s peak when bitcoin was trading close to $70,000. On Wednesday, the price of the crypto hovered just above $27,000. dappGambl&#x27;s study shows 79% of all NFT collections currently remain unsold, and the surplus of supply over demand has created a buyer&#x27;s market that isn&#x27;t doing anything to revive enthusiasm.

                              <span>Brazilian engineer Luiz Andre Barroso, who ripped up the rulebook at Google, has died. His radical ideas for data centers laid the foundations for cloud computing. Wired: Luiz Andre Barroso had never designed a data center before Google asked him to do it in the early 2000s. By the time he finished his first, he had overturned many conventions of the computing industry, laying the foundations for Silicon Valley&#x27;s development of cloud computing. 

Barroso, a 22-year veteran of Google who unexpectedly died on September 16 at age 59, built his data centers with low-cost components instead of expensive specialized hardware. He reimagined how they worked together to develop the concept of &quot;the data center as a computer,&quot; which now underpins the web, mobile apps, and other internet services. 

Jen Fitzpatrick, senior vice president of Google&#x27;s infrastructure organization, says Barroso left an indelible imprint at the company whose contributions to the industry are countless. &quot;We lost a beloved friend, colleague and respected leader,&quot; she writes in a statement on behalf of the company.

                              <span>FrankOVD writes: Google is being sued by a widow who says her husband drowned in September 2022 after Google Maps directed him over a collapsed bridge in Hickory, North Carolina. Google failed to correct its map service despite warnings about the broken bridge two years before the accident, according to the lawsuit filed Tuesday by Alicia Paxson in Wake County Superior Court. Philip Paxson &quot;died tragically while driving home from his daughter&#x27;s ninth birthday party, when he drove off of an unmarked, unbarricaded collapsed bridge in Hickory, North Carolina while following GPS directions,&quot; the complaint said. 

The Snow Creek Bridge reportedly collapsed in 2013 and wasn&#x27;t repaired. Barricades were typically in place but &quot;were removed after being vandalized and were missing at the time of Paxson&#x27;s wreck,&quot; according to The Charlotte Observer. The lawsuit has five defendants, including Google and its owner Alphabet. The other defendants are James Tarlton and two local business entities called Tarde, LLC and Hinckley Gauvain, LLC. Tarlton and the two businesses &quot;owned, controlled, and/or were otherwise responsible for the land&quot; containing the bridge, the lawsuit said.

                              <span>Rishi Sunak has vowed to press ahead with watering down key green measures despite intense criticism, because he still believes the UK will hit its net zero target in 2050. From a report: The prime minister defended defying the recommendations of the Climate Change Committee (CCC) and said he had &quot;absolute confidence and belief&quot; the country was on track to meet its end goal. In a BBC radio interview on Thursday morning, Sunak shrugged off suggestions he had ignored the view of the official body that advises governments on reducing emissions. He said: &quot;I&#x27;m very happy to have opinions and advice from everybody, and everyone&#x27;s entitled to their view. We&#x27;re very confident -- being in government, with all the information at our disposal -- that we we are on track to hit all our targets.&quot; 

Sunak told Radio 4&#x27;s Today programme that Margaret Thatcher would have agreed with his rationale, and that it was not right for &quot;working families&quot; to face significant costs as part of the country&#x27;s transition to net zero. But he struggled to provide an explanation for claims he had scrapped measures critics said had never seriously been mooted -- such as an alleged tax on meat, compulsory car sharing and forcing households to use seven recycling bins. &quot;These are all things that have been raised by very credible people,&quot; he argued. When pressed, Sunak was unable to provide evidence that those specific measures had been suggested by anyone and instead said they had been euphemistically advocated for by bodies such as the CCC.

                              <span>Around the end of July the crates.io team opened an RFC to update the current crates.io usage policies. This policy update addresses operational concerns of the crates.io community service that have arisen since the last significant policy update in 2017, particularly related to name squatting and spam. The RFC has caused considerable discussion, and most of the suggested improvements have since been integrated into the proposal.
At the last team meeting the crates.io team decided to move the RFC forward and start the final comment period process.
We have been made aware by a couple of community members though that the RFC might not have been visible enough in the Rust community. We hope that this blog post changes that.
We invite you all to review the RFC and let us know if there are still any major concerns with these proposed policies.
Here is a quick TL;DR:
The current policies are quite vague on a couple of topics. The new policies are more explicit.
Reserving names is still allowed, but only to a certain degree and if you have a good reason for it.
The crates.io team will try to contact crate owners before taking any actions.
Finally, if you have any comments, please open threads on the RFC diff, instead of using the main comment box, to keep the discussion more structured. Thank you!</span>

                              <span>Announcing the Project Director Nominees
Over the past couple weeks, the Rust Leadership Council has been soliciting nominees from the whole Rust project for the role of Project Director.
Now that the nomination period is closed, we are happy to announce the list of nominees.
As described in our last post, we will elect from these people three new Project Directors.
The nominees are:
Jakob Degen
Amanieu d&#x27;Antras
Felix Klock
lcnr
scottmcm
Michael Goulet
Santiago Pastorino
Jubilee
Mara Bos
These were all spoken of highly by their nominating teams.
While several other candidates were suggested, not everyone who was nominated felt like they were in a place where they were able or wanted to accept the role if they were elected.
Now we&#x27;d again like to ask the members of the Rust Project for their feedback.
Please contact the Council in general or your representative(s) to tell us what we should consider going into the election process.
We hope that most of the feedback will be reasons we may not have considered yet for why they will be successful in the role, but if there are areas of necessary growth or other concerns that mean one or more of these nominees may not be a good fit for the role at this time, we want to know this as well!
You may reach out to us either on the public #council channel on Zulip or by emailing the Leadership Council at council@rust-lang.org.
We would also like to acknowledge the conflict of interest with Mara Bos since she is both a nominee and a member of the Leadership Council.
In keeping with the Leadership Council&#x27;s Conflict of Interest policy, Mara will recuse herself from the election process and instead the Libraries team will send an alternate representative to participate in the Project Director election.
We will be open for feedback through October 2, and elections will take place soon afterwards.
We will announce the new Project Directors once the election is complete.</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Google has been trying to publicly pressure Apple into adopting the GSMA&#x27;s RCS (Rich Communications Service) messaging protocol for a long time now, with nothing to show for it. As a matter of fact, Apple CEO Tim Cook seemed to completely dismiss the idea when he answered a question on the subject by saying that consumers should buy their moms an iPhone. Google and its Android platform aren&#x27;t giving up that easily and they&#x27;ve just released a snarky ad to continue criticizing Apple&#x27;s preferred messaging platform. 

The ad&#x27;s called &quot;iPager&quot; and mimics Apple&#x27;s marketing language to reveal a retro-styled beeper, indicating that Apple&#x27;s behind the curve with its chosen messaging platform. The spot states that the iPager uses &quot;outdated messaging tech&quot; to &quot;text with Android,&quot; citing many of the perceived disadvantages of sticking with SMS technology when communicating with Android phones. Google didn&#x27;t invent this comparison whole-cloth, as the 30-year-old SMS tech actually dates back to old-school pagers.

                              <span>Several Slashdot readers have shared this report: Folks, what you&#x27;ve heard so far is true. Apple&#x27;s new FineWoven iPhone cases and accessories are bad. Like, really bad. I&#x27;ve been puzzling over them for the past week, looking at them from different angles. Picking them up, setting them down, petting them. Seven days later, I still can&#x27;t make sense of them and have no other choice but to say it out loud: FineWoven is very bad. FineWoven is a new fabric option you&#x27;ll find on iPhone 15 cases, AirTag holders, and MagSafe wallets. Apple calls it a &quot;luxurious and durable microtwill.&quot; It&#x27;s silky, almost slippery to the touch, and costs $59 for any of the phone cases, $35 for an AirTag holder, and $99 for one of the new watch bands -- not the most expensive phone cases you can buy, but pretty darn pricey. 

Apple is pitching them as a premium replacement of sorts for the leather accessories it discontinued. The company won&#x27;t sell leather iPhone cases and straps anymore because making them at Apple&#x27;s scale &quot;has a significant carbon footprint,&quot; according to Lisa Jackson, the company&#x27;s environmental policy VP. That&#x27;s fair; as my colleague Justine Calma puts it, &quot;Cattle are a big source of greenhouse gas emissions because cows burp out methane, which is even more potent than CO2 when it comes to its ability to trap heat on the planet.&quot; If you want a fancy first-party iPhone case, then your new, more sustainable option would be FineWoven. But FineWoven is very much not the premium material that leather is. When I popped the MagSafe wallet out of its box, I could clearly see some places where it was already showing wear along the edges. Little bits of lint immediately caught on the fabric, too. And then there&#x27;s the fingernail test.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: DuckDuckGo, a privacy-centric search engine founded about 15 years ago, has languished with a small market share as consumers face difficulties switching from Google when the behemoth is the default option on computer screens, the upstart&#x27;s founder said in an antitrust trial. Founded in 2008, DuckDuckGo currently has about a 2.5% share of the market for search in the US, said CEO Gabriel Weinberg, and conducts about 100 million searches a day globally. In comparison, Google conducts several billion searches daily. 

Weinberg said about 30% to 40% of DuckDuckGo&#x27;s users have a &quot;strong preferenceâ for privacy and that most of the company&#x27;s users switch over from Google.&quot; The company considers Google to be &quot;far and away&quot; its biggest competitor. &quot;Switching is way harder than it needs to be,&quot; Chief Executive Officer Gabriel Weinberg said in federal court on Thursday. &quot;There&#x27;s just too many steps.&quot;

                              <span>At an event today focused on AI and security tools and new Surface devices, Microsoft announced that Windows 11 users will soon be able to take better advantage of passkeys, the digital credentials that can be used as an authentication method for websites and apps. From a report: Once the expanded passkeys support rolls out, Windows 11 users will be able to create a passkey using Windows Hello, Windows&#x27; biometric identity and access control feature. They&#x27;ll then be able to use that passkey to access supported webs or apps using their face, fingerprint or PIN. Windows 11 passkeys can be managed on the devices on which they&#x27;re stored, or saved to a mobile phone for added convenience. 

&quot;For the past several years, we&#x27;ve been committed to working with our industry partners and the FIDO Alliance to further the passwordless future with passkeys,&quot; Microsoft wrote in a blog post this morning. &quot;Passkeys are the cross-platform, cross-ecosystem future of accessing websites and applications.&quot; Microsoft began rolling out support for passkey management several months ago in the Windows Insider dev channel, but this marks the capability&#x27;s general availability.

                              <span>MGM Resorts brought to an end a 10-day computer shutdown prompted by efforts to shield from a cyberattack data including hotel reservations and credit card processing, the casino giant said Wednesday, as analysts and academics measured the effects of the event. From a report: &quot;We are pleased that all of our hotels and casinos are operating normally,&quot; the Las Vegas-based company posted on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. It reported last week that the attack was detected Sept. 10. Rival casino owner Caesars Entertainment also disclosed last week to federal regulators that it was hit by a cyberattack Sept. 7. It said that its casino and online operations were not disrupted but it could not guarantee that personal information about tens of millions of customers, including driver&#x27;s licenses and Social Security numbers of loyalty rewards members, had not been compromised. Caesars, based in Reno, is widely reported to have paid $15 million of a $30 million ransom sought by a group called Scattered Spider for a promise to secure the data.

                              <span>Microsoft just showed off its new high-end convertible laptop, the Surface Laptop Studio 2, at its launch event in New York City. The Laptop Studio 2 keeps the overall aesthetic of its predecessor, including the pull-forward 14.4-inch display that makes it a much more touch-friendly device but adds some welcome power-user features. From a report: The Studio 2, which starts at $1,999, runs on Intel&#x27;s 13th Generation chips -- specifically the i7 H class -- with an Nvidia RTX 4050 or RTX 4060 GPU inside. It also has an Intel Neural Processing Unit, or NPU, which is the first Intel NPU in a Windows computer. (There were rumblings that Microsoft might be making this chip itself, but it appears not.) You can configure it with up to 2TB of storage and 64 gigs of RAM. In all, Microsoft says it&#x27;s &quot;the most powerful Surface we&#x27;ve ever built&quot; and promises twice the performance of the previous device. 

The Studio 2 also offers some big new connectivity options: it has two USB-C ports, one USB-A port, a microSD card reader, and the Surface Slim Pen 2. In addition, there&#x27;s a new customizable and more responsive haptic touchpad that Microsoft calls &quot;the most inclusive touchpad on any laptop.&quot;

                              <span>Cisco agreed to buy Splunk in a deal valued at about $28 billion, representing its biggest acquisition yet and a massive push into software and artificial intelligence-powered data analysis. From a report: Cisco will pay $157 a share in cash, the companies said in a statement Thursday, or a 31% premium to Splunk&#x27;s previous closing price on Wednesday. Cisco has been expanding its software and services business in an attempt to rely less on its hallmark networking hardware. The Silicon Valley giant has traditionally generated the bulk of its revenue from equipment that forms the backbone of computer networks, but that&#x27;s been changing. Last month Cisco outlined the headway it&#x27;s making in artificial intelligence and security technology. 

The deal is also arguably just as much a bet on artificial intelligence as it is on the business of software and data security. Earlier this year, Splunk announced a new line of AI offerings that it said would, among other things, allow companies to detect and respond to anomalies in their data faster. The merger offers the companies&#x27; AI products &quot;substantial scale&quot; and more visibility into data, they said in Thursday&#x27;s statement.

                              <span>Microsoft will release its next big Windows 11 update, 23H2, on September 26th. The update will include the new AI-powered Windows Copilot feature, a redesigned File Explorer, a new Ink Anywhere feature for pen users, big improvements to the Paint app, native RAR and 7-zip file support, a new volume mixer, and much more. From a report: Windows Copilot is the headline feature for the Windows 11 23H2 update, bringing the same Bing Chat feature straight to the Windows 11 desktop. It appears as a sidebar in Windows 11, allowing you to control settings on a PC, launch apps, or simply answer queries. It&#x27;s integrated all over the operating system, too: Microsoft executives demoed using Copilot to write text messages using data from your calendar, navigation options in Outlook, and more. This is also Microsoft&#x27;s latest attempt to deliver a digital assistant inside Windows after the company shut down the Cortana app inside Windows 11 last month. 

It might be more successful this time, particularly as it&#x27;s powered by the same technologies behind Bing Chat, so you can ask real questions and get answers (that might not always be accurate) in return. [...] Microsoft is also adding native RAR and 7-zip support to Windows 11 with this update. That means you&#x27;ll be able to easily open files like tar, 7-zip, rar, gz, and many others using the libarchive open-source project that&#x27;s now built into Windows 11. Microsoft is also planning to provide support for creating these file formats in 2024.

                              <span>Rupert Murdoch is stepping down as chair of Fox and News Corp, after building a media empire over seven decades that revolutionized news and entertainment and made him one of the world&#x27;s most influential and controversial tycoons. WSJ: Murdoch, 92 years old, will exit his roles atop each company as of November, when they hold annual meetings, the companies said. He will be appointed chairman emeritus of each company. His eldest son, Lachlan Murdoch, who has served as co-chair of News Corp, will become sole chair of that company and will continue as Fox Corp executive chair and CEO. &quot;For my entire professional life, I have been engaged daily with news and ideas, and that will not change. But the time is right for me to take on different roles,&quot; Rupert Murdoch wrote in a memo to staff. 

His decision to step back solidifies Lachlan Murdoch as his successor. He called Lachlan a &quot;passionate, principled leader&quot; who can take the companies into the future. Murdoch is one of a handful of media barons, along with the likes of John Malone, Ted Turner and Sumner Redstone, who shaped the modern era of media. He has wielded influence in political and financial capitals, earning credit from his boosters and blame from his critics. Murdoch has remained active in his later years, pursuing big deals to reshape his companies. Murdoch is stepping back at an important moment for both wings of his media empire, as they confront fundamental challenges in the media landscape. Fox, a relatively small player in an entertainment industry now dominated by titans, is wrestling with the profound implications of cable cord-cutting and the growth of streaming. News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal, Times of London and other publications, is trying to find the right formula for digital growth amid a fierce battle for subscribers and online-ad dollars.

These revelations go back a decade, but remain of indisputable public interest:
 - The NSA listed Cavium, an American semiconductor company marketing Central Processing Units (CPUs) – the main processor in a computer which runs the operating system and applications -- as a successful example of a &quot;SIGINT-enabled&quot; CPU supplier.

                              <span>Waymo announced a &quot;tour across Los Angeles&quot; that allows curious residents the opportunity to ride in fully autonomous vehicles as the Alphabet-owned company begins to lay the groundwork for the launch of a commercial robotaxi service. The Verge reports: Waymo says it will make six multi-week &quot;tour stops&quot; in LA neighborhoods where people can hail a self-driving car without anyone in the front seat. Interested Angelenos can snag early access tickets at several pop-up events throughout the city or sign up for a waitlist. Once they receive a ticket, riders can use Waymo&#x27;s fully driverless vehicles for free within the service area for one week during the allotted time.
 
The tour is as follows: Santa Monica and Venice Beach October 11th-November 18th; Century City November 20th-December 17th; West Hollywood December 17th-January 7th; Mid City January 8th-23rd; Koreatown January 24th-February 8th; and Downtown LA February 9th-March 3rd. Waymo&#x27;s operational design domain -- the area in which its robotaxis are programmed to travel -- stretches from the West Side to Downtown LA, an area that&#x27;s larger than San Francisco but smaller than its coverage in Phoenix.

                              <span>SpaceX just extended its Falcon 9 rocket-reuse record. Space.com reports: The Falcon 9 lifted off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida on Tuesday at 11:38 p.m. EDT (0338 GMT Sept. 20), carrying 22 of SpaceX&#x27;s Starlink internet satellites toward low Earth orbit (LEO). The rocket&#x27;s first stage came back to Earth 8.5 minutes after launch, landing on a SpaceX drone ship stationed at sea. It was the 17th liftoff and landing for this Falcon 9&#x27;s first stage, according to a SpaceX mission description.
 
Those figures are unprecedented; the previous mark was 16, held by two different Falcon 9 boosters. The 22 Starlink satellites, meanwhile, deployed from the Falcon 9&#x27;s upper stage 62.5 minutes after launch as planned. Tuesday night&#x27;s liftoff extended another record as well: It was SpaceX&#x27;s 65th orbital mission of the year. The company&#x27;s previous mark, 61, was set in 2022. You can watch a recorded video of the launch here.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Verge: On the outskirts of the small town of Folschviller in eastern France stand three nondescript sheds. One of these temporary structures has recently become a hive of activity due to a continuous stream of visitors, including scientists, journalists, and the public. The shed sits above a borehole first drilled in 2006 and houses a gas measurement system called SysMoG, which was originally developed to determine the underground methane concentration. While the device did detect almost pure methane (99 percent) at a depth of 650 meters, probing further down, the borehole resulted in an unexpected and surprising discovery: hydrogen in high concentration. &quot;At 1,100 meters, the concentration of dissolved hydrogen is 14 percent. At 3,000 meters, t…</span>

                              <span>A few months after getting FDA approval for human trials, Neuralink is looking for its first test subjects. The Verge reports: The six-year initial trial, which the Elon Musk-owned company is calling &quot;the PRIME Study,&quot; is intended to test Neuralink tech designed to help those with paralysis control devices. The company is looking for people (PDF) with quadriplegia due to vertical spinal cord injury or ALS who are over the age of 22 and have a &quot;consistent and reliable caregiver&quot; to be part of the study.
 
The PRIME Study (which apparently stands for Precise Robotically Implanted Brain-Computer Interface, even though that acronym makes no sense) is set to research three things at once. The first is the N1 implant, Neuralink&#x27;s brain-computer device. The second is the R1 robot, the surgical robot that actually implants the device. The third is the N1 User App, the software that connects to the N1 and translates brain signals into computer actions. Neuralink says it&#x27;s planning to test both the safety and efficacy of all three parts of the system.
 
Those who participate in the PRIME Study will first participate in an 18-month study that involves nine visits with researchers. After that, they&#x27;ll spend at least two hours a week on brain-computer interface research sessions and then do 20 more visits over the next five years. Neuralink doesn&#x27;t say how many subjects it&#x27;s looking for or when it plans to begin the study but does say it only plans to compensate &quot;for study-related costs&quot; like travel to and from the study location. (Also not clear: where that location is. Neuralink only says it has received approval from &quot;our first hospital site.&quot;)

                              <span>Yesterday&#x27;s massive leaks from the Microsoft vs. FTC case have a large swath of the gaming world expecting that a more powerful, disc-free Xbox Series X refresh could be coming as soon as next year. But Xbox boss Phil Spencer is warning that players shouldn&#x27;t put too much stock in what he called &quot;old emails and documents.&quot; ArsTechnica adds: &quot;It is hard to see our team&#x27;s work shared in this way because so much has changed and there&#x27;s so much to be excited about right now, and in the future,&quot; Spencer wrote on social media late Tuesday. &quot;We will share the real plans when we are ready.&quot; Spencer followed up that post with a memo sent to the Xbox team, apologizing for the unintentional disclosure of internal plans. &quot;I know this is disappointing, even if many of the documents are well over a year old and our plans have evolved,&quot; the memo reads, in part. &quot;I also know we all take the confidentiality of our plans and our partners&#x27; information very seriously. This leak obviously is not us living up to that expectation... That said, there&#x27;s so much more to be excited about, and when we&#x27;re ready, we&#x27;ll share the real plans with our players.&quot; 

While Spencer&#x27;s statements are vague about who was responsible for the &quot;unintentional disclosure&quot; of Microsoft&#x27;s plans, a representative for the FTC was quick to push the blame on the company itself. &quot;The FTC was not responsible for uploading Microsoft&#x27;s plans for its games and consoles to the court website,&quot; FTC Director of the Office of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar wrote early Tuesday. In a follow-up post, Farrar pointed to a court order resealing the leaked information (too late for it to prevent the spread of the information, of course), which notes that &quot;Microsoft provided the link on September 14 and the Court uploaded the exhibits to [the] internet page established for this case.&quot; Further reading: Microsoft&#x27;s Phil Spencer Says Acquiring Nintendo Would Be &#x27;a Career Moment&#x27;

While the AI-generated selfie doesn&#x27;t appear to be deliberate misinformation, it highlights an inherent problem with the current state of generative AI and the internet: It is exceedingly easy to use AI tools to generate endless images, text, and audio with little more than a click of a button, and as this content floods every online platform, we, and the platforms we use to surface information, still don&#x27;t have a good way to identify and differentiate it from human-made content, manually or automatically.

                              <span>A sysadmin and his partner pleaded guilty this week to being part of a &quot;massive&quot; international ring that sold software licenses worth $88 million for &quot;significantly below the wholesale price.&quot; From a report: Brad and Dusti Pearce admitted one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and each face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. After agreeing to a plea deal, the Pearces must also forfeit at least $4 million as well as gold, silver, collectible coins, cryptocurrency, and a vehicle, and &quot;make full restitution to their victims,&quot; the US Department of Justice said. The pair from Tuttle, Oklahoma -- a city better known for its cattle ranchers and alfafa hay than pirated software -- were alleged to have sold pirated Avaya business telephone system software licenses. 

The licenses were then used to unlock features of the popular telephone system, which is used by thousands of companies around the globe. Dusti Pearce was said by prosecutors to have looked after the accounting side of the business, although only the wire fraud charge remains under the plea deal. Brad Pearce had previously worked as a customer service employee at Avaya, and was said to have used his admin privileges to &quot;generate tens of thousands of ADI software license keys&quot; that he sold to his main customer, Jason Hines, as well as &quot;other customers, who in turn sold them to resellers and end users around the globe,&quot; said the DoJ.

                              <span>Simon Hill, reporting for Wired: Every new hardware announcement is always described as &quot;the best ever,&quot; but Amazon&#x27;s new Eero Max 7 mesh might just be a real leap forward. This is Eero&#x27;s first tri-band mesh router that utilizes the latest Wi-Fi 7 standard, promising roughly double the speeds of its previous flagship system up to 4.3 Gigabits per second. Theoretically, you can download a 4K movie in 10 seconds. The router has a larger design than its predecessor, which allows for more antennas, cooling without the need for a fan, and space for four Ethernet ports. But all this comes at a hefty price -- a single Eero Max 7 costs a whopping $600. It&#x27;s early days for Wi-Fi 7, so as new models come out, we&#x27;ll see these prices dramatically drop. 

The Eero Max 7 supports the 2.4-GHz, 5-GHz, and 6-GHz bands and is fully backward compatible with all previous Wi-Fi versions; it runs the same TrueMesh software and app as other Eero systems, so it can be mixed and matched with any existing Eeros you have. However, you won&#x27;t be able to take advantage of those Wi-Fi 7 upgrades and speeds without a Wi-Fi 7-supported device, which there are very few of right now. A common criticism of Eero routers (and most mesh Wi-Fi systems) is the lack of Ethernet ports. The Eero Pro 6E only offered two ports rated at 2.5 Gbps and 1 Gbps. Despite the Eero Max 7&#x27;s larger size, it&#x27;s still recognizably an Eero finished in shiny white plastic, but it&#x27;s much larger than previous releases. That allows for four Ethernet ports, two rated at 10 Gbps and two at 2.5 Gbps. Accounting for packet overhead, tethered speeds max out at 9.4 Gbps.

                              <span>A trade group for U.S. authors has sued OpenAI in Manhattan federal court on behalf of prominent writers including John Grisham, Jonathan Franzen, George Saunders, Jodi Picault and &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; novelist George R.R. Martin, accusing the company of unlawfully training its popular artificial-intelligence based chatbot ChatGPT on their work. From a report: The proposed class-action lawsuit filed late on Tuesday by the Authors Guild joins several others from writers, source-code owners and visual artists against generative AI providers. In addition to Microsoft-backed OpenAI, similar lawsuits are pending against Meta Platforms and Stability AI over the data used to train their AI systems. Other authors involved in the latest lawsuit include &quot;The Lincoln Lawyer&quot; writer Michael Connelly and lawyer-novelists David Baldacci and Scott Turow.

                              <span>China accused the U.S. of infiltrating Huawei servers beginning in 2009, part of a broad-based effort to steal data that culminated in tens of thousands of cyber-attacks against Chinese targets last year. From a report: The Tailored Access Operations unit of the National Security Agency carried out the attacks in 2009, which then continuously monitored the servers, China&#x27;s Ministry of State Security said in a post on its official WeChat account on Wednesday. It didn&#x27;t provide details of attacks since 2009. Cyberattacks are a point of tension between Washington and Beijing, which has accused its political rival of orchestrating attacks against Chinese targets ever since Edward Snowden made explosive allegations about U.S. spying. Washington and cybersecurity researchers have said the Asian country has sponsored attacks against the West. 

The ministry&#x27;s accusations emerged as the two countries battle for technological supremacy. Huawei in particular has spurred alarm in Washington since the telecom leader unveiled a smartphone powered by an advanced chip it designed, which was made by Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. That&#x27;s in spite of years-long U.S. sanctions intended to cut Huawei off from the American technology it needs to design sophisticated chips and phones. The U.S. has been &quot;over-stretching&quot; the concept of national security with its clampdown on Chinese enterprises, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters at a regular press briefing in Beijing on Wednesday. &quot;What we want to tell the US is that suppression and containing of China will not stop China&#x27;s development. It will only make us more resolved in our development,&quot; Mao said.

                              <span>As equities soared in 2020 and consumers flocked to trading apps like Robinhood, Apple and Goldman Sachs were working on an investing feature that would let consumers buy and sell stocks, CNBC reported Wednesday, citing people familiar with the plans. From the report: The project was shelved last year as the markets turned south, said the sources, who asked not to be named because they weren&#x27;t authorized to speak on the matter. The effort, which has not been previously reported, would have added to Apple&#x27;s suite of financial products powered by Goldman. Apple first teamed up with the Wall Street bank to offer a credit card in 2019, and then added buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans and a high-yield savings account. The company said last month that the savings account offering had climbed past $10 billion in user deposits.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: A few lucky WhatsApp beta testers got a surprising treat this week: the company appears to be testing a version of its iOS app that is also optimized for the iPad. As first spotted by WABetaInfo, version 23.19.1.71 of WhatsApp&#x27;s TestFlight app includes the new iPad app as well. From what we can see in screenshots, the iPad app works exactly like you&#x27;d expect. You connect to it by scanning a QR code the same way you&#x27;d link your account to any other device. You&#x27;ll see a list of your conversations on the left and your current chat on the right. It&#x27;s pretty much the iOS app, but instead of seeing one pane at a time, you see both. It almost makes you wonder what took so long, especially when WhatsApp head Will Cathcart said all the way back in January of 2022 that &quot;we&#x27;d love to do it.&quot;

It didn&#x27;t elaborate on what it called a &quot;cybersecurity incident.&quot; Court spokesman Fadi El Abdallah said in a written statement that extra &quot;response and security measures are now ongoing&quot; with the assistance of authorities in the Netherlands, where the court is based. &quot;Looking forward, the Court will be building on existing work presently underway to strengthen its cyber security framework, including accelerating its use of cloud technology,&quot; his statement added. The court declined to go into any more detail about the incident, but said that as it &quot;continues to analyze and mitigate the impact of this incident, priority is also being given to ensuring that the core work of the Court continues.&quot;

                              <span>Steven Vaughan-Nichols writes via ZDNet: BILBAO, Spain: At the Open Source Summit Europe, Jonathan Corbet, Linux kernel developer and executive editor of Linux Weekly News, caught everyone up with what&#x27;s new in the Linux kernel and where it&#x27;s going from here. Here&#x27;s one major change coming down the road: Long-term support (LTS) for Linux kernels is being reduced from six to two years.
 
Currently, there are six LTS Linux kernels -- 6.1, 5.15, 5.10, 5.4, 4.19, and 4.14. Under the process to date, 4.14 would roll off in January 2024, and another kernel would be added. Going forward, though, when the 4.14 kernel and the next two drop off, they won&#x27;t be replaced. Why? Simple, Corbet explained: &quot;There&#x27;s really no point to maintaining it for that long because people are not using them.&quot; I agree. While I&#x27;m sure someone out there is still running 4.14 in a production Linux system, there can&#x27;t be many of them.
 
Another reason, and a far bigger problem than simply maintaining LTS, according to Corbet, is that Linux code maintainers are burning out. It&#x27;s not that developers are a problem. The last few Linux releases have involved an average of more than 2,000 programmers -- including about 200 new developers coming on board -- working on each release. However, the maintainers -- the people who check the code to see if it fits and works properly -- are another matter.

                              <span>After manufacturing crystals of an HIV drug in space, the first orbital factory is stuck in orbit after being denied reentry back to Earth due to safety concerns. Gizmodo reports: The U.S. Air Force denied a request from Varda Space Industries to land its in-space manufacturing capsule at a Utah training area, while the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) did not grant the company permission to reenter Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, leaving its spacecraft hanging as the company scrambles to find a solution, TechCrunch first reported. A spokesperson from the FAA told TechCrunch in an emailed statement that the company&#x27;s request was not granted at this time &quot;due to the overall safety, risk and impact analysis.&quot;
 
Gizmodo reached out to Varda Space to ask which regulatory requirements have not been met, but the company responded with a two-word email that ominously read, &quot;no comment.&quot; The California-startup did provide an update on its spacecraft through X (formerly Twitter). &quot;We&#x27;re pleased to report that our spacecraft is healthy across all systems. It was originally designed for a full year on orbit if needed,&quot; Varda Space wrote on X. &quot;We look forward to continuing to collaborate w/ our gov partners to bring our capsule back to Earth as soon as possible.&quot; Varda Space Industries launched its first test mission on June 12, &quot;successfully sending a 200-pound (90-kilogram) capsule designed to carry drug research into Earth&#x27;s orbit,&quot; reported CNN. &quot;The experiment, conducted in microgravity by simple onboard machines, aims to test whether it would be possible to manufacture pharmaceuticals in space remotely.&quot;

This resulted in the reconstruction of skin and skeletal muscle transcriptomes from an extinct species for the first time. The researchers note that their findings have relevant implications for international efforts to resurrect extinct species, including both the Tasmanian tiger and the wooly mammoth, as well as for studying pandemic RNA viruses. The findings have been published in the journal Genome Research.

                              <span>The infrastructure behind popular AI workloads is so demanding that Schneider Electric has suggested it may be time to reevaluate the way we build datacenters. The Register reports: In a recent white paper [PDF], the French multinational broke down several of the factors that make accommodating AI workloads so challenging and offered its guidance for how future datacenters could be optimized for them. The bad news is some of the recommendations may not make sense for existing facilities. The problem boils down to the fact that AI workloads often require low-latency, high-bandwidth networking to operate efficiently, which forces densification of racks, and ultimately puts pressure on existing datacenters&#x27; power delivery and thermal management systems.

                              <span>Google announced today that it is opening access to more contributors to participate in Road Mapper, a tool where you can add missing roads to Google Maps in areas of the world that need it most. TechCrunch reports: Road Mapper is an invite-only platform where people participate in challenges, drawing roads located in areas with a large population, yet have a significant amount of road network missing from Google Maps. Users draw road geometry using satellite images. The drawings then go through a review process and, if accepted, will be live on Google Maps in a few days. Those interested in joining Road Mapper can fill out Google&#x27;s online form. Plus, top contributors that have mapped the most roads can now refer up to five contributors via the Road Mapper Referral form. Google&#x27;s blog post notes that its contributors have mapped more than 1.5 million kilometers of roads, enabling more than 200 million people to navigate with Google Maps. That&#x27;s pretty impressive considering Road Mapper only launched two years ago.

Although the company is famous for pioneering lean methods of manufacturing and being an early pioneer of hybrid electric powertrains, the switch to battery electric vehicles caught it somewhat unprepared. As rivals locked up contracts for critical minerals and formed joint ventures with battery makers (or built their own), Toyota has appeared to fall behind. Now, it has released a new roadmap showing how it will regain competitiveness and sell 3.5 million EVs by 2030. After some early experiments with electric-converted RAV4s (including a partnership with Tesla), Toyota has finally released a modern BEV, the bZ4x.

                              <span>When we announced Hotwire a few years back, it was always meant as a triptych. The center piece is Turbo. That&#x27;s the drop-in level-up that makes multi-page web apps feel like single-page web apps – without giving up any of the development advantages to server-side programming. Then Stimulus brought order and structure to JavaScript sprinkles by triggering custom behavior via HTML attributes. And finally, which is what we&#x27;re revealing today, there&#x27;s Strada: The bridge between native controls and the web app.
Strada continues the Majestic Monolith story by extending Hotwire onto native controls. Where Turbo Native makes it easy to have native mobile apps driven by fast web views, Strada brings that extra bit of polish only native controls, like native menus, can provide.

                              <span>Google Bard is getting support for Extensions today, incorporating essential apps like Google Maps, YouTube, Hotels, and Flights to simplify data retrieval and accelerate the creative process. Android Police reports: This integration ensures that users can seamlessly amalgamate data from myriad sources, thereby accelerating your creative process or just making it easier to accomplish basic tasks across the board. These tools were originally teased at I/O before their wider release today. The company posted an excellent explainer of how this works on its YouTube channel.
 
With today&#x27;s update, you can now sync Bard with your Gmail, Docs, and Drive. This capability ensures that the AI collaborates with your personal content, making data retrieval and summarization more fluid. With the enhancement of the Google It button, Bard&#x27;s responses can be cross-checked with Google Search, instilling greater trust in AI-generated data. Additionally, conversations initiated by others via Bard can be continued in your account, emphasizing collaborative creativity. You can learn more about Google Bard Extensions here.

                              <span>Microsoft is planning to refresh its Xbox Series X console in 2024 with an all-new design and features. The Verge reports: Codenamed Brooklin, the unannounced console refresh has been accidentally revealed in new FTC v. Microsoft documents this week. The new Xbox Series X design looks a lot more cylindrical than the existing console and will ship without a disc drive. Internal confidential Microsoft documents reveal it has 2TB of storage (up from 1TB), a USB-C front port with power delivery, and an &quot;all-new, more immersive controller.&quot;
 
The new controller, codenamed Sebile, is set to be announced early next year for $69.99 and will include an accelerometer which should let you merely lift it to wake the gamepad. It has a two-tone color scheme and will support a direct connection to cloud, Bluetooth 5.2, and a presumably updated âoeXbox Wireless 2â connection. Microsoft also lists &quot;precision haptic feedback&quot; and &quot;VCA haptics double as speakers&quot; as specs for the controller. It will also have quieter buttons and thumbsticks, a rechargeable and swappable battery, and modular thumbsticks.
 
Inside the new Xbox Series X design, Microsoft is also adding Wi-Fi 6E support, a Bluetooth 5.2 radio, and the company is shrinking the existing die to 6nm &quot;for improve efficiency.&quot; The PSU power will be reduced by 15 percent, according to Microsoft&#x27;s document. Microsoft is targeting the same $499 launch price of the Xbox Series X. Microsoft lists a roadmap for this new Xbox Series X console and controller, alongside a refreshed Xbox Series S with 1TB of storage. Microsoft just launched a refreshed Xbox Series S in black, but there could be another refresh on the way in 2024 with Wi-Fi 6E support and Bluetooth 5.2. It will also include this new Xbox controller. [...] Microsoft is tentatively planning to launch this new Xbox Series S refresh next September, with the Xbox Series X refresh in November.

                              <span>The majority of U.S. adults don&#x27;t believe the benefits of artificial intelligence outweigh the risks, according to a new Mitre-Harris Poll released Tuesday. From a report: 54% of the 2,063 adults in a Mitre-Harris Poll survey in July said they were more concerned about the risks of AI than they were excited about the potential benefits. At the same time, 39% of adults said they believed today&#x27;s AI technologies are safe and secure -- down 9 points from the previous survey in November 2022. AI operators and the tech industry are eyeing new regulations and policy changes to secure their models and mitigate the security and privacy risks associated with them. 

The new survey data is some of the first to highlight the growing support for these regulatory efforts. &quot;While the public has started to benefit from new AI capabilities such as ChatGPT, we&#x27;ve all watched as chatbots have spread political disinformation and shared dangerous medical advice,&quot; said Douglas Robbins, vice president of engineering and prototyping at the nonprofit security research and development firm Mitre, in a statement. &quot;Strengthening existing government regulation and increasing public and private investments in AI assurance can play a critical role in addressing these concerns,&quot; he added.

                              <span>Researchers have discovered a never-before-seen backdoor for Linux that&#x27;s being used by a threat actor linked to the Chinese government. From a report: The new backdoor originates from a Windows backdoor named Trochilus, which was first seen in 2015 by researchers from Arbor Networks, now known as Netscout. They said that Trochilus executed and ran only in memory, and the final payload never appeared on disks in most cases. That made the malware difficult to detect. Researchers from NHS Digital in the UK have said Trochilus was developed by APT10, an advanced persistent threat group linked to the Chinese government that also goes by the names Stone Panda and MenuPass. 

Other groups eventually used it, and its source code has been available on GitHub for more than six years. Trochilus has …</span>

                              <span>The sea-ice surrounding Antarctica is well below any previous recorded winter level, satellite data shows, a worrying new benchmark for a region that once seemed resistant to global warming. BBC: &quot;It&#x27;s so far outside anything we&#x27;ve seen, it&#x27;s almost mind-blowing,&quot; says Walter Meier, who monitors sea-ice with the National Snow and Ice Data Center. An unstable Antarctica could have far-reaching consequences, polar experts warn. Antarctica&#x27;s huge ice expanse regulates the planet&#x27;s temperature, as the white surface reflects the Sun&#x27;s energy back into the atmosphere and also cools the water beneath and near it. 

Without its ice cooling the planet, Antarctica could transform from Earth&#x27;s refrigerator to a radiator, experts say. The ice that floats on the Antarctic Ocean&#x27;s surface now measures less than 17 million sq km - that is 1.5 million sq km of sea-ice less than the September average, and well below previous winter record lows. That&#x27;s an area of missing ice about five times the size of the British Isles. Dr Meier is not optimistic that the sea-ice will recover to a significant degree. 

Scientists are still trying to identify all the factors that led to this year&#x27;s low sea-ice - but studying trends in Antarctica has historically been challenging. In a year when several global heat and ocean temperature records have broken, some scientists insist the low sea-ice is the measure to pay attention to. &quot;We can see how much more vulnerable it is,&quot; says Dr Robbie Mallett, of the University of Manitoba, who is based on the Antarctic peninsula. Already braving isolation, extreme cold and powerful winds, this year&#x27;s thin sea-ice has made his team&#x27;s work even more difficult. &quot;There is a risk that it breaks off and drifts out to sea with us on it,&quot; Dr Mallett says.

                              <span>U.S. News &amp; World Report&#x27;s 2024 college rankings features many of the usual prestigious institutions at the top of the list, but also vaults some schools much higher after the publisher revised its grading system to reward different criteria. From a report: U.S News&#x27; ranking algorithm now based more than 50% of an institution&#x27;s score on what it describes as &quot;success in enrolling and graduating students from all backgrounds with manageable debt and post-graduate success.&quot; The system also places greater emphasis on &quot;social mobility,&quot; which generally refers to an individual making gains in education, income and other markers of socioeconomic status. Overall, more than a dozen public universities shot up 50 spots on the annual list of the U.S.&#x27; best colleges, while several elite private schools largely held their ground, the new report shows. 

&quot;The significant changes in this year&#x27;s methodology are part of the ongoing evolution to make sure our rankings capture what is most important for students as they compare colleges and select the school that is right for them,&quot; U.S. News CEO Eric Gertler said in a statement. The change comes after a chorus of critics complained that the publication&#x27;s rankings reinforce elitism and do little to help students find schools that suit their academic needs and financial circumstances. A growing number of schools, including elite institutions such as Columbia University and the Harvard and Yale law schools, also have stopped participating in the ranking and publicly criticized U.S. News&#x27; methodology.

                              <span>Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said she was &quot;upset&quot; when China&#x27;s Huawei released a new phone with an advanced chip during her visit to the country last month but noted that the US has no evidence China can make those components &quot;at scale.&quot; From a report: &quot;We are trying to use every single tool at our disposal to deny the Chinese the ability to advance their technology in ways that can hurt us,&quot; Raimondo testified at a congressional hearing Tuesday. The Commerce Department&#x27;s Bureau of Industry and Security this month opened an investigation into Huawei&#x27;s phone and the &quot;purported&quot; 7-nanometer chip, made by China&#x27;s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, which was discovered in a teardown of the handset that TechInsights conducted for Bloomberg News. It is unclear whether SMIC has approval from Commerce to supply Huawei, which has been blacklisted by the US. Raimondo said she won&#x27;t comment on any active investigations, but that the Commerce Department will investigate every time it appears a company may have violated US export controls.

                              <span>Intel Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger, plotting a comeback for the once-dominant chipmaker, made the case that the company&#x27;s technology will be vital to an industrywide boom in artificial intelligence computing. From a report: Speaking at Intel&#x27;s annual Innovation conference, Gelsinger pointed to advances that his company is making in production technology and software developer tools for AI. The opportunity will only grow as more artificial intelligence capabilities are powered by personal computers, he said. &quot;AI represents a generational shift, giving rise to a new era of global expansion where computing is even more foundational to a better future for all,&quot; Gelsinger said. 

&quot;For developers, this creates massive societal and business opportunities to push the boundaries of what&#x27;s possible, to create solutions to the world&#x27;s biggest challenges.&quot; Gelsinger is trying to fire up interest in Intel&#x27;s technology and return to an era when its annual conferences offered a road map for the whole computing industry. He argues that artificial intelligence use won&#x27;t be confined to the data centers of giant cloud providers, which rely heavily on chips from Nvidia. Instead, it will fan out into new areas, including the now-moribund PC market.

                              <span>The Department of Homeland Security wants Congress and other federal agencies to help it streamline 52 different cyber reporting requirements to protect critical infrastructure and ease regulatory burdens on hacking victims. On Tuesday, it released a 107-page report that it hopes will serve as a road map to smooth that process. From a report: More than 30 federal agencies and departments, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Comptroller of the Currency and US Secret Service, have met since June 2022 to hammer out how to reduce regulatory overlap as the federal government grapples with the messy state of cyber reporting rules. They are among members of the Cybersecurity Incident Reporting Council, which was set up as part of a new cyber reporting law passed last year and developed the report recommendations. 

&quot;Everybody is desperate for some harmonization and standardization here,&quot; Robert Silvers, DHS&#x27;s under secretary for strategy, policy and plans who chairs the council, told Bloomberg News in an interview. &quot;This is a first-of-its-kind effort.&quot; Federal agencies know well that cyber reporting requirements have become &quot;too much of a patchwork,&quot; Silvers added. There are already 45 existing reporting requirements administered by 22 federal agencies, spanning national and economic security concerns to consumer and privacy protections, according to the report. Seven more requirements are expected, including the reporting law that created the council, and a further five are under consideration, according to the report.

                              <span>Intel has taken the wraps off its forthcoming next-gen Meteor Lake processors following its successful 12th (Alder Lake) and 13th Gen (Raptor Lake) processors with its new E- and P-core design. WindowsCentral: Its first chip built on the Intel 4 process node with Foveros 3D packaging, Intel calls Meteor Lake its &quot;biggest architectural shift in 40 years&quot; and that it will &quot;lay the foundation for innovations for the PC,&quot; as noted by Tim Wilson, VP, Design and Engineering Group and GM, SoC Design at Intel. Meteor Lake is Intel&#x27;s next-gen CPU and the first built on the Intel 4 process, which is part of Intel&#x27;s long-term goal of &quot;5 nodes in 4 years.&quot; Previous generation naming would suggest it would be called Intel 14th Gen, but Intel is moving away from its older naming schema. Some reports have suggested Meteor Lake may reflect a reboot in generation numbers. Current rumors suggest Intel 14th Gen is simply a refresh of Raptor Lake, although Meteor Lake may play a part in that for laptops. 

Meteor Lake processors are expected to ship in late 2023 or early 2024 in new laptops with thinner and lighter designs, better cooling, and much better battery life. The significant change for Meteor Lake is what Intel calls disaggregation, which means the breaking down of core components into separate &#x27;tiles&#x27; on the SoC. Meteor Lake features four Tiles, including:
Compute Tile: New E-core and P-core microarchitecture, built on Intel 4 process technology
SoC Tile: Low power island E-cores, NPU, Wi-Fi 6E/7, native HDMI 2.1 and 8K HDR AV1 support
Graphics Tile: Integrated Intel Arc architecture
IO Tile: Thunderbolt 4 (and presumably Thunderbolt 5) and PCIe Gen5

                              <span>European governments have &quot;systematically&quot; shrunk their railways and starved them of funding while pouring money into expanding their road network, a report has found. The Guardian: The length of motorways in Europe grew 60% between 1995 and 2020 while railways shrank 6.5%, according to research from the German thinktanks Wuppertal Institute and T3 Transportation. For every $1 governments spent building railways, they spent $1.7 building roads. &quot;This is a political choice,&quot; said Lorelei Limousin, a climate campaigner with Greenpeace, which commissioned the report. &quot;We see the consequences today with the climate, but also with people who have been left without an alternative solution to cars.&quot; 

The report found the EU, Norway, Switzerland and the UK spent $1.6tn between 1995 and 2018 to extend their roads -- but just $0.99tn to extend their rail networks. In the four years that followed (2018-21), the average gap in investment in rail and road decreased from 66% to 34%. During that time, seven countries invested more in rail than roads -- Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Luxembourg and the UK -- while the rest spent more on roads than rail.

                              <span>The documents in the FTC v. Microsoft case also reveal Microsoft&#x27;s far future plans for 2028 -- by which the company believed it could achieve &quot;full convergence&quot; of its cloud gaming platform and physical hardware to deliver &quot;cloud hybrid games.&quot; From a report: &quot;Our vision: develop a next generation hybrid game platform capable of leveraging the combined power of the client and cloud to deliver deeper immersion and entirely new classes of game experiences.&quot; Those are the words on just one slide from a leaked presentation dubbed &quot;The Next Generation of Gaming at Microsoft,&quot; which appears to be a May 2022 pitch document entirely around this idea. The company imagined you playing these games using the combined power of a sub-$99 gadget -- possibly a handheld -- and its xCloud platform simultaneously.

                              <span>YouTuber Pitstoptech built a &quot;fully upgradeable gaming handheld&quot; around one of Framework&#x27;s upgradable motherboards. Tom&#x27;s Hardware reports: The handheld model you see in the video is equipped with the following components:
 
- Framework&#x27;s Intel Core i7-1260P processor equipped mainboard
- 7-inch FHD touchscreen display
- 16 GB RAM
- 512 GB SSD
- Dual front-facing speakers
- Detachable controllers
- 55 Wh Battery
- High-speed Wi-Fi &amp; Bluetooth
 
These components appear to offer some passable small-screen gaming. And in the video, you can see the device plugs into a larger monitor / TV where using the controllers in a detached configuration (Bluetooth) may be more comfortable. [...] Pitstoptech intends to prepare and sell handheld DIY kits &quot;soon,&quot; based on the prototype design you see in the pictures / video.

                              <span>David Heinemeier Hansson, CTO of SaaS project management outfit 37Signals, has posted an update on the cloud repatriation project he&#x27;s led, writing that it&#x27;s already saved the company $1 million. The Register: Hansson has previously revealed that his company spent $3.2 million a year on cloud computing, most of it at Amazon Web Services. His repatriation plan called for the company to spend $600,000 on eight meaty servers that each pack 256 virtual CPUs, and have them hosted at an outfit called Deft. That plan was projected to save $7 million over five years. In his Saturday post, Hansson wrote he now thinks he can find $10 million of savings in the same period. 

&quot;Our cloud spend is down by 60 percent already... from around $180,000/month to less than $80,000,&quot; he wrote, qualifying that the number excludes the cost of Amazon Web Services&#x27;s Simple Storage Service. &quot;That&#x27;s a cool million dollars in savings at the yearly run rate, and we have another big drop coming in September, before the remaining spend will petter out through the rest of the year,&quot; he added. The CTO revealed that the 37 Signals ops team remains the same size even though it now tends its own hardware, which cost &quot;about half a million dollars.&quot;

                              <span>I count my lucky stars that SUSE&#x27;s pricing for Rancher and Harvester was so ridiculous over the top for our situation. If they hadn&#x27;t reached for those million-dollar contracts, we&#x27;d probably be stuck in enterprise vendor hell forever, buying over-priced consulting services for Kubernetes and VM tooling. That would have sucked.
Now that might sound sarcastic, but I&#x27;m being earnest here. So many of the best opportunities in life only reveal themselves when the easy path is blocked. We are creatures in search of the least resistance, so to reach higher, we usually need a little push. That dance with the enterprisey sales people at SUSE was such a push for our cloud exit adventure at 37signals.

                              <span>Under an agreement announced Monday, Joby Aviation will build hundreds of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft in the same Ohio river valley where the Wright brothers pioneered human flight. The Associated Press reports: Joby&#x27;s decision to locate its first scaled manufacturing facility at a 140-acre (57-hectare) site at Dayton International Airport delivers on two decades of groundwork laid by the state&#x27;s leaders, Republican Lt. Gov. Jon Husted said. Importantly, the site is near Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and the headquarters of the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratories. The Wright brothers, Orville and Wilbur, lived and worked in Dayton. In 1910, they opened the first U.S. airplane factory there. To connect the historical dots, Joby&#x27;s formal announcement Monday took place at Orville Wright&#x27;s home, Hawthorn Hill, and concluded with a ceremonial flypast of a replica of the Wright Model B Flyer.
 
Joby&#x27;s production aircraft is designed to transport a pilot and four passengers at speeds of up to 200 miles (321.87 kilometers) per hour, with a maximum range of 100 miles (160.93 kilometers). Its quiet noise profile is barely audible against the backdrop of most cities, the company said. The plan is to place them in aerial ridesharing networks beginning in 2025. The $500 million project is supported by up to $325 million in incentives from the state of Ohio, its JobsOhio economic development office and local government. With the funds, Joby plans to build an Ohio facility capable of delivering up to 500 aircraft a year and creating 2,000 jobs. The U.S. Department of Energy has invited Joby to apply for a loan to support development of the facility as a clean energy project.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Reuters: The U.S. Justice Department on Monday objected to removing the public from the court during some discussions of how Google prices online advertising, one of the issues at the heart of the antitrust trial under way in Washington. The government is seeking to show that Alphabet&#x27;s Google broke antitrust law to maintain its dominance in online search. The search dominance led to fast-increasing advertising revenues that made Google a $1 trillion company. [Throughout the trial, Google&#x27;s defense is that its high market share reflects the quality of its product rather than any illegal actions to build monopolies in some aspects of its business.]
 
David Dahlquist, speaking for the government, pointed to a document that was redacted that had a short back and forth about Google&#x27;s pricing for search advertising. Dahlquist then argued to Judge Amit Mehta, who will decide the case, that information like the tidbit in the document should not be redacted. &quot;This satisfies public interest because it&#x27;s at the core of the DOJ case against Google,&quot; he said. Speaking for Google, John Schmidtlein urged that all discussions of pricing be in a closed session, which means the public and reporters must leave the courtroom. [...]
 
Case in point was testimony given early Monday by a Verizon executive, Brian Higgins, about the company&#x27;s decision to always pre-install Google&#x27;s Chrome browser with Google search on its mobile phones. After about 30 minutes of testimony, Higgins&#x27; testimony was closed for the next two hours. It&#x27;s possible that he was asked about Google&#x27;s payments to Verizon but the public will never know. Those payments -- which the government said are $10 billion annually to mobile carriers and others -- helped the California-based tech giant win powerful default positions on smartphones and elsewhere.

The Verge reports: In a ruling (PDF) issued today, Judge Beth Freeman granted a preliminary injunction for tech industry group NetChoice, saying the law likely violates the First Amendment. It&#x27;s the latest of several state-level internet regulations to be blocked while a lawsuit against them proceeds, including some that are likely bound for the Supreme Court. The CAADCA is meant to expand on existing laws -- like the federal COPPA framework -- that govern how sites can collect data from children. But Judge Freeman objected to several of its provisions, saying they would unlawfully target legal speech. &quot;Although the s…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from CNN: A cyberattack at Clorox is causing wide-scale disruption of the company&#x27;s operations, hampering its ability to make its cleaning materials, Clorox said Monday. Clorox said some of its products are now in short supply as it has struggled to meet consumer demand during the disruption. Clorox didn&#x27;t specify which of its products are affected.
 
The company on Monday revealed in a regulatory filing that it detected unauthorized activity in some of its information technology systems in August. Clorox said it immediately took action to stop the attack, including reducing its operations. It now believes the attack has been contained. Still, Clorox has not been able to get its manufacturing operations back up to full speed. The company said it is fulfilling and processing orders manually. The company doesn&#x27;t expect to begin the process of returning to normal operations until next week.
 
&quot;Clorox has already resumed production at the vast majority of its manufacturing sites and expects the ramp up to full production to occur over time,&quot; the company said. &quot;At this time, the company cannot estimate how long it will take to resume fully normalized operations.&quot; The company said the cyberattack and the delays will hurt its current-quarter financial results materially, although Clorox said determining any longer-term impact would be premature, &quot;given the ongoing recovery.&quot;

From a report: Google announced in July that the service was getting shut down and that it had struck a deal with Squarespace to sell off the existing customer base. Part of that transition process means winding down the existing Google Domains functionality. 9to5Google was the first site to notice that you can no longer buy a domain through the service while it waits for the Google Grim Reaper to arrive. Google Domain&#x27;s homepage has a notice explaining that this all apparently went down a few days ago, saying, &quot;On September 7, 2023 Squarespace acquired all domain registrations and related customer accounts from Google Domains. Customers and domains will be transitioned over the next few months.&quot; You can still manage existing domains on Google Domains, but that&#x27;s it.

                              <span>Windows blog: Today we are beginning to roll out an update for the Paint app to Windows Insiders in the Canary and Dev Channels (version 11.2308.18.0 or higher). With this update, we are introducing support for layers and transparency! You can now add, remove, and manage layers on the canvas to create richer and more complex digital art. With layers, you can stack shapes, text, and other image elements on top of each other. To get started, click on the new Layers button in the toolbar, which will open a panel on the side of the canvas. This is where you can add new layers to the canvas. Try changing the order of layers in this panel to see how the order of stacked image elements on the canvas changes. You can also show or hide and duplicate individual layers or merge layers together. 

We are adding support for transparency as well, including the ability to open and save transparent PNGs! When working with a single layer, you will notice a checkerboard pattern on the canvas indicating the portions of the image that are transparent. Erasing any content from the canvas now truly erases the content instead of painting the area white. When working with multiple layers, if you erase content on one layer, you will reveal the content in layers underneath.

                              <span>Video-game tool maker Unity Software said Monday it&#x27;s backtracking on major aspects of a controversial new price hike, telling staff in an all-hands meeting that it&#x27;s now considering changes including a cap on potential fees. From a report: Unity, which operates and licenses a suite of video-game development tools called the Unity Engine, set off a firestorm last week when it announced plans to charge customers for every new installation of their game after a certain threshold. The decision triggered widespread protests, leading several video-game makers to say they would boycott Unity until the policy is changed. Under the tentative new plan, Unity will limit fees to 4% of a game&#x27;s revenue for customers making over $1 million and said that installations counted toward reaching the threshold won&#x27;t be retroactive, according to recording of the meeting reviewed by Bloomberg. Last week, Chief Executive Officer John Riccitiello delayed an all-hands meeting on the pricing changes and closed two offices after the company received what it said was a credible death threat.

From the report: Panos Panay, who led Microsoft&#x27;s Windows team and was central to the company&#x27;s hardware push with its Surface computers, said he was leaving Microsoft earlier Monday. Dave Limp, the longtime Amazon hardware chief, said last month that he would retire from the company before the end of the year.

                              <span>Apple on Monday rolled out iOS 17, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17, HomePod 17 and watchOS 10, the latest operating system versions for all its devices minus the Mac lineup. iOS 17: iOS 17 expands on last year&#x27;s Lock Screen updates with the addition of interactive widgets and StandBy, a new feature that turns the iPhone into a mini home hub when it is charging. You can now see voicemail transcriptions in real time, and leave video messages in FaceTime. FaceTime also now works on the Apple TV with tvOS 17. With NameDrop, exchanging contacts is as simple as touching two phones together, and Messages has been overhauled with new safety features and updates to the way that stickers work. Autocorrect is better than ever, Spotlight search has been improved, private browsing in Safari is more secure with Face ID lock, and there&#x27;s now a mood tracking feature in the Health app. Passwords can be shared in iCloud Keychain and AirTags can be shared among family members too, plus there are new features for the AirPods Pro. Apple has also added updates to Siri, Mail, Reminders, Notes, Home, and more. tvOS 17: In tvOS 17, Apple has added a FaceTime app for FaceTime calls on a larger screen. The feature works through an iPhone or iPad running iOS 17/iPadOS 17, with the iOS device serving as the camera and the TV serving as the display. With a Split View option, you can place your FaceTime call on one side of the TV and a TV show or game on the other side for SharePlay experiences. [...] Other new features include Dolby Vision 8.1 support, an enhance dialogue option to make it easier to hear what&#x27;s being said over music and effects, and support for third-party VPN apps.

                              <span>Elad Gil, writing in a blog post: In most industries, regulation prevents competition. This famous chart of prices over time reflects how highly regulated industries (healthcare, education, energy) have their costs driven up over time, while less regulated industries (clothing, software, toys) drop costs dramatically over time. (Please note I do not believe these are inflation adjusted - so 60-70% may be &quot;break even&quot; pricing inflation adjusted.) 

Regulation favors incumbents in two ways. First, it increase the cost of entering a market, in some cases dramatically. The high cost of clinical trials and the extra hurdles put in place to launch a drug are good examples of this. A must-watch video is this one with Paul Janssen, one of the giants of pharma, in which he states that the vast majority of drug development budgets are wasted on tests imposed by regulators which &quot;has little to do with actual research or actual development.&quot; This is a partial explanation for why (outside of Moderna, an accident of COVID), no $40B+ market cap new biopharma company has been launched in almost 40 years (despite healthcare being 20% of US GDP). 

Secondly, regulation favors incumbents via something known as &quot;regulatory capture.&quot; In regulatory capture, the regulators become beholden to a specific industry lobby or group -- for example by receiving jobs in the industry after working as a regulator, or via specific forms of lobbying. There becomes a strong incentive to &quot;play nice&quot; with the incumbents by regulators and to bias regulations their way, in order to get favors later in life.

                              <span>Microsoft AI researchers accidentally exposed tens of terabytes of sensitive data, including private keys and passwords, while publishing a storage bucket of open source training data on GitHub. From a report: In research shared with TechCrunch, cloud security startup Wiz said it discovered a GitHub repository belonging to Microsoft&#x27;s AI research division as part of its ongoing work into the accidental exposure of cloud-hosted data. Readers of the GitHub repository, which provided open source code and AI models for image recognition, were instructed to download the models from an Azure Storage URL. However, Wiz found that this URL was configured to grant permissions on the entire storage account, exposing additional private data by mistake. This data included 38 terabytes of sensitive information, including the personal backups of two Microsoft employees&#x27; personal computers. The data also contained other sensitive personal data, including passwords to Microsoft services, secret keys and more than 30,000 internal Microsoft Teams messages from hundreds of Microsoft employees.

                              <span>Today Wired published an opinion piece by software engineer Zeb Larson headlined &quot;ChatGPT Isn&#x27;t Coming for Your Coding Job.&quot;

Firing engineers and throwing AI at blocked feature development would probably result in disaster, followed by the rehiring of those engineers in short order. 

More reasonable suggestions show that large language models (LLMs) can replace some of the duller work of engineering. They can offer autocomplete suggestions or methods to sort data, if they&#x27;re prompted correctly. As an engineer, I can imagine using an LLM to &quot;rubber duck&quot; a problem, giving it prompts for potential solutions that I can review. It wouldn&#x27;t replace conferring with another engineer, because LLMs still don&#x27;t understand the actual requirements of a feature or the interconnections within a code base, but it would speed up those conversations by getting rid of the busy work... 

 [C]omputing history has already demonstrated that attempts to reduce the presence of developers or streamline their role only end up adding complexity to the work and making those workers even more necessary. If anything, ChatGPT stands to eliminate the duller work of coding much the same way that compilers ended the drudgery of having to work in binary, which would make it easier for developers to focus more on building out the actual architecture of their creations... We&#x27;ve introduced more and more complexity to computers in the hopes of making them so simple that they don&#x27;t need to be programmed at all. Unsurprisingly, throwing complexity at complexity has only made it worse, and we&#x27;re no closer to letting managers cut out the software engineers.

Together they penned a warning about a future filled with robotaxis. &quot;Their convenience could seduce us into vastly overusing our cars. The result? An artificial-intelligence-powered nightmare of traffic, technically perfect but awful for our cities.&quot;

Why do we believe this? Because it has already come to pass with ride-sharing. In the 2010s, the Senseable City Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where one of us serves as the director, was at the forefront of using Big Data to study how ride-hailing and ride…</span>

                              <span>&quot;Chaos and Concern in Sin City,&quot; read this morning&#x27;s headline on a video report from ABC News about &quot;the massive cyberattack in Las Vegas crippling several hotels and casinos, and putting a damper on getaways for thousands of tourists there.&quot;

&quot;Today marks a week since that cyberattack hit Las Vegas, and MGM hotels and casinos are still working on getting systems back up and running.. The online reservation site for MGM is still down, ATMs not working, and those playing the slot machines or even video poker having to wait for attendants to pay them out in cash. All of this fiasco leading to long lines at check-in, and now a cyber investigation with the FBI... 

Other gaming resorts also having issues. Caesar&#x27;s entertainment says they too were a victim of a cyberattack, but their online operations were not impacted. Then this weekend at the Venetian, an outage shutting down some slots, but the resort says they&#x27;re back up, and that at least thankfully was not due to a cyber attack. 
They report MGM properties were affected as far away as Atlantic City, New Jersey.

                              <span>On August 30th a scientific paper discussed lithium in an extinct volcano in the western United States. But would it also increase supplies of a crucial battery-making ingredient? 

&quot;The mining industry is seldom that simple,&quot; argues Bloomberg&#x27;s Energy Digest newsletter:

The discovery of new deposits — be it the giant Simandou iron ore mine in Guinea or diamonds in Canada&#x27;s Northwest Territories — rarely turns an industry on its head, and certainly not quickly. For lithium, that&#x27;s likely to be especially true. Unlike cobalt and nickel, lithium isn&#x27;t geologically scarce when it comes to economically viable deposits. And while there are short-term bottlenecks as the mining world reacts to a sudden spike in demand, few see long-term shortages. In fact, the supply outlook is so compelling that all but one of the biggest miners — Rio Tinto Group, which accidentally stumbled across a big deposit — decided it&#x27;s not an industry they want to be in. 

Instead, much of the focus is on processing and refining the element into a grade suitable for batteries. &quot;The news is a reminder that lithium isn&#x27;t rare, but producing battery-grade quantities at scale is the true challenge,&quot; said Chris Berry, president of House Mountain Partners, an industry consultant.

                              <span>The VR blog Nifty Sparks made an interesting discovery:
In a strategic move that could reshape the gaming industry, Epic Games, the creator of the widely-used Unreal Engine, is reportedly considering native integration with Apple&#x27;s forthcoming Vision Pro. 

The mixed-reality headset, slated for a 2024 release, could greatly benefit from this integration, but the timing of this development is particularly noteworthy, as it comes amidst ongoing legal disputes between Apple and Epic Games and a recent controversy surrounding changes to Unity&#x27;s pricing structure. 
Victor Lerp, Unreal Engine XR Product Specialist at Epic Games, has indicated that the company is actively exploring native support for Apple Vision Pro.
 

In Unreal Engine&#x27;s developer forums, Lerp turned up in a thread titled &quot;Support for Apple Vision Pro in Unreal ??&quot; Someone had posted &quot;Please tell me there is support coming?&quot; and in June Lerp had first responded &quot;We don&#x27;t have any information to share at the moment, but stay tuned for the future.&quot; 

But four days ago, Lerp returned to the thread with an update. &quot;Internally we&#x27;re exploring native Unreal Engine support for Apple Vision Pro, but it&#x27;s too early for us to share details on the extent of support or timeline. We have access to the public SDK&#x27;s like everyone else, and there&#x27;s nothing fundamentally stopping us, or you, from developing support, or shipping Apple Vision Pro applications with Unreal Engine.&quot; 

The VR blog notes that this follows Unreal Engine 5.2&#x27;s native support for Apple Silicon Macs. And &quot;meanwhile, Unity&#x27;s recent pricing changes have led some developers to consider alternatives like UE and Godot.&quot; 

Thanks to Slashdot reader NiftySparks for sharing the article.

                              <span>From an EFF announcement this week:
Technical standards like fire and electrical codes developed by private organizations but incorporated into public law can be freely disseminated without any liability for copyright infringement, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday.
 

The judge ruled that posting the materials constituted fair use — so the nonprofit group doing the posting won&#x27;t be liable for copyright infringement. The American Bar Association Journal reports:

The decision is a victory for public-domain advocate Carl Malamud and the group that he founded, Public.Resource.org. The group posts legal materials on its websites, including the standards developed by the three organizations that sued... &quot;It has been over 10 years since plaintiffs filed suit in this case,&quot; said Malamud in a press release by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. &quot;The U.S. Court of Appeals has found decisively in favor of the proposition that citizens must not be relegated to economy-class access to the law.&quot; 

In 2012 Carl Malamud answered questions from Slashdot readers. 

And now, finally, from the EFF&#x27;s announcement:

Tuesday&#x27;s ruling by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upholds the idea that our laws belong to all of us, and we should be able to find, read, and share them free of registration requirements, fees, and other roadblocks... &quot;In a nation governed by the rule of law, private parties have no business controlling who can read, share, and speak the rules to which we are all subject,&quot; EFF Legal Director Corynne McSherry said. &quot;We are pleased that the Court of Appeals upheld what other U.S. courts, including the Supreme Court, have said for almost 200 years: No one should control access to the law.&quot; 

Or, as the EFF puts it on another page, &quot;Copyright cannot trump the essential public interest...&quot; 

Thanks to long-time Slashdot reader schwit1 for sharing the news.

Astron have showcased a 3D rendering of their engine which helps to understand this extremely complicated new powerplant in all of its glory. They also showed a functioning prototype which gives us a glimpse into how the engine could potentially function... The company claims that it weighs an absolutely mind-boggling 35 pounds yet produces horsepower in the region of 160 and about 170 pound-feet of torque. These are insane figures.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this report from TechCrunch:

In March, WordPress.com owner Automattic made a commitment to the fediverse — the decentralized social networks that include the Twitter rival Mastodon and others — with the acquisition of an ActivityPub plug-in that allows WordPress blogs to reach readers on other federated platforms. Now, the company is announcing ActivityPub 1.0.0 for WordPress has been released allowing WordPress blogs to be followed by others on apps like Mastodon and others in the fediverse and then receive replies back as comments on their own sites. 

Since the acquisition, the company has improved on the original software in a number of ways, including by now allowing the ability to add blog-wide catchall accounts instead of only per-author. It also introduced the ability to add a &quot;follow me&quot; block to help visitors follow your profile and a &quot;followers&quot; block to show off your followers, noted Automattic design engineer Matt Wiebe, in a post on X... For the time being, the software supports self-hosted WordPress blogs, but Wiebe teased that support for WordPress.com blogs was &quot;coming soon.&quot;

 
Last year Automattic&#x27;s CEO Matt Mullenweg announced Tumblr would add support for ActivityPub, the article adds. &quot;But more recently, Mullenweg told us he&#x27;s been investigating not only ActivityPub, but also other protocols like Nostr and Bluesky&#x27;s AT Protocol.&quot;

The map aims to show how both the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act &quot;are leading to announcements of historic levels of private sector investments in the United States,&quot; which the head of America&#x27;s Energy Department credited for &quot;a manufacturing renaissance across the U.S.&quot; A senior White House energy advisor specifically described it as &quot;a clean energy boom&quot; and called the map &quot;a great resource for understanding the widespread and important impact this boom is having on communities all across our nation.&quot; 

The announcement notes 500 &quot;planned investments in at least 450 new or expanded clean energy manufacturing facilities, totaling over $160 billion in announced private and public sector investments&quot; in solar, battery, and offshore wind manufacturing projects — as well as in electric vehicle assembly, components, and chargers. Ford received over $12 billion for battery pack/cell projects and EV assembly, along with billions more for Ford&#x27;s joint venture with BlueOval SK to build a battery plant. And six of the projects are Tesla — totalling over $2 billion for projects in battery materials, cells, packs, and EV assembly.

                              <span>Slashdot reader Leading Edge Boomer wants to help &quot;a retired friend whose personal computing has always been with Windows.&quot; 

But recently, they were gifted a laptop that&#x27;s running &quot;some version of Linux...&quot;

Probably he&#x27;s not even aware that there are different distributions for different purposes. He seems open to learning about this different world. What recommendations might Slashdot readers have to bring him up to speed as a competent Linux user? I really don&#x27;t want to hold his hand, and he&#x27;s smart enough to learn on his own. 
&quot;Mint is the answer,&quot; argues long-time Slashdot reader denisbergeron. &quot;First make him use Mint, because it&#x27;s easy and there a lot of documentation and the community is very strong.&quot; 

But long-time Slashdot reader spaceman375 thinks they can solve the problem with just three letters. &quot;Show him the man command. When he feels confident, or breaks it pretty hard, then I&#x27;d agree — install mint and go from there. But start with man.&quot; 
Is that it? Is it as simple as that? Share your own thoughts and opinions in the comments — along with your learning tools for beginners.

In July Loeb retrieved parts of a meteor that landed in the waters off of Papua, New Guinea in 2014. A local New York newscast describes the find as &quot;metallic marbles, less than a millimeter in diameter,&quot; while Loeb called them &quot;beautiful spheres that were colored — blue, brown or gold.&quot; 

Now USA Today reports:
Early analysis shows that some spherules from the meteor path contain &quot;extremely high abundances&quot; of an unheard-of composition of heavy elements. Researchers on the team say the composition of beryllium, lanthanum and uranium, labeled as a &quot;BeLaU&quot; composition, do…</span>

                              <span>At 103 miles/kWh (or 0.6 kWh/100 km), the new &quot;muc22&quot; car built by students from the Technical University of Munich &quot;is 25 times more efficient than any EV on sale...&quot; writes Ars Technica. &quot;For those who think in terms of miles per gallon, it&#x27;s the equivalent of traveling 3,815 miles on a single gallon of gas. 

The car has a top speed of just 26 mph (42 km/h) — and without a driver it weighs just 374 lbs (170 kg):

In a six-day test at Munich airport, it set a new distance record on a single charge (for a non-solar EV): 1,599 miles (2,574 km), with less battery capacity than many plug-in hybrids — just 15.5 kWh... 


The airflow-optimized shape has faired-in rear wheels and a drag coefficient of just 0.159; more importantly, though, it has a pretty tiny frontal area (it&#x27;s only 39.4 inches/1,000 mm tall and 47.2 inches/1,200 mm wide)... [F]or this record run, muc22 made do with just 400 W — that&#x27;s 268 times less powerful than the least-powerful EV on sale today, the Mazda MX-30... The record run took place in an empty hangar at Munich Airport, obviating any interference from the weather. The previous record stood at 999 miles (1,609 km), but the team of seven drivers reached that distance after just four days, and since the battery wasn&#x27;t empty yet, the car kept going.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this report from CNN:

China appears to have suspended its surveillance balloon program following a major diplomatic incident earlier this year, when one of the country&#x27;s high-altitude spy balloons transited the United States, multiple sources familiar with US intelligence assessments told CNN. US officials believe that Chinese leaders have made a deliberate decision not to launch additional balloons since the one over the US was shot down by American fighter jets in February, the sources said. The US has not observed any new launches since the episode occurred... The US intelligence community believes that Chinese Communist Party leaders did not intend for the balloon to cross over the United States, and even reprimanded the operators of the surveillance program…</span>

                              <span>This week saw the public beta-testing release of &quot;Linux Mint Debian Edition&quot;. Besides listing download locations, its release notes also list out the project&#x27;s three goals: 
- Ensure Linux Mint would be able to continue to deliver the same user experience
- See how much work would be involved if Ubuntu was ever to disappear. 
- Guarantee the software we develop is compatible outside of Ubuntu. 


9to5Linux reports:
Based on the Debian GNU/Linux 12 &quot;Bookworm&quot; operating system series, Linux Mint Debian Edition 6 is powered by the long-term supported Linux 6.1 LTS kernel series and features the latest Cinnamon 5.8 desktop environment that was introduced with the Linux Mint 21.2 &quot;Victoria&quot; release in July 2023â¦ [T]his release comes with a new look and feel thanks to newly added folder icons with different color variants, improved consistency of tooltips to look the same across different apps and desktops, support for symbolic icons that adapt to their background, and full support for HEIF and AVIF

                              <span>The Wall Street Journal reports that more companies are phasing out &quot;feedback&quot; bosses give to workers — and replacing it with &quot;feedforward.&quot; 
&quot;The idea is that &#x27;feedforward&#x27; gives people less anxiety,&quot; the Journal&#x27;s reporter said in a video interview. &quot;It&#x27;s a little bit gentler. When people hear &#x27;feedback&#x27;, they think immediately, &#x27;What have I done wrong? What are the bad things my boss is going to tell me to fix?&#x27;&quot;

And another reason that we&#x27;re hearing &quot;feedforward&quot; at these companies over and over is employees are younger. Younger employees make up a larger percentage of the workforce today, and a number of experts with whom we spoke said that younger employees are more comfortable with gentler terms like &quot;feedforward&quot;...

ExxonMobil executives privately sought to undermine climate science even after the oil and gas giant publicly acknowledged the link between fossil fuel emissions and climate change, according to previously unreported documents revealed by the Wall Street Journal. 

The new revelations are based on previously unreported documents subpoenaed by New York&#x27;s attorney general as part of an investigation into the company announced in 2015. They add to a slew of documents that record a decades-long misinformation campaign waged by Exxon, which are cited in a growing number of state and municipal lawsuits against big oil... In 2008, Exxon pledged to stop funding climate-denier groups. But that very same year, company leadership said it would…</span>

                              <span>When Linus Torvalds announced Linux kernel 6.6&#x27;s first release candidate, it included a newly-stable version of KSMBD, which is Samsung&#x27;s in-kernel server for the SMB protocol (for sharing files/folders/printers over a network). 

An announcement in 2021 had said that &quot;For many cases the current userspace server choices were suboptimal either due to memory footprint, performance or difficulty integrating well with advanced Linux features.&quot; 

LWN noted at the time that Linux has been using &quot;the user-space Samba solution since shortly after the beginning.&quot;
 In a sense, ksmbd is not meant to compete with Samba; indeed, it has been developed in cooperation with the Samba project. It is, however, meant to be a more performant and focused solution than Samba is; at this point, Samba includes a g…</span>

                              <span>This week saw an announcement from the University of Chicago&#x27;s Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering. A new type of vaccine &quot;has shown in the lab setting that it can completely reverse autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes — all without shutting down the rest of the immune system.&quot;

A typical vaccine teaches the human immune system to recognize a virus or bacteria as an enemy that should be attacked. The new &quot;inverse vaccine&quot; does just the opposite: it removes the immune system&#x27;s memory of one molecule. While such immune memory erasure would be unwanted for infectious diseases, it can stop autoimmune reactions like those seen in multiple sclerosis, type I diabetes, or rheumatoid arthritis, in which the immune system attacks a person&#x27;s healthy tissues.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Space.com: Firefly Aerospace just set a new responsive-launch record. The company&#x27;s Alpha rocket lifted off from Vandenberg Space Force Base on Thursday (Sept. 14) at 10:28 p.m. EDT (7:28 p.m. local California time; 0228 GMT on Sept. 15), kicking off a mission for the U.S. Space Force called Victus Nox. The rocket roared off the pad just 27 hours after the U.S. Space Force gave the order -- less time than on any previous national security mission. The wheels for Victus Nox (Latin for &quot;conquer the night&quot;) began turning in September 2022, when the Space Force awarded contracts to Texas-based Firefly and Millennium Space Systems, a Boeing subsidiary headquartered in the Los Angeles area that built the mission&#x27;s payload.

                              <span>A spacecraft left behind by U.S. astronauts on the lunar surface could be causing small tremors known as moonquakes, according to a new study. CNN reports: Researchers revealed the previously unknown form of seismic activity on the moon for the first time through an analysis of Apollo-era data using modern algorithms. Massive temperature swings that occur on the moon can cause human-made structures to expand and contract in a way that produces these vibrations, the report suggests. The lunar surface is an extreme environment, oscillating between minus 208 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 133 degrees Celsius) in the dark and 250 degrees Fahrenheit (121 degrees Celsius) in direct sun, according to a news release about the study.
 
In fact, the entire surface of the moon expands and contracts in the cold and heat, noted the study published September 5 in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets. Yet scientists were able to use a form of artificial intelligence to gain such an intimate understanding of the Apollo-era data that they could pinpoint gentle tremors that emitted from an Apollo 17 lunar lander module sitting a few hundred yards away from instruments recording the moonquakes, according to a synopsis of the study, which was led by Francesco Civilini, a recent California Institute of Technology postdoctoral researcher and a research space scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. (NASA provided funding for the study.)
 
The analysis offers new insights into how the moon responds to its surroundings and what can affect its seismic activities. The rumbles were not dangerous and likely would be imperceptible to humans standing on the moon&#x27;s surface.

It also requires only 20 watts of electric current to operate and in a test campaign generated 1.25 millinewtons of thrust at a specific impulse of 185 seconds on a sustained basis. To put that into perspective, that&#x27;s half a billion times less thrust than the engines used on the Space Shuttle.
 
However, the party trick of the ICE-Cube Thruster is that it uses ordinary water as its propellant, which is about as non-explosive and non-flammable as you can get. Onboard electric current creates electrolysis to break down the water into hydrogen and oxygen, which is fed into the combustion chamber to ignite, generating thrust to maneuver the CubeSat. Using water is not only very green, it also reduces payload because no pressurization is needed to store it, so storage and handling systems can be lighter and simpler. However, fabricating the combustion chamber and nozzle for the thruster in what is essentially two dimensions required taking a page from microelectronics by using the Micro-Electrical Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technique normally employed for machining silicon wafers for processors to sub-micrometer tolerances.

                              <span>Honda&#x27;s new Motocompacto is a throwback all-electric ridable inspired by the short-lived scooter of the &#x27;80s. Engadget reports: The vehicle, folded up, resembles one of those Costco folding tables but with little aluminum wheels poking out the bottom. To transform it into a scooter, you extend the handlebars, seats and back wheel, and ride away on something vaguely approximating a bike. (To give you some perspective on the design, this thing is just over three feet long.)
 
Honda says its aluminum frame and wheels keep it &quot;lightweight&quot; but at 41 pounds it&#x27;s firmly in the same weight class as regular e-bikes, and with a range of &quot;up to 12 miles,&quot; it&#x27;s not getting you very far either. After its 12-mile range is used up, it can be re-juiced in 3.5 hours, which is a considerable amount of time, but at least it comes with an on-board charger ready for you to plug into a 110V outlet. It&#x27;ll be available starting in November priced &quot;under $995&quot; exclusively on Honda&#x27;s website and at Honda and Acura dealers.

                              <span>Thousands of people in Oregon have signed up to experience tripping on magic mushrooms at America&#x27;s first license psilocybin service center. The Associated Press reports: Epic Healing Eugene -- America&#x27;s first licensed psilocybin service center -- opened in June, marking Oregon&#x27;s unprecedented step in offering the mind-bending drug to the public. The center now has a waitlist of more than 3,000 names, including people with depression, PTSD or end-of-life dread. No prescription or referral is needed, but proponents hope Oregon&#x27;s legalization will spark a revolution in mental health care. The Oregon Psilocybin Services Section, charged with regulating the state&#x27;s industry, has received &quot;hundreds of thousands of inquiries from all over the world,&quot; Angela Allbee, the agency&#x27;s manager, said in an interview. &quot;So far, what we&#x27;re hearing is that clients have had positive experiences,&quot; she said.
 
First, customers must have a preparation session with a licensed facilitator who stays with clients as they experience the drug. The facilitator can deny access to those who have active psychosis, thoughts of harming anyone, or who have taken lithium, which is used to treat mania, in the past month. The clients can&#x27;t buy mushrooms to go, and they must stay at the service center until the drug wears off. Oregon Psilocybin Services spent two years establishing regulations and began accepting license applications in January. There are now 10 licensed service centers, four growers, two testing labs and dozens of facilitators. [...] The report notes that costs can be high, with some clients paying over $2,000 and annual licenses for service centers and growers costing $10,000, with a half-price discount for veterans.
 
As for doses, state regulations allow up to 50 milligrams but it will ultimately depend on the facility and client. One of the facility&#x27;s first clients took 35 milligrams and described seeing a &quot;kind of infinite-dimension fractal that just kept turning and twisting.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from the International Association of Privacy Professionals: The California State Legislature passed Senate Bill 362, the Delete Act, which is designed to streamline consumers&#x27; ability to request the deletion of their personal information collected by data brokers. The bill now awaits the signature of Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., though he reportedly has given no indication whether he will sign the bill, according to CBS News. Newsom has until 14 Oct. to sign the bill. Should it become law, the Delete Act would empower the CPPA to develop a system by 2026 that allows residents to make a single data deletion request across the nearly 500 registered data brokers operating in the state. The CPPA would also be charged with enforcing provisions of the Delete Act, such as requiring data broker registration and ensuring brokers delete an individual&#x27;s personal information every 45 days upon receipt of a verified request. [...]
 
The Delete Act was first introduced by state Sen. Josh Becker, D-Calif., who previously said the legislation patches a loophole in the California Consumer Privacy Act that allowed for consumers to request individual data brokers delete information obtained directly from them but did not require entities to delete personal information aggregated from other sources. &quot;Data brokers spend their days and nights building dossiers with millions of people&#x27;s reproductive healthcare, geolocation, and purchasing data so they can sell it to the highest bidder,&quot; Becker said after the bill originally passed in the Senate in May. &quot;The Delete Act is based on a very simple premise: Every Californian should be able to control who has access to their personal information and what they can do with it.&quot;

                              <span>According to The Information, Google is nearing the release of Gemini, its conversational artificial intelligence software intended to compete with OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-4 model. Reuters reports: For Google, the stakes of Gemini&#x27;s launch are high. Google has intensified investments in generative AI this year as it plays catch-up after Microsoft-backed OpenAI&#x27;s launch of ChatGPT last year took the tech world by storm. Gemini is a collection of large-language models that power everything from chatbots to features that either summarize text or generate original text based on what users want to read like email drafts, music lyrics, or news stories, the report said. It is also expected to help software engineers write code and generate original images based on what users ask to see.
 
Google is currently giving developers access to a relatively large version of Gemini, but not the largest version it is developing which would be more on par with GPT-4, the report said. The search and advertising giant plans to make Gemini available to companies through its Google Cloud Vertex AI service.

                              <span>According to Ars Technica&#x27;s Andrew Cunningham, the iPhone 15 devices &quot;have completely standard USB-C ports that work just fine with all existing USB 3 and USB-PD (Power Delivery) compliant cables, chargers, and accessories, just like Apple&#x27;s other devices.&quot; It contradicts rumors that Apple&#x27;s implementation of USB-C would limit data and charging speeds for any accessories not certified through its Made for iPhone (MFI) program. From the report: We&#x27;ll still need to test the phones to know for sure how they&#x27;ll behave with different things plugged into them, but all of Apple&#x27;s official authentication-chip-less USB-C chargers and cables quietly had their compatibility tables updated this week to include all iPhone 15 models. That also includes chargers from third parties like Mophie and Belkin that pre-date the iPhone 15&#x27;s introduction.
 
That&#x27;s not to say that there won&#x27;t be some kind of licensing program available for iPhone-compatible USB-C accessories. But fears that these cables would be required, and that the iPhone wouldn&#x27;t work just fine with otherwise standards-compliant USB-C cables and chargers, were unfounded.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Reuters: Google agreed to pay $155 million to settle claims by California and private plaintiffs that the search engine company misled consumers about how it tracks their locations, and used their data without consent. Both settlements resolve claims that the Alphabet unit deceived people into believing they maintained control over how Google collected and used their personal data. The company was accused of being able to &quot;profile&quot; people and target them with advertising even if they turned off their &quot;Location History&quot; setting, and deceive people about their ability to block ads they did not want.
 
The California settlement requires Google to pay $93 million, and disclose more about how it tracks people&#x27;s whereabouts and uses data it collects. Money from Google&#x27;s $62 million settlement with private plaintiffs would, after deducting legal fees, go to court-approved nonprofit groups that track internet privacy concerns. Lawyers for the plaintiffs said this made sense because it was &quot;infeasible&quot; to distribute money to the approximately 247.7 million U.S. adults with mobile devices. &quot;Google was telling its users one thing--that it would no longer track their location once they opted out--but doing the opposite and continuing to track its users&#x27; movements for its own commercial gain,&quot; California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement. &quot;That&#x27;s unacceptable.&quot;

                              <span>Apple has agreed to install updates for the iPhone 12 in France after French regulators ordered the company to stop selling the model because it emits electromagnetic radiation levels that exceed European Union standards. From a report: The company, which just unveiled its newest generation of iPhones, insists the 12 model is safe and the phones have been certified in countries around the world since its introduction in 2020. It says the problem raised by the French government agency that manages wireless communications frequencies is &quot;related to a specific testing protocol.&quot; 

The French agency said the iPhone 12 recently failed one of two types of tests for electromagnetic waves capable of being absorbed by the body. On Tuesday, France&#x27;s government ordered a halt to sales of the iPhone 12 and told Apple to issue a software update to address the problem or face a recall. Apple said in a statement Friday that it &quot;will issue a software update for users in France to accommodate the protocol used by French regulators.&quot; It did not elaborate.

                              <span>Among the hotel patrons snarled in the fallout of MGM Resorts&#x27; cyberattack was -- unfortunately for the company -- one very high-profile figure: Lina Khan, the chair of the US Federal Trade Commission. Bloomberg News: On Tuesday night, she was among the 45 people waiting to check in at the MGM Grand along the Las Vegas strip as staff worked to manually fulfill everyone&#x27;s reservation, according to people familiar with the matter. When Khan and her staff got to the front of the line, an employee at the desk asked them to write down their credit card information on a piece of paper. 

As the leader of the federal agency that, among other things, ensures companies protect consumer data wrote down her details, Khan asked the worker: How exactly was MGM managing the data security around this situation? The desk agent shrugged and said he didn&#x27;t know, according to a senior aide who was traveling with Khan and described the experience to Bloomberg as surreal. Khan was among the thousands of MGM hotel patrons inconvenienced in the aftermath of the hack, which was said to be orchestrated by a group of hackers known as Scattered Spider. Days after the incident, many of the company&#x27;s websites -- including its reservation system -- were still displaying error messages, some slot machines at its casinos across the country are still out of service and employees were handling processes manually.

                              <span>Plex informed some users this week that it will no longer allow users to run servers at a hosting provider where lots of TOS violations occur. TorrentFreak: In an email to customers who run Plex servers at the large German hosting company Hetzner, Plex said that access will be blocked next month. It&#x27;s not clear if Hetzner is the only hosting company this applies to, but several customers confirmed that they received the same email. Plex&#x27;s notice doesn&#x27;t mention Hetzner by name, nor is piracy cited as the reason. The email simply refers to violations of its Terms of Service. 

&quot;You&#x27;re receiving this notice because the IP address associated with a Plex Media Server on your account appears to come from a service provider that hosts a significant number of Plex Media Servers that violate our Terms of Service,&quot; the Plex email reads. &quot;Due to the large-scale violations occurring from that hosting provider, we will be taking action soon to block access and activity from Plex Media Servers hosted by that provider.&quot;

                              <span>Iranian hackers have hacked dozens of companies in the defense, satellite and pharmaceutical sectors this year using a fairly unsophisticated, blunt hacking technique, Microsoft warned in a new report. From a report: Many of these companies are based in the U.S., and the breaches come amid heavy U.S. sanctions targeting Iranian oil and petrochemical sales. Microsoft said Thursday that Iranian hacking group Peach Sandstorm -- which other firms also refer to as APT33, Elfin or Refined Kitten -- has been breaking into these companies by trying to guess multiple user accounts&#x27; passwords. 

The password-spraying campaign took place between February and July this year, Microsoft found. In some cases, the hackers were able to exfiltrate data, and in others, they just lurked on the networks to see what intelligence they could gather. The Iranian group targeted thousands of companies as part of this monthslong campaign -- but was able to access only a small percentage of those organizations, Microsoft said.

                              <span>A security company is calling out a feature in Google&#x27;s authenticator app that it says made a recent internal network breach much worse. ArsTechnica: Retool, which helps customers secure their software development platforms, made the criticism on Wednesday in a post disclosing a compromise of its customer support system. The breach gave the attackers responsible access to the accounts of 27 customers, all in the cryptocurrency industry. The attack started when a Retool employee clicked a link in a text message purporting to come from a member of the company&#x27;s IT team. It warned that the employee would be unable to participate in the company&#x27;s open enrollment for health care coverage until an account issue was fixed. The text arrived while Retool was in the process of moving its login platform to security company Okta. 

Most of the targeted Retool employees took no action, but one logged in to the linked site and, based on the wording of the poorly written disclosure, presumably provided both a password and a temporary one-time password, or TOTP, from Google authenticator. Shortly afterward, the employee received a phone call from someone who claimed to be an IT team member and had familiarity with the &quot;floor plan of the office, coworkers, and internal processes of our company.&quot; During the call, the employee provided an &quot;additional multi-factor code.&quot; It was at this point, the disclosure contended, that a sync feature Google added to its authenticator in April magnified the severity of the breach because it allowed the attackers to compromise not just the employee&#x27;s account but a host of other company accounts as well.

                              <span>Gallup blog: Most Americans think artificial intelligence (AI) will negatively affect the U.S. job market, with 75% saying it will decrease the total number of jobs over the next 10 years. About one in five (19%) believe AI will not affect the number of jobs, while 6% say it will result in an increase in jobs. U.S. adults with less than a bachelor&#x27;s degree are more likely than those with a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher to say AI will decrease the number of jobs (80% vs. 68%, respectively). Younger Americans are less pessimistic than their older counterparts about AI, with two-thirds of adults aged 18 to 29 saying it will decrease the total number of jobs, compared with 72% of 30- to 44-year-olds, 79% of 45- to 59-year-olds, and 80% of those aged 60 and older. 

Results for the Bentley-Gallup Business in Society study are based on web survey responses collected May 8-15, 2023, from 5,458 U.S. adults in Gallup&#x27;s nationally representative panel. While Americans are pessimistic about AI&#x27;s potential impact on the job market, they recognize the benefits AI could bring in some areas. In particular, majorities believe AI performs as well as or better than humans at customizing the content users see online (68%), recommending products or services to them (65%) and assisting students with coursework (60%). Across all nine tasks included in the study, Americans are the least positive about AI&#x27;s ability to recommend which employees a company should hire, its self-driving capabilities and its ability to recommend medical advice. About two-thirds of Americans believe AI performs worse than humans on each of these tasks.

                              <span>Unity announced a new pricing model this week, charging developers per game install beyond certain thresholds. This move has faced severe backlash from developers, criticizing Unity&#x27;s communication, clarity, trust issues, and perceived exploitation of indie teams. The Verge adds: Many developers and even publishers took to social media to register their anger and to call on Unity to reverse its decision. [...] &quot;This decision puts studios in a position where we might not be able to justify using Unity for our future titles,&quot; read a post on X (formerly Twitter) from developer Aggro Crab. &quot;If these changes aren&#x27;t rolled back, we&#x27;ll be heavily considering abandoning our Unity expertise.&quot; Many developers shared a similar sentiment, explaining they were considering abandoning Unity as a game engine. 

Other game developers, like Massive Monster, were more drastic, which, via the official account for its game Cult of the Lamb, threatened to delist the game entirely. Though the post was a tongue-in-cheek joke, it&#x27;s one being repeated by other developers. &quot;[Please] buy our game,&quot; posted the official Viewfinder account. &quot;But don&#x27;t install it after January 1, 2024.&quot; Other game makers wondered how Unity could put forth such a statement without considering all the ways it could negatively impact its users. According to a post on the Unity forums from someone who claimed to be an employee, objections were raised internally. &quot;Know also that all of the concerns that are understandably blowing up at the moment have been raised internally by many weeks before this announcement,&quot; the alleged employee wrote. &quot;Why it was decided to rush this out anyway in this way I can only speculate about.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: The Streaming Era began with a promise of nurturing shows without fear of ratings pressure and quick cancellations. Of course, that was a lark. Soon enough, the streamers began slashing shows as quickly and brutally as any Nielsen-obsessed broadcaster, and they were all flooded with same complaint: &quot;The streamers just cancel everything! Nothing gets more than a season anymore!&quot; How true is that really? After all, the streamers are looking for hit shows, just like traditional networks. If a show gets high viewership relative to the cost of producing it, it gets renewed. Otherwise, it is canceled. That is how it has worked since the days of black-and-white TV. 

To get to the heart of the matter, Variety Intelligence Platform (VIP+) and Luminate collaborated on a data exploration to determine how often the leading U.S.-based streaming and linear programmers have canceled series TV series over the past three years. The new report, &quot;The Show Must Go Off,&quot; is an exhaustive statistical analysis that aims to settle one of the most hotly contested debates in the TV industry. The data covered all shows (scripted and unscripted) canceled between 2020 and Aug. 8, 2023. The major streamers (Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, Max, Apple TV+, Peacock, Paramount+) overall had a combined average cancellation rate of 12.2% -- not much higher than linear TV (10.8%), but less than half of broadcast TV alone over that period. Warner Bros. Discovery-owned Max (formerly HBO Max) was by far the most brutal when it comes to cancelling shows, coming in at 26.9%.

                              <span>Oil companies have been granted licences by the UK government that it hopes will enable them to store up to 10% of the UK&#x27;s carbon emissions in old oil and gasfields beneath the seabed. From a report: The government awarded more than 20 North Sea licences covering an area the size of Yorkshire to 14 companies that plan to store carbon dioxide trapped from heavy industry in depleted oil and gasfields. The companies include the oil supermajor Shell, Italy&#x27;s state-owned oil company ENI, and Harbour Energy, the largest independent oil and gas company operating in the UK&#x27;s North Sea basin. 

The industry&#x27;s government-backed regulator, the North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA), claims the companies could help store up to 30m tonnes of CO2 a year by 2030, or approximately 10% of UK annual emissions. The plan to develop old oil and gasfields into vast repositories of CO2 is part of the government&#x27;s plan to develop a carbon capture and storage (CCS) industry to reduce emissions from heavy industry entering the atmosphere and contributing to global heating. Stuart Payne, the NSTA&#x27;s chief executive, said: &quot;Carbon storage will play a crucial role in the energy transition, storing carbon dioxide deep under the seabed and playing a key role in hydrogen production and energy hubs.&quot;

                              <span>TikTok has been fined 345 million euros ($370 million) for breaching privacy laws regarding the processing of children&#x27;s personal data in the European Union, its lead regulator in the bloc said on Friday. From a report: The Chinese-owned short-video platform, which has grown rapidly among teenagers around the world in recent years, breached a number of EU privacy laws between July 31, 2020, and Dec. 31, 2020, Ireland&#x27;s Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) said in a statement. It is the first time ByteDance-owned TikTok has been reprimanded by the DPC, the lead regulator in the EU for many of the world&#x27;s top tech firms due to the location of their regional headquarters in Ireland. 

A spokesperson for TikTok said it disagreed with the decision, particularly the size of the fine, and that most of the criticisms are no longer relevant as a result of measures it introduced before the DPC&#x27;s probe began in September 2021. The DPC said TikTok&#x27;s breaches included how in 2020 accounts for users under the age of 16 were set to &quot;public&quot; by default and that TikTok did not verify whether a user was actually a child user&#x27;s parent or guardian when linked through the &quot;family pairing&quot; feature.

                              <span>Getting our applications out of the cloud provided the main celebration for our exit, but seeing the actual spend tumble is the prize. See, the only way to get pricing in the cloud down from obscene to merely offensive is through reserved instances. This is where you sign up for a year or more in advance on a certain level of spend. Therefore, we didn&#x27;t get the instant collapse in our bills after the applications were moved, but now it&#x27;s coming. Oh it&#x27;s coming!
  
      
        

  
Our cloud spend (sans-S3) is down by 60% already. From around $180,000/month to less than $80,000. That&#x27;s a cool million dollars in savings at the yearly run rate, and we have another big drop coming in September, before the remaining spend will petter out through the rest of the year.
Now compare that to what…</span>

                              <span>Amazon.com has introduced a generative AI service that it claims will &quot;dramatically improve the listing creation and management experience for sellers.&quot; The company says the AI &quot;will simplify how Amazon sellers create more thorough and captivating product descriptions&quot; and &quot;enrich existing listings, helping customers more confidently make purchase decisions.&quot; The Register reports: Using an unspecified large language model, Amazon will allow sellers to enter &quot;a brief description of the product in a few words or sentences&quot; and then &quot;generate high-quality content for their review.&quot; Sellers can review the AI output, or just &quot;directly submit the automatically generated content to the Amazon catalog.&quot; Amazon reckons the results will offer customers &quot;more complete, consistent, and engaging product information that will enhance their shopping experiences.&quot;
 
Authors who post their works to the e-tail elephant&#x27;s Kindle bookstore also need to consider AI as last week the content guidelines for e-book authors and publishers added a requirement to disclose machine-generated content &quot;when you publish a new book or make edits to and republish an existing book.&quot; Amazon wants to be told of any AI-generated images, texts, or translations. Altering the work of an AI does not exempt authors and publishers from this requirement, as Amazon&#x27;s definition of &quot;AI-generated&quot; includes material generated by a machine that received &quot;substantial edits&quot; by a human. AI-assisted content -- defined as material created by a human and then offered to a machine for edits, refinements, error-checks or other improvements -- doesn&#x27;t have to be disclosed.

                              <span>Global cryptocurrency exchange CoinEX announced that someone hacked its hot wallets and stole large amounts of digital assets that were used to support the platform&#x27;s operations. BleepingComputer reports: The incident occurred on September 12 and preliminary results of the investigation show that the unauthorized transactions involved Ethereum ($ETH), Tron ($TRON), and Polygon ($MATIC) cryptocurrency. CoinEx has not provided any info about the financial impact incurred, as the investigation has yet to determine the complete losses.
 
However, a report from blockchain security firm PeckShield says that the attack drained CoinEx of about $19 million in $ETH, $11 million in $TRON, $6.4 million in Smart Chain Coin ($BSC), $6 million in Bitcoin (BTC), and approximately $295,000 in (MATIC). According to PeckShield, the loss from this attack amounts to about $43 million, while the remaining $72 million kept on the same stash has been transferred to better-protected cold wallets.
 
A more recent estimation on the CoinEx losses coming from CertiK Alert raises the figure to $53 million, analyzed as seen in this document. User assets have not been impacted by the incident, CoinEx said, and assuring that any parties suffering loss will receive full compensation. At the time of writing, all deposit and withdrawal services on CoinEx have been suspended to protect user assets and will only resume after the exchange&#x27;s IT team makes sure that all risk has been eliminated.

The company pioneered the use of huge presses with 6,000 to 9,000 tons of clamping pressure to mold the front and rear structures of its Model Y in a &quot;gigacasting&quot; process that slashed production costs and left rivals scrambling to catch up. In a bid to extend its lead, Tesla is closing in on an innovation that would allow it to die cast nearly all the complex underbody of an EV in one piece, rather than about 400 parts in a conventional car, the people said.

European Union member states, which were notified by the French regulator on Wednesday, have three months to provide comments. Some, such as Italy, said they would take no steps for now.

                              <span>GoDaddy needs to cut more jobs, reduce the tech budget, and address why it is falling short of financial targets outlined at its shareholder day in 2022, or the board should consider exploring a sale of the business. From a report: This is the view from activist investor Starboard Blue LLP, GoDaddy&#x27;s third largest shareholder and one which is agitating for change and a seat on the corporation&#x27;s board, something it has so far failed to secure. An open letter [PDF] to GoDaddy&#x27;s top brass starts off friendly enough, with Starboard Value managing member Peter Feld describing the business as a &quot;one-stop shop for micro- and small-businesses looking to develop a web presence.&quot; 

Feld says Starboard Value invested in the stock, a move it made public in early 2022, on the basis of opportunities for strong revenue growth, &quot;meaningful margin expansion&quot; and a &quot;more appropriate capital allocation strategy.&quot; &quot;Unfortunately, despite each of these opportunities remaining, over the last 18 months we have been disappointed by GoDaddy&#x27;s operational, financial and stock price performance,&quot; the letter adds. At the investor day, GoDaddy projected compound annual growth in revenue of 10 percent between 2022 and 2024, as well as 15 percent EBITDA, 20 percent free cashflow per share and $3 billion in share buybacks.

                              <span>A luxury cruise ship that had been stuck for three days after running aground off the coast of Greenland was pulled free on Thursday morning, the authorities said. From a report: The ship, the Ocean Explorer, had been carrying 206 passenger and crew members and was headed toward Alpefjord, in a remote corner of Greenland. The ship&#x27;s destination was the Northeast Greenland National Park, the world&#x27;s northernmost national park, which is home to icebergs, glaciers and high mountains. The Joint Arctic Command, which is part of Denmark&#x27;s defense forces, and SunStone Maritime Group, the coordinators of the rescue operation, said in statements on Thursday that the ship had been pulled free by a vessel named Tarajoq. 

There were no reported injuries on board the ship, and there was no threat to the environment. The ship&#x27;s operator, Aurora Expeditions, a cruise company based in Australia, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The rescue came after an unsuccessful attempt on Wednesday, in which a fishing research vessel owned by the government of Greenland tried and failed to pull free the Ocean Explorer at high tide. Bad weather also slowed the government&#x27;s rescue operations, officials said. Before the ship was freed, the Joint Arctic Command had said that &quot;the crew and passengers are in a difficult situation, but after the circumstances, the atmosphere on the ship is good and everyone on board is fine.&quot;

                              <span>California, the home to many of tech&#x27;s biggest companies and the nation&#x27;s most populous state, is pushing ahead with a right-to-repair bill for consumer electronics and appliances. From a report: After unanimous votes in the state Assembly and Senate, the bill passed yesterday is expected to move through a concurrence vote and be signed by Governor Gavin Newsom. &quot;Since Right to Repair can pass here, expect it to be on its way to a backyard near you,&quot; said iFixit CEO Kyle Wiens in a statement. iFixit, a seller of repair parts and tools and advocate for right-to-repair laws, based in San Luis Obispo, California, was joined in its support for the California repair law by another California company with a history of opposing repair laws: Apple. The consumer tech giant&#x27;s letter urging passage of the bill was surprising, to say the least, though Apple said that the bill&#x27;s stipulations for &quot;individual users&#x27; safety&quot; and &quot;product manufacturers&#x27; intellectual property&quot; were satisfactory. 

California&#x27;s bill goes further than right-to-repair laws in other states. Rather than limiting its demand that companies provide parts, tools, repair manuals, and necessary software for devices that are still actively sold, California requires that vendors provide those items for products sold after July 1, 2021, starting in July 2024. Products costing $50 to $99.99 must be accompanied by those items for three years, and items $100 and more necessitate seven years. The bill also provides for stronger enforcement mechanisms, allowing for municipalities to bring superior court cases rather than contact the state attorney general.

From the report: Unity, the maker of tools and technology for video games, set off a firestorm on Sept. 12 by announcing it will begin charging developers a new fee for games made using its software, called the Unity Engine. Beginning Jan. 1, makers of Unity games will have to pay per user installation after a certain threshold is reached. Some video-game makers accused Unity of violating its own terms of service and lamented that the new charges could threaten their livelihoods. Many game studios put out harshly worded statements urging the technology company to reconsider.

                              <span>Google is working to push back the expiration date of Chromebooks, addressing concerns held by school administrators that the laptops are too short-lived to be cost effective. From a report: The Alphabet-owned company -- which develops the Chrome operating system running on computers made mostly by others -- said Thursday it plans to provide software updates for Chromebooks for up to a decade. The new policy, which starts next year, ensures that no existing Chromebook will expire within the next two years. The disclosure of this policy change comes after an August column in The Wall Street Journal detailing schools&#x27; struggles with expiring Chromebooks. Chromebooks are ubiquitous in classrooms around the country, but some education software doesn&#x27;t work after what Google calls the Auto Update Expiration date. Unsupported Chromebooks can&#x27;t be used for mandatory state testing, even if the hardware still appears functional. 

When the laptops expire, school districts recycle them, sometimes at a cost, and spend millions of dollars on replacements. Google currently sets expiration dates based on the release date of specific models. Newer models have eight years of support, while older Chromebooks have five. Starting in 2024, Google will support a given laptop &quot;platform&quot; -- a certain combination of hardware components -- for 10 years after the first device in the platform hits store shelves. These so-called platforms aren&#x27;t unique to specific brands or manufacturers and can be found in a variety of distinct models.

                              <span>HP is the latest company to announce a foldable-screen PC. From a report: The 17-inch Spectre Foldable PC has a keyboard that can be used wirelessly with the device propped up on its kickstand. Or you could magnetically attach the keyboard to the screen&#x27;s bottom half or even slide the keyboard toward you for a 1.5-screen-like experience. The OLED device addresses concerns around battery life and portability by including two battery packs instead of one. But the bendy, Intel 12th-gen computer will have to do quite a lot to even begin rationalizing its staggering $5,000 price. The Spectre Fold works as a 17-inch, 0.33-inch (8.5 mm) thick OLED tablet. Uniquely, it has an integrated kickstand for propping the PC up at a 120-degree angle. This is key because HP cites the kickstand as one of the reasons the computer is so costly, but this also means you don&#x27;t have to deal with separate origami stands/sleeves. 

With the PC propped up, it should be easy to work with the included wireless keyboard or stylus, which both charge wirelessly on the device. The Bluetooth keyboard can attach to the bottom half of the PC&#x27;s screen for a 12.3-inch laptop view. If you slide the keyboard down toward you, revealing more of the OLED, the PC will automatically display windows north of the keyboard. This scenario is like working on a 14-inch laptop. HP says it worked with Microsoft to customize Windows 11&#x27;s Snap feature so it&#x27;s easy to bring a window or two to the space above the docked keyboard. Lenovo&#x27;s Yoga Book 9i, a clamshell laptop with a second OLED screen where you&#x27;d expect the keyboard and touchpad to be, also lets you place windows on top of a docked keyboard. But when I tested that laptop, I typically found looking down physically uncomfortable.

                              <span>The Justice Department will press its argument Thursday that Google sought to strike agreements with mobile carriers to win powerful default positions on smartphones to dominate search in an antitrust trial that could change the future of the internet. From a report: The government will wrap up questioning Thursday of Antonio Rangel, who teaches behavioral biology at the California Institute of Technology. Other witnesses will be James Kolotouros, for Google, and Brian Higgins, from Verizon Communications. The government says the Alphabet unit paid $10 billion annually to wireless companies like AT&amp;T, device makers like Apple and browser makers like Mozilla to fend off rivals and keep its search engine market share near 90%. The government has also alleged that Google illegally took steps to protect communications about the payments. 

The government called witnesses on Tuesday and Wednesday to show that Google, as far back as the mid-2000s, sought to attract a large number of search queries by winning default status on mobile devices. Another witness, Rangel, discussed how powerful default status was, although data he used to show this was largely redacted. Google&#x27;s clout in search, the government alleges, has helped Google build monopolies in some aspects of online search advertising. Search is free so Google makes money through advertising.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s attempt at avoiding deeper European Union scrutiny of its Teams video-conferencing app fell flat with the bloc&#x27;s antitrust enforcers readying a formal complaint against the firm&#x27;s conduct. From a report: Microsoft&#x27;s recent proposal to split its Teams from a broader business software package and sell it to customers separately with an annual discount wasn&#x27;t enough to satisfy regulators&#x27; concerns, according to people familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The European Commission is preparing a statement of objections to send to the company, which could come in the next few months, the people said. At the end of August, Microsoft attempted to allay concerns raised by the EU&#x27;s antitrust arm as part of a new investigation into how it ties Teams to its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 packages. The EU&#x27;s investigation followed a complaint from Salesforce&#x27;s messaging platform Slack some three years ago.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Engadget: The ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware group claimed responsibility for the MGM Resorts cyber outage on Tuesday, according to a post by malware archive vx-underground. The group claims to have used common social engineering tactics, or gaining trust from employees to get inside information, to try and get a ransom out of MGM Resorts, but the company reportedly refuses to pay. The conversation that granted initial access took just 10 minutes, according to the group.
 
&quot;All ALPHV ransomware group did to compromise MGM Resorts was hop on LinkedIn, find an employee, then call the Help Desk,&quot; the organization wrote in a post on X. Those details came from ALPHV, but have not been independently confirmed by security researchers. The international resort chain started experiencing outages earlier this week, as customers noticed slot machines at casinos owned by MGM Resorts shut down on the Las Vegas strip. As of Wednesday morning, MGM Resorts still shows signs that it&#x27;s experiencing downtime, like continued website disruptions. In a statement on Tuesday, MGM Resorts said: &quot;Our resorts, including dining, entertainment and gaming are currently operational.&quot; However, the company said Wednesday that the cyber incident has significantly disrupted properties across the United States and represents a material risk to the company.
 
&quot;[T]he major credit rating agency Moody&#x27;s warned that the cyberattack could negatively affect MGM&#x27;s credit rating, saying the attack highlighted &#x27;key risks&#x27; within the company,&quot; reports CNBC. &quot;The company&#x27;s corporate email, restaurant reservation and hotel booking systems remain offline as a result of the attack, as do digital room keys. MGM on Wednesday filed a 8-K report with the Securities and Exchange Commission noting that on Tuesday the company issued a press release &#x27;regarding a cybersecurity issue involving the Company.&#x27;&quot; MGM&#x27;s share price has declined more than 6% since Monday.

                              <span>&quot;AFRINIC, the regional internet registry for the African continent and Indian Ocean region, has been placed under receivership following an injunction obtained against it in the Supreme Court of Mauritius,&quot; writes Slashdot reader Kelerei. &quot;This appears to be a result of poor governance at AFRINIC, and in part a consequence of an IP address assignment debacle in 2021.&quot; MyBroadband reports: Industry players on both sides of a conflict involving the registry have welcomed the Mauritian Supreme Court&#x27;s latest ruling, as it potentially creates a path to reconstitute the ailing entity&#x27;s board and appoint a CEO. Headquartered in Mauritius, AFRINIC found itself on the wrong side of the country&#x27;s corporate governance laws after repeatedly ignoring warnings from its members and community about the danger. It also disregarded judgments on some occasions, with the courts warning AFRINIC that it was in danger of being held in contempt. The blow that finally left Afrinic without a quorate board and ultimately without a CEO was struck by Crystal Web, a defunct Internet Service Provider that used to offer consumer DSL and fiber broadband in South Africa. Although Crystal Web landed the paralyzing hit, it was hardly the primary litigant in the over 55 court cases brought against AFRINIC since June 2020.

                              <span>Visual effects workers at Marvel Studios have unanimously voted to unionize with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, marking a historic milestone for the industry. Rolling Stone reports: Following the successful vote with the NLRB, Marvel&#x27;s VFX union will now enter into collective bargaining negotiations with Marvel. A start date for those negotiations hasn&#x27;t been announced yet. Underpinning the union drive were the poor working conditions visual effects professionals have endured on Marvel productions, including a lack of pay equity, grueling hours, understaffing, excessive requests for changes, and unfair turnaround times.
 
VFX crews have been a crucial part of film and TV productions since the introduction of visual effects in the first Star Wars films of the 1970s. But while many other backstage/behind-the-scenes crews and professions (such as production designers, editors, lighting, make-up, and props) have long been unionized under the IATSE umbrella, VFX workers largely remained non-union.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from the Associated Press: As young children went back to school across Sweden last month, many of their teachers were putting a new emphasis on printed books, quiet reading time and handwriting practice and devoting less time to tablets, independent online research and keyboarding skills. The return to more traditional ways of learning is a response to politicians and experts questioning whether the country&#x27;s hyper-digitalized approach to education, including the introduction of tablets in nursery schools, had led to a decline in basic skills. Swedish Minister for Schools Lotta Edholm, who took office 11 months ago as part of a new center-right coalition government, was one of the biggest critics of the all-out embrace of technology. &quot;Sweden&#x27;s students …</span>

                              <span>The Justice Department sought on Wednesday to show how Google did all it could to get people to use its search engine and build itself into a $1 trillion search and advertising giant on the second day of a once-in-a-generation antitrust trial. From a report: First out of the gate, the government questioned a former Google executive, Chris Barton, about billion-dollar deals with mobile carriers and others that helped make Google the default search engine. Barton, who was at Google from 2004 to 2011, said the number of Google executives working to win default status with mobile carriers grew dramatically when he was with the company, recognizing the potential growth of handheld devices and early versions of smartphones.

From a report: The first 20 prototype IVAS 1.2 goggles were delivered in late July and assessed by two squads of solders in late August to check for improvements in reliability, low-light performance and how well they fit without repeats of the nausea and dizziness that halted the deployment of earlier versions. The devices, based on Microsoft&#x27;s HoloLens &quot;mixed reality&quot; goggles, &quot;demonstrated improvements in reliability, low light sensor performance, and form factor&quot; in tests last month at Fort Drum, New York, and &quot;soldier feedback was positive,&quot; spokesman David Patterson said in an email.

WSJ: Musk, the CEO of Tesla and owner of X (formerly Twitter), warned about what he views as AI&#x27;s potential to threaten humanity, according to a participant. Microsoft founder Gates said the technology could help address world hunger, said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), who convened the session. Other speakers included Facebook founder Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Google, Microsoft, Nvidia and IBM, along with union leaders.

                              <span>The White House, weighing in for the first time on concerns about a Chinese backlash against Apple, said it is monitoring reports of a growing government ban of iPhones and believes the move is a reprisal against the US. From a report: &quot;It seems to be of a piece of the kinds of aggressive and inappropriate retaliation to US companies that we&#x27;ve seen from the PRC in the past,&quot; said John Kirby, the council&#x27;s spokesman, referring to the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Bloomberg News reported this month that China plans to expand a ban on the use of iPhones to a plethora of state-backed companies and agencies, a sign of growing challenges for Apple in the country. Several Chinese agencies have begun instructing staff not to bring their iPhones to work. 

But the situation grew more muddled Wednesday, when Beijing pushed back on reports about iPhone restrictions while also raising concerns about security problems with the device. &quot;China has not issued laws and regulations to ban the purchase of Apple or foreign brands&#x27; phones,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular press briefing in Beijing on Wednesday. It marked the government&#x27;s first comments on the issue, but didn&#x27;t seem to refer directly to workplace bans of the device.

                              <span>A journalist and researcher on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), or UFOs as they&#x27;re better known, presented the remains of purported &quot;non-human&quot; beings to lawmakers in Mexico on Tuesday during the country&#x27;s first public congressional hearing on the topic. From a report: Jamie Maussan brought two boxes containing what he said were the small, stuffed bodies of extraterrestrials recovered in Peru in 2017. He said carbon-14 dating carried out by the National Autonomous University of Mexico had determined the remains were 700 and 1,800 years old. Each of the figures has only three fingers on each hand and elongated heads, resembling, at least superficially, the Hollywood-born character ET. 

&quot;This is the first time it (extraterrestrial life) is presented in such a form and I think there is a clear demonstration that we are dealing with non-human specimens that are not related to any other species in our world,&quot; Maussan told the lawmakers, urging them to consider the topic, which he said should not be viewed as &quot;a political topic -- it&#x27;s a topic for humanity.&quot; He said DNA evidence could prove the specimens were not of this planet, but it wasn&#x27;t clear if any such tests had been carried out. At least one previous claim by Maussan about purported &quot;non-human&quot; remains discovered in Peru has been debunked, though the specimens he presented Tuesday in Mexico City appeared different to the one he previously spoke about in 2015.

From a report: The daylong, high-profile gathering, featuring Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Sam Altman and other tech figures, has its share of skeptics in both parties. Some senators lamented that the so-called AI Insight Forum is closed to the public and the media. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said it would allow tech billionaires to lobby senators behind closed doors about one of the most critical issues facing the country and economy. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who organized the bipartisan gathering along with Sens. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., Todd Young, R-Ind., and Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., dismissed the criticism, noting that three public hearings on AI have been held and that the forums will also include labor and civil rights leaders, national security experts and academics.

                              <span>Criminal gangs behind a rise in bombings and shootings in Sweden in recent years are using fake Spotify streams to launder money, a Swedish newspaper reported earlier this month. From a report: Criminal networks have for several years been using money from drug deals, robberies, fraud and contract killings to pay for false Spotify streams of songs published by artists with ties to the gangs, an investigative report in Svenska Dagbladet claimed. They then get paid by the platform for the high number of streams, thereby laundering the money. The newspaper said its information had been confirmed by four gang members from separate criminal networks in Stockholm, as well as an anonymous police investigator.

                              <span>AmiMoJo writes: France has ordered Apple to stop selling the iPhone 12 for emitting too much electromagnetic radiation. On Tuesday, the French watchdog which governs radio frequencies also told the tech giant to fix existing phones. The ANFR has advised Apple that if it cannot resolve the issue via a software update, it must recall every iPhone 12 ever sold in the country. France&#x27;s digital minister Jean-Noel Barrot told French newspaper Le Parisien the decision was due to radiation levels above the acceptable threshold, according to Reuters. He said the ANFR found the iPhone 12&#x27;s Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) was above what is legally allowed. &quot;Apple is expected to respond within two weeks,&quot; he said. &quot;If they fail to do so, I am prepared to order a recall of all iPhones 12 in circulation. The rule is the same for everyone, including the digital giants.&quot;

                              <span>Sony is rolling out a big new PS5 update today, just over a month after it first started testing the changes in a beta. From a report: The update adds Dolby Atmos, lets you mute that annoying bootup beep, and even supports pairing a second controller as an assist one to let you help friends or family complete a game. Sony is also expanding its PS Remote Play app to Google&#x27;s Chromecast with Google TV (4K), allowing you to stream games from a PS5 or PS4 to Android TV OS 12 devices. The Dolby Atmos support comes in the form of Sony&#x27;s 3D Audio implementation (Tempest 3D AudioTech). It&#x27;s compatible with Dolby Atmos devices like sound bars, TVs, or home theater systems. Media apps like Netflix can also update their apps on PS5 soon to support Dolby Atmos audio. 

You can now mute the PS5 beep sound that chirps when you turn the console on or off, or even when it goes into rest mode after being idle. If you just want to adjust the volume of the beep there&#x27;s now an option for that, too. One of the most useful additions is the ability to use a second DualSense controller for assistance. &quot;You can now assign a second controller to one account as an assist controller, and use two controllers to operate your PS5 console as if you were using a single controller,&quot; explains Hideaki Nishino, senior vice president of platform experience at Sony Interactive Entertainment. &quot;This feature introduces a new way for you to enjoy games collaboratively with others or help a friend or child navigate a particularly challenging section of a game.&quot;

                              <span>Mozilla has released emergency security updates to fix a critical zero-day vulnerability exploited in the wild, impacting its Firefox web browser and Thunderbird email client. From a report: Tracked as CVE-2023-4863, the security flaw is caused by a heap buffer overflow in the WebP code library (libwebp), whose impact spans from crashes to arbitrary code execution. &quot;Opening a malicious WebP image could lead to a heap buffer overflow in the content process. We are aware of this issue being exploited in other products in the wild,&quot; Mozilla said in an advisory published on Tuesday. Mozilla addressed the exploited zero-day in Firefox 117.0.1, Firefox ESR 115.2.1, Firefox ESR 102.15.1, Thunderbird 102.15.1, and Thunderbird 115.2.2. Even though specific details regarding the WebP flaw&#x27;s exploitation in attacks remain undisclosed, this critical vulnerability is being abused in real-world scenarios.

                              <span>The ring/silent switch has been on the iPhone since the very first one was announced in 2007 by Steve Jobs, but now the writing is on the wall for the device&#x27;s last significant moving part. From a report: With its replacement by a haptic &quot;action button,&quot; it&#x27;s just a matter of time before the rest of the lineup is as smooth as a pebble from the river. At today&#x27;s iPhone event, the no doubt long-contemplated change was announced with little fanfare, selling the new button as a customizable shortcut to anything the user wants. Launch the camera, or an assistance feature, or a particular app, etc. Seems useful in some ways, especially for accessibility. But I mourn the loss of this switch the way I do every time they compromise the hardware design of Apple devices. Removing TouchID is one such choice I still hold out hope they will reverse. The haptic touchpads in MacBooks is not something I enjoy compared to the actual depression of the originals, though it&#x27;s probably a net benefit repair-wise. The attempt to unify under a single port was unsuccessful in everything but driving dongle sales. They have tried and failed to kill the magnetic power connector.

                              <span>The cofounder and main promoter of the $4 billion OneCoin pyramid scheme was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in one of the first and biggest criminal frauds involving cryptocurrency. Bloomberg: Karl Sebastian Greenwood, 46, was sentenced in New York Tuesday, after pleading guilty in December to creating and promoting a phony cryptocurrency. Greenwood was the wingman of Ruja Ignatova, the so-called &quot;Cryptoqueen&quot; and most wanted crypto fugitive in the world. US District Judge Edgardo Ramos called the fraud &quot;massive in many respects,&quot; noting that OneCoin had no blockchain, no real cryptocoin and no trading market. Victims could not withdraw their investments and most face the likelihood they&#x27;ll never get any of their money back. &quot;At base, it involved nothing more than old-fashioned snake oil,&quot; the judge said. Greenwoood&#x27;s sentencing closes one chapter of the OneCoin case, which authorities describe as one of the largest pyramid schemes in history. It impacted 3.5 million victims across the globe and foreshadowed a broader crackdown on crime in the cryptocurrency markets.

                              <span>Companies choose Alphabet&#x27;s Google as the default search engine for their browsers and smartphones because it is the best one, and not because of a lack of competition, a Google lawyer said Tuesday at the start of a high-stakes antitrust trial in Washington. From a report: Consumers use Google &quot;because it delivers value to them, not because they have to,&quot; John Schmidtlein, a partner at Williams &amp; Connolly LLP who is representing the company, said during his opening statements on the first day of the trial. &quot;Users today have more search options and ways to access information online than ever before.&quot; 

Schmidtlein pushed back on claims by US Justice Department antitrust enforcers that Google has used its market power -- and billions of dollars in exclusive deals with web browsers -- to illegally block rivals. Users have choices, and it&#x27;s easy to switch, he said. For example, Microsoft pre-selects its own search engine, Bing, on Windows PCs, yet most PC users switch to Google because it&#x27;s a better product, he said. Web browsers offered by Apple and Mozilla, which makes Firefox, have long chosen a default search engine in exchange for a revenue-share that helps pay for innovations, Schmidtlein said.

                              <span>Apple just announced its new high-end iPhones: the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. The Verge: They&#x27;re made of titanium, they have Action Buttons, and Apple promises they&#x27;re the most powerful smartphones Apple has ever made. The 15 Pro starts at $999 with 128GB of storage, and the Pro Max at $1,199 with 256GB of storage. Both will be available for preorder this Friday and on sale September 22nd. This year&#x27;s Pro has a 6.1-inch screen, and the Pro Max has a 6.7-inch display -- same as the new iPhone 15 and 15 Plus. Both are powered by the A17 Pro chip, which Apple says has the fastest performance in any smartphone and can even challenge some high-end PCs. Along with a redesigned GPU, Apple seems to think these devices could be poised to level up the kinds of games you can play on your phone.

                              <span>Inditex is racing to iron bugs out of a new anti-shoplifting system for its Zara stores, slightly delaying its rollout partly because the security tags were easy to identify and remove in initial tests, Bloomberg reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. From the report: Chief Executive Officer Oscar Garcia Maceiras unveiled the new technology in March and pledged to roll it out for tests in all Zara stores worldwide over the summer. The system relies on tiny chips known as RFID, doing away with the hard plastic tags on garments that require checkout clerks to remove them. The new technology has run into teething issues. Staff in several countries have raised concerns to management that the technology may actually make theft easier, according to the people, who asked not to be identified.

                              <span>Apple has just announced the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, and the big news is a USB-C port. From a report: We&#x27;ve been waiting for the day that the iPhone would switch to the widely used USB-C standard instead of Apple&#x27;s proprietary Lightning connector. Apple confirmed last year that it would make the change to USB-C to comply with the European Union&#x27;s upcoming regulations, and the iPhone 15 is now the first iPhone to make the switch. The iPhone 15 is priced starting at $799 for a 128GB model and the iPhone 15 Plus starts at $899 for a 128GB version. 

USB-C is good news, but if you were hoping for a totally new iPhone 15 design, well, that&#x27;s not happening this year. This year&#x27;s iPhone looks largely the same as the iPhone 14 before it, with the iPhone 15 continuing to use a 6.1-inch display. All models of the iPhone 15 will come with the Dynamic Island. That&#x27;s the pill-shaped cutout that first debuted on the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max, providing a new way to see certain notifications and interact with apps. The iPhone 15 also has an OLED Super Retina display, which supports Dolby Vision content with 1,600 nits of brightness. The peak brightness of this display is 2,000 nits in sunlight, double that of the iPhone 14.

                              <span>The World Bank poured billions of dollars into fossil fuels around the world last year despite repeated promises to refocus on shifting to a low-carbon economy, research has suggested. From a report: The money went through a special form of funding known as trade finance, which is used to facilitate global transactions. Urgewald, a campaign group that tracks global fossil fuel finance, found that the World Bank supplied about $3.7bn in trade finance in 2022 that was likely to have ended up funding oil and gas developments. 

Heike Mainhardt, the author of the research, called for reform of the World Bank and its private finance arm, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), to make such transactions more transparent and to exclude funding for fossil fuels from its lending. &quot;They can&#x27;t say that they are aligned with the Paris agreement, because there isn&#x27;t enough transparency to be able to tell,&quot; she said. Fossil fuel companies would take advantage of this, she added. &quot;They can see that they can access public money this way, without drawing attention to themselves, and they&#x27;re very clever, so they will do this,&quot; she told the Guardian. Trade finance is a form of funding more opaque than standard project finance. Whereas project finance usually flows to governments, organisations or consortiums for a particular well-defined purpose and is relatively easy to track, trade finance is more diffuse.

                              <span>Major corporations from oil and gas companies to retail giants would have to disclose their direct greenhouse gas emissions as well as those that come from activities like employee business travel under legislation passed Monday by California lawmakers, the most sweeping mandate of its kind in the nation. From a report: The legislation would require thousands of public and private businesses that operate in California and make more than $1 billion annually to report their direct and indirect emissions. The goal is to increase transparency and nudge companies to evaluate how they can cut their emissions. &quot;We are out of time on addressing the climate crisis,&quot; Democratic Assemblymember Chris Ward said. &quot;This will absolutely help us take a leap forward to be able to hold ourselves accountable.&quot; 

The legislation was one of the highest profile climate bills in California this year, racking support from major companies that include Patagonia and Apple, as well as Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the United Nations convention behind the 2015 Paris climate agreement. The bill would still need final approval by the state Senate before it can reach Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom. Lawmakers backing the bill say a large number of companies in the state already disclose some of their own emissions. But the bill is a controversial proposal that many other businesses and groups in the state oppose and say will be too burdensome.

                              <span>Alphabet&#x27;s Google pays more than $10 billion a year to maintain its position as the default search engine on web browsers and mobile devices, stifling competition, the US Justice Department said Tuesday at the start of a high-stakes antitrust trial in Washington. From a report: &quot;This case is about the future of the internet and whether Google&#x27;s search engine will ever face meaningful competition,&quot; Kenneth Dintzer, a government lawyer, said in his opening statement. &quot;The evidence will show they demanded default exclusivity to block rivals.&quot; Dintzer said Google became a monopoly by at least 2010 and today controls more than 89% of the online search market. 

&quot;The company pays billions for defaults because they are uniquely powerful,&quot; he said. &quot;For the last 12 years, Google has abused its monopoly in general search.&quot; The monopolization trial is the first pitting the federal government against a US technology company in more than two decades. The Justice Department and 52 attorneys general from states and US territories allege Google illegally maintained its monopoly by paying billions to tech rivals, smartphone makers and wireless providers in exchange for being set as the preselected option or default on mobile phones and web browsers.

                              <span>An artificial intelligence benchmark group called MLCommons unveiled the results on Monday of new tests that determine how quickly top-of-the-line hardware can run AI models. From a report: A Nvidia chip was the top performer in tests on a large language model, with a semiconductor produced by Intel a close second. The new MLPerf benchmark is based on a large language model with 6 billion parameters that summarizes CNN news articles. The benchmark simulates the &quot;inference&quot; portion of AI data crunching, which powers the software behind generative AI tools. 

Nvidia&#x27;s top submission for the inference benchmark build around eight of its flagship H100 chips. Nvidia has dominated the market for training AI models, but hasn&#x27;t captured the inference market yet. &quot;What you see is that we&#x27;re delivering leadership performance across the board, and again, delivering that leadership performance on all workloads,&quot; Nvidia&#x27;s accelerated computing marketing director, Dave Salvator, said. Intel&#x27;s success is based around its Gaudi2 chips produced by the Habana unit the company acquired in 2019. The Gaudi2 system was roughly 10% slower than Nvidia&#x27;s system.

                              <span>Credit card disputes at Visa continued rising past their pandemic boom despite the proliferation of prevention software, as fraud grows alongside e-commerce and inflation. From a report: Disputes on Visa&#x27;s network rose to more than 90 million in 2022, data provided by the payment company showed. More than 70 million disputes were filed in 2019, Visa said in a presentation, before rising 24% in 2020 during the pandemic and about 2% a year in 2021 and 2022. 

Despite being easy for consumers to file, making it one of the most-common credit card frauds, disputes are an opaque part of the payments industry. Both Mastercard Inc. and American Express declined to provide disputes data. Visa and Mastercard both bought dispute prevention companies in 2019, Verifi and Ethoca, respectively, and regularly promote their offerings at conferences. Disputes can be costly and onerous for both credit card companies and merchants to process, while chargebacks, when a dispute results in a refund, cost merchants dearly -- about $2.40 for every dollar disputed, according to Visa&#x27;s Verifi, or as high as $3.36 for every dollar, according to Mastercard&#x27;s Ethoca.

                              <span>A WhatsApp for Android beta update (version 2.23.19.8) that came out today contains a new screen called Third-party chats, reports WABetaInfo. The Verge: For now, the screen is neither functional nor accessible by users, according to WABetaInfo. But its title is a strong clue that this is likely the first step to opening Meta&#x27;s encrypted messages app to cross-platform compatibility. The beta comes just days after the European Commission confirmed that WhatsApp owner Meta meets the definition of a &quot;gatekeeper&quot; under the EU&#x27;s Digital Markets Act (DMA), which requires communication software like WhatsApp to interoperate with third-party messaging apps by March 2024.

                              <span>There&#x27;s nothing complicated about company culture.


Culture simply happens. It&#x27;s emergent behavior. There&#x27;s nothing to do, it just is.


A company&#x27;s culture is a 50-day moving average. It&#x27;s what you&#x27;ve been collectively doing as a company over the last 50 days.


How do you treat people? Who have you hired (or fired) and why? What do you when people are stressed out? How do you help people? How do you critique each other? How do you share? How do you help people who are stuck? Where&#x27;s the bar on quality? How do you support customers? How do you close deals? What have you let go on too long? What have you celebrated? What have you let slide? How honest have you been with each other and yourself.


It&#x27;s all that and a zillion other things. But it&#x27;s all stuff that actually happened, it&#x27;s not lists of things you wish had happened, or declared would happen in some ideal setting. Much of it is interpersonal, expressed both inside and outside the organization.


Why 50 days? It&#x27;s enough time for patterns to emerge, yet malleable enough to be current and honest. One day, or even a couple weeks, isn&#x27;t enough to stand for culture. A series of moments tied together loosely by near-term time just isn&#x27;t enough to establish what it&#x27;s really like somewhere. We can all be on our best behavior for a little while, but the longer while tells the truth.


Culture is the non-fiction story of an organization. It writes itself.

                              <span>Lockheed Martin may see more than $800 million in payments withheld through next June until it wins approval for the software powering its most advanced version of the F-35, according to newly disclosed delivery figures. From a report: The No. 1 US defense contractor is on tap to finish production of about 52 of the upgraded TR-3 model fighter jets by Dec. 31 and approximately 12 per month after that, or 72 more by June 30, for as many as 124 jets, according to the data released Monday by Russ Goemaere, the Pentagon&#x27;s spokesman on the F-35. 

The Pentagon is withholding $7 million per aircraft until the new software is validated because the aircraft are being placed in storage until then. At 124 jets, that&#x27;s $868 million. Last month, the Defense Department withheld $7 million on each of the first four upgraded F-35s. The aircraft needs the delay-plagued software upgrade to function fully with new cockpit hardware before it can carry more precise weapons and gather more information on enemy aircraft and air defenses. The upgrade will increase processing power 37 times and memory 20 times over the F-35&#x27;s current capabilities.

                              <span>Grocery delivery app Instacart set a target valuation that was way below its prior funding round in 2021, a sign of companies treading carefully as they test investor appetite for new listings. From a report: The San-Francisco based firm said Monday it&#x27;s pricing its shares between $26 and $28 per share. Instacart said it has 279 million shares outstanding as of Aug. 15. Including the stock options and the restricted stock units of 20.45 million and 31.47 million, respectively, the total stock for the purpose of valuing the company comes to 331 million shares. This makes for a valuation between $8.6 billion to $9.3 billion, far below its valuation of $39 billion set in a fundraising round in 2021. The company&#x27;s internal valuation last year in March was $24 billion, and in July was reduced to $15 billion to reflect the selloff in technology stocks, a person familiar with the matter had told Barron&#x27;s.

                              <span>The European Union has lowered its forecast for economic growth this year and next, saying inflation is taking a heavy toll on people&#x27;s willingness to spend in shops -- while higher interest rates are sharply restricting the credit needed for investment and purchases. From a report: The revised forecast Monday from the European Commission, the EU&#x27;s executive arm, comes as fears of recession grow and as the European Central Bank faces a key decision this week on whether to keep raising rates, which are aimed at getting inflation under control. The 20 countries that use the euro currency are expected to see growth of 0.8% this year instead of 1.1% projected in the spring forecast, the commission said. For next year, growth expectations were lowered to 1.3% from 1.6%. For the broader 27-country EU, the forecast also was lowered to 0.8% from 1% this year and to 1.4% from 1.7% next year. 

&quot;Weakness in domestic demand, in particular consumption, shows that high and still increasing consumer prices for most goods and services are taking a heavier toll than expected,&quot; a commission statement said. EU Economy Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said at a news conference that &quot;further weakening in the coming months&quot; was foreseen as the economy faces &quot;multiple headwinds.&quot; One source of uncertainty is how far the ECB will go on interest rates -- more expensive credit restrains economic growth in some areas such as real estate, but if higher rates succeed in lowering inflation, that would boost consumer spending power.

                              <span>Microsoft has made it clear: it will ax third-party printer drivers in Windows. From a report: The death rattle will be lengthy, as the timeline for the end of servicing stretches into 2027 -- although Microsoft noted that the dates will be subject to change. There is, after all, always that important customer with a strange old printer lacking Mopria support. 

Mopria is part of the Windows&#x27; teams justification for removing support. Founded in 2013 by Canon, HP, Samsung and Xerox, the Mopria Alliance&#x27;s mission is to provide universal standards for printing and scanning. Epson, Lexmark, Adobe and Microsoft have also joined the gang since then. Since Windows 10 21H2, Microsoft has baked Mopria support into the flagship operating system, with support for devices connected via the network or USB, thanks to the Microsoft IPP Class driver. Microsoft said: &quot;This removes the need for print device manufacturers to provide their own installers, drivers, utilities, and so on.&quot;

                              <span>The U.S. Copyright Office has again rejected copyright protection for art created using artificial intelligence, denying a request by artist Jason M. Allen for a copyright covering an award-winning image he created with the generative AI system Midjourney. From a report: The office said on Tuesday that Allen&#x27;s science-fiction themed image &quot;Theatre D&#x27;opera Spatial&quot; was not entitled to copyright protection because it was not the product of human authorship. The Copyright Office in February rescinded copyrights for images that artist Kris Kashtanova created using Midjourney for a graphic novel called &quot;Zarya of the Dawn,&quot; dismissing the argument that the images showed Kashtanova&#x27;s own creative expression. 

It has also rejected a copyright for an image that computer scientist Stephen Thaler said his AI system created autonomously. Allen said on Wednesday that the office&#x27;s decision on his work was expected, but he was &quot;certain we will win in the end.&quot; &quot;If this stands, it is going to create more problems than it solves,&quot; Allen said. &quot;This is going to create new and creative problems for the copyright office in ways we can&#x27;t even speculate yet.&quot;

                              <span>Microsoft is done supporting the original Surface Duo, three years after it first launched on September 10. From a report: The company has stated from the very start that the Surface Duo would receive just three years of OS updates, meaning today is the last day that Microsoft has to stay true to its word. Going forward, Microsoft will no longer ship new OS updates or security patches for the original Surface Duo, meaning Android 12L is the last version of the OS it will ever officially receive. Surface Duo only ever got two major OS updates, one shy of the average three that most high-end flagship Android devices get these days.

                              <span>Slash_Account_Dot shares a report: The FBI had a problem. In 2019 the agency was secretly running an encrypted phone company called Anom. Serious organized criminals were using the phones and Anom was gaining popularity. But even though Anom contained a backdoor -- a chunk of code that silently copied every message sent -- the FBI was unable to actually read Anom&#x27;s messages. The FBI had not obtained legal approval to rummage through that treasure trove of intelligence. 

[...] So the agency turned to what court records have described as a &quot;third country,&quot; the first country being America and the second being Australia, which ran a beta test of the Anom surveillance operation. The third country allowed the FBI to overcome this legal hurdle. The country hosted the Anom interception server for the FBI, and then provided Anom&#x27;s messages to American authorities every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. That country &quot;requested its participation be kept confidential,&quot; according to a document I previously obtained. The document said the third country was a European Union member but did not name the country itself. &quot;The FBI is neither now nor in the future in a position to release the identity of the aforementioned third country,&quot; the document added.

From a report: In an interview Wired published Monday, the Google CEO said the company worked &quot;deeply&quot; with Nvidia on Android and other initiatives for over a decade, adding that Nvidia has a &quot;strong track record&quot; with AI innovation. &quot;Look, the semiconductor industry is a very dynamic, cooperative industry,&quot; Pichai said. &quot;It&#x27;s an industry that needs deep, long-term R&amp;D and investments. I feel comfortable about our relationship with Nvidia and that we are going to be working closely with them 10 years from now.&quot;

                              <span>Apple is extending an agreement to get modem semiconductors from Qualcomm for three more years, a sign that its ambitious effort to design the chips in-house is taking longer than expected. From a report: The new pact will cover &quot;smartphone launches in 2024, 2025 and 2026,&quot; Qualcomm said in a statement Monday. The companies&#x27; agreement had been set to end this year, and the latest iPhone -- due on Tuesday -- was expected to be one of the last to rely on the Qualcomm modem chip. Instead, Qualcomm will maintain its lucrative position within Apple&#x27;s supply chain. The iPhone maker is Qualcomm&#x27;s largest customer -- accounting for nearly a quarter of revenue, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. And their relationship helps validate Qualcomm&#x27;s claim to having the best smartphone modem, a critical component that allows devices to connect to the internet and make calls. Starting with the iPhone 12 generation, the chip has supported speedier 5G networks.

                              <span>An anonymous Slashdot reader shared this report from the New York Times:

The collapse in cryptocurrency prices last year forced a procession of major firms into bankruptcy, triggering a government crackdown and erasing the savings of millions of inexperienced investors. But for a small group of corporate turnaround specialists, crypto&#x27;s implosion has become a financial bonanza. 

Lawyers, accountants, consultants, cryptocurrency analysts and other professionals have racked up more than $700 million in fees since last year from the bankruptcies of five major crypto firms, including the digital currency exchange FTX, according to a New York Times analysis of court records. That sum is likely to grow significantly as the cases unfold over the coming months.
Large fees are common in corporate bankruptcies, which require complex and time-intensive legal work to untangle. But in the crypto world, the mounting fees have sparked widespread outrage because many of the people owed money are amateur traders who lost their personal savings, rather than corporations with the ability to weather a financial crisis. Every dollar in fees is deducted from the pool of funds that will be returned to creditors at the end of the bankruptcies. 

The fees are &quot;exorbitant and ridiculous,&quot; said Daniel Frishberg, a 19-year-old investor who lost about $3,000 when the crypto company Celsius Network filed for bankruptcy last year. &quot;At every hearing, they have an army of people there, and most of them don&#x27;t need to be there. You don&#x27;t need 20 people taking notes.&quot;

                              <span>Last week IEEE Spectrum released its 10th annual rankings of the Top Programming Languages.
It choose a top language for each of three categories: 	actively used among typical IEEE members and working software engineers, in demand by employers, or &quot;in the zeitgeist&quot;. 


The results?

This year, Python doesn&#x27;t just remain No. 1 in our general &quot;Spectrum&quot; ranking — which is weighted to reflect the interests of the typical IEEE member — but it widens its lead. 

Python&#x27;s increased dominance appears to be largely at the expense of smaller, more specialized, languages. It has become the jack-of-all-trades language — and the master of some, such as AI, where powerful and extensive libraries make it ubiquitous. And although Moore&#x27;s Law is winding down for high-end computing, low-end microcontrolle…</span>

                              <span>Earlier this year, Singapore-based embedded security researcher yeokm1 built a ChatGPT client for MS-DOS. 
Now they&#x27;re back with a new project:
HDMI is a relatively modern video connector we take for granted on modern PCs and monitors. Now vintage PCs can join in the fun too with a native connection to modern HDMI monitors without any additional adapter. 

Two years ago, I learned of an open-source project called Graphics Gremlin by Eric Schlaepfer who runs the website Tubetime.us. It is an 8-bit ISA graphics card that supports display standards like Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) and Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA). CGA and MDA are display standards used by older IBM(-compatible) PCs in the 1980s. The frequencies and connectors used by CGA and MDA are no longer supported by modern monitors hence it is difficult for older PCs of the 1980s era to have modern displays connected to them without external adapters. Graphics Gremline addresses this problem by using techniques like scan doubling (for CGA) and increasing the vertical refresh rate (for MDA) then outputing to a relatively newer but still old VGA port. 

I fabricated and assembled the design then installed it into my IBM5155... I decided to modify the Graphics Gremlin design so it can connect natively to an external HDMI monitor and service the internal Composite-based CRT at the same time. 

The post concludes triumphantly with a photo of their IBM 5155 running the CGA Compatibility Tester displaying the color palette.

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and Microsoft disclosed the breach in June, but it was still unclear at the time exactly how hackers were able to steal the key that allowed them to access the email accounts. Microsoft said the key …</span>

                              <span>When we first got our Tesla Model X four years ago, I wasn&#x27;t the biggest fan. Build quality was spotty, brakes didn&#x27;t match the performance, and handling was at best so-so. But it could carry seven, including luggage, was electric, and the dual-motor acceleration was a hoot. So it stayed in the garage, pending competition on these criteria. Well, now we got a Mercedes EQS SUV, which also carries seven, is electric, and is fun-fast for its size. But the Tesla still wins!
At least in judgement of the rest of the family. Their verdict was unanimous. The Tesla is &quot;less fuzzy&quot;, &quot;more fun&quot;, &quot;has games&quot;, and even is &quot;more comfortable&quot;. Now, personally, I appreciate the German build quality, prefer CarPlay over Tesla&#x27;s UI, and love the quieter cabin. But I&#x27;m clearly in the minority. Even though the Mercedes is considerably more money, and brand new, the rest of the family would rather keep the Tesla.
This is what the legacy car industry is up against. Most of its traditional virtues under attack by a huge portion of the market who just don&#x27;t give a damn. To whom the fact that, for example, Tesla has a sense of humor trumps the minor niggles it might still have compared to the legacy competition. It&#x27;s fascinating.
And even for people like yours truly, who absolutely do appreciate those traditional virtues, it&#x27;s becoming harder and harder to hate on Tesla. I mean look at the performance of the Plaid, with its 1,020 horsepower, and compare the fact that it&#x27;s now a mere $90,000. For a car that&#x27;ll beat a Bugatti Chiron, along with virtually every other car on the planet, in the quarter mile. That&#x27;s just ridiculous.
So the Model X is staying, and I&#x27;ve put down an order for a Model S Plaid. GG, Elon.</span>

                              <span>Business Insider reports on &quot;a soaring number of Gen Zers who has decided to skip college altogether. 

&quot;Four million fewer teenagers enrolled at a college in 2022 than in 2012.&quot;


 For many, the price tag has simply grown too exorbitant to justify the cost. From 2010 to 2022, college tuition rose an average of 12% a year, while overall inflation only increased an average of 2.6% each year. Today it costs at least $104,108 on average to attend four years of public university — and $223,360 for a private university. 


At the same time, the salaries students can expect to earn after graduation haven&#x27;t kept up with the cost of college. A 2019 report from the Pew Research Center found that earnings for young college-educated workers had remained mostly flat over the past 50 years. Four years …</span>

More from MarketWatch:

Citing jail records, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Sunday that a man identified as game developer Mikhail Olson, known by the nickname Simbuilder, was arrested by U.S. Park Police on suspicion of having a concealed firearm in his vehicle, along with armor-piercing ammunition and a large-capacity magazine.

 
The awards ceremony was held at Fort Mason Center, which is on federal property. According to the Chronicle, the suspect was arrested Saturday afternoon after allegedly assaulting U.S. Park Police officers who had been called over a report of a disturbance outside the Roblox conference.

The cost of building an artificial intelligence product like ChatGPT can be hard to measure. But one thing Microsoft-backed OpenAI needed for its technology was plenty of water, pulled from the watershed of the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers in central Iowa to cool a powerful supercomputer as it helped teach its AI systems how to mimic human writing. 

 As they race to capitalize on a craze for generative AI, leading tech developers including Microsoft, OpenAI and Google have acknowledged that growing demand for their AI tools carries hefty costs, from expensive semiconductors to an increase in water consumption. But they&#x27;re often secretive about the specifics. Few people in Iowa knew about its status as a birthplac…</span>

                              <span>One year ago NASA crashed its DART spacecraft into the asteroid &quot;Dimorphos&quot; (which orbits around a much larger asteroid named &quot;Didymos&quot;). The BBC calls the mission &quot;part of an experiment to change the space rock&#x27;s direction and test Earth&#x27;s defences against asteroids in the future. 

&quot;However, a teacher and his class studying the rock have now discovered that since the collision, it has moved in a strange and unexpected way.&quot;
[U]sing their school telescope, a team of children and their teacher Jonathan Swift at Thacher School in California have found that more than a month after the collision, Dimorphos&#x27; orbit continuously slowed after impact... which is unusual and unexpected. As reported in the New Scientist, the team presented their findings at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society. 

After discovering the unusual behaviour of Dimorphos, it&#x27;s likely that Nasa will have to factor in the high school&#x27;s findings, if they ever launch another asteroid redirection mission in the future...

One explanation for the asteroid&#x27;s orbit continuing to change so long after the Dart collision is that material thrown up by the impact, including rocks several metres across, eventually fell back onto the surface of the asteroid, changing its orbit even more. The European Space Agency is launching a mission called Hera, which will arrive at Dimorphos in 2026 and could reveal more details as to what happened to the asteroid following the impact.

After the great Reddit protests, all three were removed from their positions. But now Ars Technica asks whether Reddit&#x27;s replacement moderators will be as capable of spotting dangerous advice?
In response to concerns that the new r/homeautomation mod team could overlook posts with dangerous misinformation, one moderator requesting anonymity pointed me to the subreddit&#x27;s sidebar, which has a disclaimer about the dangers of electricity.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this report from InfoWorld:
The uses of WebAssembly, aka Wasm, have grown far beyond its initial target of web applications, according to The State of WebAssembly 2023 report. But some developers remain skeptical.

Released September 6 by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and SlashData, in collaboration with the Linux Foundation, the report finds mostly optimism among software developers about future adoption of Wasm for web and non-web environments... However, about 22% of participants in the report indicated pessimism about Wasm adoption for either the web or non-web environments. Further, 83% of the respondents reported challenges with Wasm including difficulties with debugging and troubleshooting, different performance between runtimes, lack of consistent developer experiences between runtimes, lack of learning materials, and compatibility issues with certain browsers. 

The report finds that respondents are using WebAssembly across a wide range of software projects including data visualization (35%), internet of things (32%, artificial intelligence (30%), games (28%), back-end services (27%), edge computing (25%), and more. While Wasm is still primarily used to develop web applications (58%), this is changing thanks to WASI (WebAssembly System Interface), which provides a modular interface for Wasm... 

Other findings of the State of WebAssembly 2023 report: 
- When migrating existing applications to Wasm, 30% of respondents experience performance benefits of more than 50%.
- JavaScript is the most popular language used with Wasm applications. But Rust stands out in popularity in Wasm projects compared to other use cases...
 

The article says WebAssembly developers were attracted by &quot;faster loading times, the ability to explore new use cases and technologies, and the ability to share code between projects. Improved performance over JavaScript and efficient execution of computationally intensive tasks also were cited.&quot;

                              <span>CNN reports:

The first experiment to produce oxygen on another planet has come to an end on Mars after exceeding NASA&#x27;s initial goals and demonstrating capabilities that could help future astronauts explore the red planet. The microwave-size device called MOXIE, or Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment, is on the Perseverance rover. 

The experiment kicked off more than two years ago, a few months after the rover landed on Mars. Since then, MOXIE has generated 122 grams of oxygen, equal to what a small dog breathes in 10 hours, according to NASA. The instrument works by converting some of Mars&#x27; plentiful carbon dioxide into oxygen. During the peak of its efficiency, MOXIE produced 12 grams of oxygen an hour at 98% purity or better, which is twice as much as NASA&#x27;s goals for the instrument. On August 7, MOXIE operated for the 16th and final time, having completed all its requirements...



Bigger and better versions of something such as MOXIE in the future could supply life support systems with breathable air and convert and store oxygen needed for rocket fuel used to launch on a return trip to Earth. 

In a statement NASA applauded the performance of the MIT-created experiment. &quot;When the first astronauts land on Mars, they may have the descendants of a microwave-oven-size device to thank for the air they breathe and the rocket propellant that gets them home... 

&quot;Rather than bringing large quantities of oxygen with them to Mars, future astronauts could live off the land, using materials they find on the planet&#x27;s surface to survive.&quot;

On that day a small protest was held outside Cruise&#x27;s headquarters in San Francisco — featuring taxi drivers and mass transit workers. 

CBS News spoke to Edward Escobar, a Bay Area Uber driver and director of the Alliance for Independent Workers. They report that Escobar orchestrated the protest &quot;to convey their concerns about the potential impact of robotaxis on their jobs.

&quot;There isn&#x27;t any dialogue happening. It&#x27;s pretty much one-sided. It&#x27;s being dictated by the tech titans, Waymo, which is Google, and General Motors, which is Cruise,&quot; Escobar said. &quot;And they&#x27;re pretty much dictating the terms, and the California Public Utilities Commission is allowin…</span>

 If realized, Eos Energy&#x27;s utility- and industrial-scale zinc-bromine battery energy storage system could provide cheaper, vastly more sustainable options for the country&#x27;s burgeoning renewable power infrastructure... Unlike lithium-ion and lithium iron phosphate batteries, alternatives such as the Eos Z3 design rely on zinc-based cathodes alongside a water-based electrolyte, notes MIT Technology Review. This important distinction both increases their stability, as well as makes it incredibly difficult for them to support combustion. Zinc-bromine batteries meanwhi…</span>

                              <span>Star Trek: The Animated Series was a half-hour Saturday morning cartoon that premiered exactly one half century ago — yesterday. You can watch its opening credits sequence on YouTube — with its strange 1970s version of the theme song. CBS&#x27;s YouTube channel also offers clips from various episodes. 

Starting in 1973, it ran for two seasons — a total of just 22 episodes. But the BBC notes it kept Star Trek in people&#x27;s minds after the original series had been cancelled in 1969:

While The Original Series had struggled in the ratings during its initial run, the show thrived in syndication, and created the phenomenon of fan conventions (think Comic-con in the present day). Because of this, studios were interested in more Star Trek, but there was a problem: the sets had been scrapped, the costum…</span>

                              <span>Localhost is the inevitable victim of every software’s commercial success.
Assume you’re a fintech running a Ruby on Rails monolith. If you ever get to PMF, you’ll inevitably have to scale to process more transactions, or you’ll have to hire more engineers to build ancillary features.
When that happens, you’ll have to break your monolith into microservices so it scales more efficiently or so that multiple teams can deploy software without stepping on each other’s toes.
Or someone in your company may have gone to too many AWS conferences and may want to sprinkle some lambdas here and there. “It’s scalable”, they’ll say.
As that happens, there will be a point of no return in which engineers can’t run the whole system on their machines anymore — at least not in a reliable way.

“People always asked me why I was smiling. Other guys had a sour face or they were pissed off that they had to do another rep or another set. But I looked forward to the work. Why? Because I knew that with every rep that I did, every set that I did, with every weight that I lifted, I got one step closer to turning my vision into reality.”
This is not how most people approach achievement. We get discouraged, are inconsistent, and let our own plans fall through. We get frustrated, punish, and guilt ourselves into trudging forward.
It doesn&#x27;t get better even if we achieve our goals. There’s a brief respite after crossing the finish line — but once we inevitably set a new goal, we’re running towards yet another finish line and beating o…</span>

                              <span>&quot;12 people account for the lion&#x27;s share of anti-vaccination propaganda posted to three of the leading social media outlets,&quot; NPR reported in 2021, citing a study from a London-based group opposed to online hate and disinformation.&quot; 

But this week Ars Technica reports that one of those 12 &quot;lost a lawsuit attempting to force YouTube to provide access to videos that were removed from the platform after YouTube banned his channels.&quot;

Joseph Mercola had tried to argue that YouTube owed him more than $75,000 in damages for breaching its own user contract and denying him access to his videos. However, in an order dismissing Mercola&#x27;s complaint, U.S. magistrate judge Laurel Beeler wrote that according to the contract Mercola signed, YouTube was &quot;under no obligation to host&quot; Mercola&#x27;s content after terminating his channel in 2021 &quot;for violating YouTube&#x27;s Community Guidelines by posting medical misinformation about COVID-19 and vaccines.&quot; 

&quot;The court found no breach because &#x27;there is no provision in the Terms of Service that requires YouTube to maintain particular content&#x27; or be a &#x27;storage site for users&#x27; content,&#x27;&quot; Beeler wrote. Because Mercola&#x27;s contract with YouTube was found to be enforceable and &quot;YouTube had the discretion to take down content that harmed its users,&quot; Beeler said that Mercola did not plausibly plead claims for breach of contract or unjust enrichment. 

Mercola&#x27;s complaint was dismissed without leave to amend.

Now the U.S. government &quot;plans to fix that by crisscrossing the reservation with fiber-optic cable — at an average cost of $53,000 for each household and workplace connected.&quot; 
While that amount exceeds the assessed value of some of the 658 homes getting hookups — at a cost of $35.2 million — &quot;the tribe is also starting an internet company to run the network, creating jobs and competing with an existing provider known for slow customer service.&quot;

                              <span>The Washington Post reports:
 Japan launched a lunar mission Thursday, overcoming multiple failures and delays to become the fifth country to head to the moon — just weeks after India — in a global race to better understand Earth&#x27;s closest neighbor... It is scheduled to enter the moon&#x27;s orbit in three to four months and land early next year. 


The rocket is carrying two space missions: a new X-ray telescope to help scientists better understand the origins of the universe and a lightweight high-precision moon lander that will serve as the basis for future moon landing technology. The telescope separated at 8:56 a.m., and the moon lander separated at 9:29 a.m... 

Japan has made several attempts to reach the moon, including its Omotenashi project to land an ultrasmall probe. In November, Japan abandoned the project after failing to restore communications with the spacecraft. Earlier this year, Tokyo-based space company ispace also pulled the plug on the first Japanese private-sector attempt to land on the moon. 
Japan&#x27;s high-precision lander hopes to land within 328 feet (100 meters) of its target — which the article says it &quot;much closer than conventional lunar landers, which usually have an accuracy of several kilometers.&quot;

                              <span>Huawei&#x27;s launch last week of the Mate 60 Pro smartphone &quot;shocked industry experts,&quot; reports CNN, who didn&#x27;t understand how Huawei &quot;would have the ability to manufacture such an advanced smartphone following sweeping efforts by the United States to restrict China&#x27;s access to foreign chip technology.&quot; 

And in a related note, CNN adds that South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix &quot;is investigating how two of its memory chips mysteriously ended up inside the Mate 60 Pro, a controversial smartphone launched by Huawei last week.&quot;

Shares in Hynix fell more than 4% on Friday after it emerged that two of its products, a 12 gigabyte (GB) LPDDR5 chip and 512 GB NAND flash memory chip, were found inside the Huawei handset by TechInsights, a research organization based in Canada specializing in semiconductors, which took the phone apart for analysis. &quot;The significance of the development is that there are restrictions on what SK Hynix can ship to China,&quot; G Dan Hutcheson, vice chair of TechInsights, told CNN. &quot;Where do these chips come from? The big question is whether any laws were violated.&quot; 

 A Hynix spokesperson told CNN Friday that it was aware of its chips being used in the Huawei phone and had started investigating the issue. 

The company &quot;no longer does business with Huawei since the introduction of the U.S. restrictions against the company,&quot; it said in a statement... Industry insiders said it was possible that Huawei had purchased the memory chips from the secondary market and not directly from the manufacturer. It&#x27;s also possible Huawei may have had a stockpile of components accumulated before the U.S. export curbs kicked in fully.

                              <span>A United Nations report &quot;says that overreliance on remote learning technology during the pandemic led to &#x27;staggering&#x27; education inequality around the world,&quot; reports the New York Times. The 655-page report from the United Nations&#x27; education/culture agency UNESCO asks if we&#x27;ve just experienced a worldwide &quot;ed-tech tragedy.&quot; 

Long-time Slashdot reader theodp writes:
Some of the main findings of the report include: 
 1. The promise of education technology was overstated
2. Remote online learning worsened education disparities
3. Learning was hindered and altered
4. Regulation and guardrails are needed. 

Remember that the report covers countries around the world, with different levels of economic development. One section of the report is actually titled, &quot;Most learners were left behind,&quot; citing estimates that &quot;at least half of all students expected to access remote learning systems to continue their education were unable to do so due to technology gaps... In many parts of the world, accessing education via a technology portal was so uncommon and so unrealistic that many families did not even know that the option existed when schools closed.&quot;

This should not have come as a particular surprise. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the specialized agency of the United Nations for ICT, estimated that approximately 3.7 billion people — roughly half of the world&#x27;s population — lacked a functional internet connection in 2020... Countries around the world invested heavily in internet-connected solutions for education, even though these solutions commonly reached only a minority of students, resulting in a bifurcation of educational opportunity. 

The report begins with a warning from the agency&#x27;s assistant director-general for education. &quot;Ultimately, we should heed this publication&#x27;s recommendation to exercise greater humility and caution when considering the educational promise of the latest technological marvels.&quot;

                              <span>Rotten Tomatoes celebrated its 25th year of assigning scores to movies based on their aggregate review. Now Vulture writes that Rotten Tomatoes &quot;can make or break&quot; movies, &quot;with implications for how films are perceived, released, marketed, and possibly even green-lit&quot;. But unfortuately, the site &quot;is also erratic, reductive, and easily hacked.&quot; 

Vulture tells the story of a movie-publicity company contacting &quot;obscure, often self-published critics&quot; to say the film&#x27;s teams &quot;feel like it would benefit from more input from different critics&quot; — while making undisclosed payments of $50 or more.) A critic asking if it&#x27;s okay to pan the movie was informed that &quot;super nice&quot; critics move their bad reviews onto sites not included in Rotten Tomatoes scores.

                              <span>On August 30th the University of Michigan announced it had finally restored its internet connectivity and Wi-Fi network, according to the Ann Arbor News, &quot;after several days of outages caused by a &#x27;significant security concern,&#x27; officials said.&quot; The outage coincided with the first days of the new school year, although &quot;classes continued through the outage.&quot;
The internet was shut down on 1:45 p.m. on Sunday, Aug. 27, after the Information Assurance team at the university identified a security concern, according to previous reporting. The Information Assurance team fights cybersecurity threats and malicious actors... The investigation into the security issue is ongoing and no other information will be released, said Santa Ono, president of University of Michigan.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this report from the senior space editor at Ars Technica:
In a new report, the federal department charged with analyzing how efficiently U.S. taxpayer dollars are spent, the Government Accountability Office, says NASA lacks transparency on the true costs of its Space Launch System rocket program. Published on Thursday, the new report (see .pdf) examines the billions of dollars spent by NASA on the development of the massive rocket, which made a successful debut launch in late 2022 with the Artemis I mission. Surprisingly, as part of the reporting process, NASA officials admitted the rocket was too expensive to support its lunar exploration efforts as part of the Artemis program. &quot;Senior NASA officials told GAO that at current cost levels, the SLS program is unaffordable,&quot; the new report states... 


Moreover, the report indicates that NASA has not regularly updated its five-year production cost estimates for the rocket. The report also cites concerns about development costs of future hardware for NASA&#x27;s big-ticket rocket program, including the Exploration Upper Stage. Another problem with NASA&#x27;s cost estimates is that they do not appear to account for delays to Artemis missions. It is probable that the Artemis II mission, a crewed flight around the Moon, will launch no earlier than 2025. The Artemis III crewed landing will likely slip to at least 2026, if not more, with additional delays down the line... 


NASA officials interviewed by the Government Accountability Office acknowledged that they were concerned about the costs of the SLS rocket. &quot;NASA recognizes the need to improve the affordability of the SLS program and is taking steps to do so,&quot; the report states. &quot;Senior agency officials have told us that at current cost levels the SLS program is unsustainable and exceeds what NASA officials believe will be available for its Artemis missions.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Bloomberg: Cryptocurrency trading volume declined in August to the lowest level of the year, another sign of waning investor interest since the collapse of digital asset prices from all-time highs in late 2021. The combined monthly volume of so-called spot and derivatives trading fell 11.5% to $2.09 trillion, and was the second-lowest monthly total since October 2020, according to data compiled by CCData. &quot;The (spot) trading volumes on centralized exchanges have remained low since April this year and are now comparable to the stagnant trading activity in the bear market of 2019,&quot; CCData said in a report published Thursday.
 
The tepid interest appears to be carrying into September, with crypto bellwether Bitcoin little changed through much of the first week of the month. Bitcoin, which accounts for about half of crypto&#x27;s $1 trillion market capitalization, was little changed at around $25,800 on Thursday. It almost reached $69,000 in November 2021. [...] While Binance remains the largest exchange for crypto spot trading, its market share shrank for the sixth straight month, settling at 38.5%, the lowest since August 2022, according to CCData.

                              <span>A web caching issue resulted in some Wyze security camera owners being able to see webcam feeds that weren&#x27;t theirs. The Verge reports: Earlier on Friday, users on Reddit made posts about the issue. &quot;Went to check on my cameras and they are all gone be replaced with a new one... and this isn&#x27;t mine!&quot; wrote one user. &quot;Apologies if this is your house / dog... I don&#x27;t want it showing up as much as you don&#x27;t want it!&quot; &quot;I am able to click the events tab and see ALL the events on this random person&#x27;s camera INSIDE their house,&quot; wrote another. &quot;I don&#x27;t know why, but I can see someone else&#x27;s camera,&quot; wrote another.
 
Each thread has comments from other Reddit users reporting similar issues. Shockingly, I even saw some instances of people claiming they saw the same cameras that other people did. The user reports indicated that they were seeing the other feeds through Wyze&#x27;s web viewer at view.wyze.com.

                              <span>Dennis Austin, the principal software developer of PowerPoint, passed away from lung cancer on Sept. 1. He was 76. The Washington Post reports: Released in 1987 by Forethought, a small software firm, PowerPoint was the digital successor to overhead projectors, transforming the labor-intensive process of creating slides -- a task typically assigned to design departments or outsourced -- to one where any employee with a computer could point, click and rearrange information with a mouse. &quot;Our users were familiar with computers, but probably not graphics software,&quot; Mr. Austin wrote in an unpublished history of the software&#x27;s development. &quot;They were highly motivated to look their best in front of others, but they weren&#x27;t savvy in graphics design.&quot;
 
Working alongside Robert Gaskins, the Forethought executive who conceived the software, it was Mr. Austin&#x27;s job as the software engineer to make PowerPoint (originally called Presenter) easy to operate. He accomplished this with a &quot;direct-manipulation interface,&quot; he wrote, meaning that &quot;what you are editing looks exactly like the final product.&quot; Originally targeted for Macintosh computers, which had a graphical interface, Presenter included ways for users to incorporate graphics, clip art and multiple fonts. In addition, the slides could be uniform with graphic borders, corporate logos and slide numbers. The goal, Mr. Austin wrote, was &quot;to create presentations -- not simply slides.&quot;
 
In his book &quot;Sweating Bullets: Notes about Inventing PowerPoint&quot; (2012), Gaskins wrote that &quot;Dennis came up with at least half of the major design ideas,&quot; and was &quot;completely responsible for the fluid performance and the polished finish of the implementation.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s a good bet,&quot; Gaskins added, &quot;that if Dennis had not been the person designing PowerPoint, no one would ever have heard of it.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from 404 Media: Historically, video game preservation efforts usually cover two types of games. The most common are very old or &quot;retro&quot; games from the 16-bit era or earlier, which are trapped on cartridges until they&#x27;re liberated via downloadable ROMs. The other are games that rely on a live service, like Enter the Matrix&#x27;s now unplugged servers or whatever games you can only get by downloading them via Nintendo&#x27;s Wii Shop Channel, which shut down in 2019. But time keeps marching on and a more recent era of games now needs to be attended to if we still want those games to be accessible: indies from the late aughts to mid twenty-teens. That&#x27;s right. Fez, an icon of the era and indie games scene, is now more than a decade old. And while we don&#x27;t think of t…</span>

                              <span>The SEC has approved the Nasdaq&#x27;s request to operate the first exchange AI-driven order type. CoinTelegraph reports: Called the dynamic midpoint extended life order (M-ELO), the new system expands on the M-ELO automated order type by making it &quot;dynamic,&quot; meaning it will use artificial intelligence to update and, essentially, recalibrate itself in real-time. Order types are a set of software instructions that execute specific trade pairs at exact market pricing thresholds. This form of automation has been around for a while, but the new AI-driven order type is the first of its kind to use real-time reinforcement learning AI to execute orders
 
This should have the follow-on effect of substantially speeding up orders placed with the system. In a blog post accompanying the approval announcement, Nasdaq states that dynamic M-ELO demonstrated a &quot;20.3% increase in fill rates and an 11.4% reduction in mark-outs&quot; during its research and testing. According to a data sheet published by Nasdaq: &quot;Calculated on a symbol-by-symbol basis, this new functionality analyzes 140+ data points every 30 seconds to detect market conditions and optimize the holding period prior to which a trade is eligible to execute.&quot; By adjusting the holding periods for orders in real time, as opposed to the traditional system that simply applies static timeouts to orders, fill rates should increase without a significant increase in market impact.

                              <span>According to Android specialist Mishaal Rahman, Android miscalculates the storage space taken up by system components, leading to inflated system storage utilization and potentially misleading users. Chandraveer Mathur writes via Android Police. From the report: We usually rely on Android&#x27;s storage utilization utility to find apps and files eating up storage space, so we can uninstall or delete them if required. However, Android specialist Mishaal Rahman discovered that Google&#x27;s calculation of the space consumed by Android system components is flawed. He executed shell commands to create a 3GB file in the /data/media/0 storage directory, which isn&#x27;t a file path used for Android system files. However, the phone&#x27;s storage breakdown showed a marked 3GB increase under the System heading, suggesting the OS suddenly became bigger.
 
This happens because Android calculates system storage as the space used up by anything other than what&#x27;s covered by other categories in the storage breakdown, including audios, videos, images, documents, trash, and games. This means the System heading in the break doesn&#x27;t just include Android system files. Android 14 also uses this dangerously flawed logic for calculating storage usage. Moreover, the Files app by Google also shows similar storage utilization by Android system components, perhaps because it uses the same incredulous attribution logic. By association, all other Android skins use flawed calculation of used storage space, but Samsung reportedly fixed this issue with the One UI 6 update. After running similar ADB commands as in the previous experiment, Rahman could confirm the increased utilization showed up under the Other files heading in the storage breakdown, instead of the System heading.

                              <span>Indonesia has awarded OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman its first &quot;Golden Visa&quot; -- a week after the program was launched to attract foreign investment to Southeast Asia&#x27;s largest economy. CNBC reports: &quot;There are several categories of golden visas apart from those based on investment/capital investment, one of which is the golden visa which is given to figures who have an international reputation and can provide benefits for Indonesia,&quot; Silmy Karim, Indonesia&#x27;s director general of immigration, said in a statement. &quot;With this golden visa, the hope is that Altman can contribute towards the development and use of AI in Indonesia,&quot; Karim said.
 
Altman&#x27;s Golden Visa is for 10 years. As a holder of the visa, the American entrepreneur will get to enjoy priority screening at airports across the country&#x27;s vast archipelago, along with longer periods of stay, and ease of entry and exit.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: Apple released security updates on Thursday that patch two zero-day exploits -- meaning hacking techniques that were unknown at the time Apple found out about them -- used against a member of a civil society organization in Washington, D.C., according to the researchers who found the vulnerabilities. Citizen Lab, an internet watchdog group that investigates government malware, published a short blog post explaining that last week they found a zero-click vulnerability -- meaning that the hackers&#x27; target doesn&#x27;t have to tap or click anything, such as an attachment -- used to target victims with malware.
 
The researchers said the vulnerability was used as part of an exploit chain designed to deliver NSO Group&#x27;s malware, known as Pegasus. &quot;The exploit chain was capable of compromising iPhones running the latest version of iOS (16.6) without any interaction from the victim,&quot; Citizen Lab wrote. Once they found the vulnerability, the researchers reported it to Apple, which released a patch on Thursday, thanking Citizen Lab for reporting them. Based on what Citizen Lab wrote in the blog post, and the fact that Apple also patched another vulnerability and attributed its finding to the company itself, it appears Apple may have found the second vulnerability while investigating the first. Citizen Lab researcher John Scott-Railton says Apple&#x27;s Lockdown Mode would have blocked the exploits found in this case. Lockdown Mode is an opt-in feature introduced in iOS 16 that gives users the option to temporarily switch off or limit features for security purposes. According to Apple, it &quot;should be used only if you believe you may be targeted by a highly sophisticated cyberattack, such as by a private company developing state-sponsored mercenary spyware.&quot;

                              <span>Cerabyte, a technology startup pioneering ceramic nanolayer-based storage, claims it will usher in the &quot;Yottabyte Era&quot; and disrupt the $500 billion storage market in the process. Tom&#x27;s Hardware reports: More specifically, its roadmaps sketch out CeraMemory cartridges (2025-30) storing between 10 PB and 100 PB, and its CeraTape (2030-35) with up to 1 EB capacity per tape. According to the startup, these new formats are poised to address density, performance, and access paradigms, as well as the cost and sustainability demands of datacenters. Cerabyte, a German storage startup, has published an abstract from its upcoming presentation at the 2023 Storage Developer Conference in Fremont, California (h/t Blocks and Files).

                              <span>The FTC&#x27;s chief administrative law judge (ALJ) ruled that Intuit, the parent company of TurboTax, &quot;deceived consumers&quot; and &quot;engaged in deceptive advertising&quot; by advertising its &quot;Free Edition&quot; tax filing service as free when users ultimately had to pay. The Verge reports: The ruling (PDF) includes several pages of commercials and online ads where Intuit advertised its &quot;Free Edition&quot; software. While the name implies that the service is, well, free, people wound up having to pay to use it -- sparking a lawsuit from the FTC and a $141 million payout to affected users. Meanwhile, Intuit&#x27;s actually no-cost Free File version, which it launched in partnership with the IRS, remained exceedingly difficult to find. In 2021, Intuit exited the program after the IRS stopped letting companies hide their free filing services from search engines.
 
The FTC&#x27;s ALJ determined that there is a &quot;cognizant danger of a recurring violation&quot; by Intuit and issued a cease-and-desist order that prohibits the company from &quot;engaging in deceptive practices in the future.&quot; The ruling prevents Intuit from representing a product as free unless it actually is free for everyone to use and &quot;clearly and conspicuously discloses any terms that would limit the offer.&quot; In a statement, Intuit called the FTC&#x27;s investigation process &quot;flawed and highly questionable,&quot; noting &quot;Intuit already adheres to most of the advertising practices in the FTC&#x27;s erroneous decision.&quot; The company adds that it has &quot;been clear, fair, and transparent&quot; with customers and remains &quot;committed to free tax preparation.&quot;

It&#x27;s available for $20/month in the US or 18 pounds/month in the UK, and it promises five-times-higher usage limits, priority access to Claude during high-traffic periods, and early access to new features as they emerge. Like ChatGPT, Claude Pro can compose text, summarize, do analysis, solve logic puzzles, and more.
 
Claude.ai is what Anthropic offers as its conversational interface for its Claude 2 AI language model, similar to how ChatGPT provides an application wrapper for the underlying models GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. In February, OpenAI chose a subscripti…</span>

                              <span>Microsoft is teaming up with digital pathology provider Paige to build the world&#x27;s largest image-based artificial intelligence model for identifying cancer. From a report: The AI model is training on an unprecedented amount of data that includes billions of images, according to a release. It can identify both common cancers and rare cancers that are notoriously difficult to diagnose, and researchers hope it will eventually help doctors who are struggling to contend with staffing shortages and growing caseloads. Paige develops digital and AI-powered solutions for pathologists, which are doctors who carry out lab tests on bodily fluids and tissues to make a diagnosis. It&#x27;s a specialty that often operates behind the scenes, and it&#x27;s crucial for determining a patient&#x27;s path forward. 

&quot;You don&#x27;t have cancer until the pathologist says so. That&#x27;s the critical step in the whole medical edifice,&quot; Thomas Fuchs, co-founder and chief scientist at Paige, told CNBC in an interview. But despite pathologists&#x27; essential role in medicine, Fuchs said their workflow has not changed much in the last 150 years. To diagnose cancer, for instance, pathologists usually examine a piece of tissue on a glass slide under a microscope. The method is tried and true, but if pathologists miss something, it can have dire consequences for patients.

From a report: The federal government has announced it is taking statutory declarations into the digital age, saying it will accept electronic signatures and video link witnessing from next year. It makes permanent a change introduced during the pandemic, when attending a justice of the peace (JP) for a statutory declaration -- a practice that goes back to the 19th century -- was forbidden under lockdown restrictions. 

Legislation introduced this week by the federal attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, will also allow people to digitally execute a statutory declaration using the online platform myGov and the myGovID Digital ID. Dreyfus says the bill is intended to keep with the changing ways of Australians. &quot;This bill will respond to how Australians want and expect to engage and communicate digitally with government by providing options to make commonwealth statutory declarations facilitated by technology,&quot; he says. &quot;This bill is an important milestone in driving the digitisation of government services.&quot;

                              <span>Apple might be the king of tech. But in the growing cold economic war between the world&#x27;s two biggest economies, it is becoming just another game piece -- albeit a big one. WSJ: Still the world&#x27;s largest public company by market value, Apple has seen that value take a notable hit this week on increasing signs that its business in China might be coming under threat. The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that the Chinese government is banning the iPhone and other foreign-branded devices from use by workers at central government agencies. Bloomberg reported Thursday that such a ban might also be extended to state-owned enterprises and other government-backed entities. That could amount to a significant swath of people in a state-led economy with a population totaling more than 1.4 billion. 

According to China&#x27;s National Bureau of Statistics, about 56.3 million urban workers were employed by &quot;state-owned units&quot; in 2021. Those jobs commanded an average wage about 8% above the national urban average -- an attractive segment for a company specializing in premium devices. And because Apple now ships roughly 230 million iPhones globally every year, 56 million would be a notable chunk to take out of the pool of potential buyers -- especially in a mature global smartphone market with low growth prospects. [...] Apple&#x27;s stock price has thus slumped nearly 7% over the past two days, costing the company about $194 billion in market value. That might seem excessive considering the many unknowns about the reported iPhone bans and how they could ultimately play out. Also, China has at least some interest in not overly harming a major local employer during a time of growing unemployment. One Chinese city alone reportedly has more than one million workers building Apple products or employed in related jobs.

                              <span>Governments are failing to cut greenhouse gas emissions fast enough to meet the goals of the Paris agreement and to stave off climate disaster, a major report by the UN has found. From a report: Meeting the goals will require &quot;phasing out all unabated fossil fuels,&quot; the report says, in an acknowledgment that some oil-producing countries may find hard to take. The need to phase out fossil fuels has not been explicitly adopted by the UN before, under successive rounds of climate talks, and language over &quot;phasing out&quot; or &quot;phasing down&quot; fossil fuels has caused controversy at the annual UN climate talks. 

There is a &quot;rapidly narrowing window&quot; for governments to move faster, according to the report, as global greenhouse gas emissions must peak by 2025 at the latest, and be rapidly reduced from there, to limit temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Emissions are still rising, however, and there is a gap of 20 to 23 gigatonnes of CO2 between the cuts needed by 2030 to limit global temperatures to 1.5C and the world&#x27;s current emissions trajectory. The report, which was expected next week but was published hurriedly in draft by the UN on Friday, will form the basis of the first &quot;global stocktake&quot; under the 2015 Paris agreement. That process is meant to track countries&#x27; efforts to meet the goals of the treaty.

                              <span>New York law enforcement agencies have spent millions of dollars to expand their capabilities to track and analyze social media posts, new documents show, including by contracting with a surveillance firm accused of improperly scraping social media platforms for data. From a report: Documents obtained by the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (Stop), a privacy advocacy non-profit and shared with the Guardian, reveal the New York police department in 2018 entered a nearly $9m contract with Voyager Labs, a surveillance company that has been sued by Meta for allegedly using nearly 40,000 fake Facebook accounts to collect data on an estimated 600,000 users. NYPD purchased Voyager Labs products that the company claims can use artificial intelligence to analyze online human behavior and detect and predict fraud and crimes, the documents show. 

A separate document reveals a contract between the Queens district attorney and Israeli firm Cobwebs Technologies, which also offers social network mapping products, as well as tools to track location information through phones. It&#x27;s unclear how much that contract is worth. Law enforcement across the United States have worked with social media analytics companies for years, hoping to more effectively and efficiently collect and make sense of the hordes of personal information available on the internet. But experts have argued the practice can cross ethical and legal lines, particularly when used to access private information, make inferences or predict future criminality based on the content posted on social media, or otherwise help law enforcement skip obtaining subpoenas and warrants before gathering information on someone.

                              <span>Researchers at digital watchdog group Citizen Lab say they found spyware they linked to Israeli firm NSO that exploited a newly discovered flaw in Apple devices. From a report: While inspecting the Apple device of an employee of a Washington-based civil society group last week, Citizen Lab said it found the flaw had been used to infect the device with NSO&#x27;s Pegasus spyware, it said in a statement. 

Bill Marczak, senior researcher at Citizen Lab, said the attacker likely made a mistake during the installation which is how Citizen Lab found the spyware. Citizen Lab said Apple confirmed to them that using the high security feature &quot;Lockdown Mode&quot; available on Apple devices blocks this particular attack. The flaw allowed compromise of iPhones running the latest version of iOS (16.6) without any interaction from the victim, the digital watchdog said. The new update fixes this vulnerability.

                              <span>The Internal Revenue Service has started using artificial intelligence to investigate tax evasion at multibillion-dollar partnerships as it looks for ways to better police hedge funds, private equity groups, real estate investors and large law firms. From a report: The announcement on Friday demonstrated how a more muscular I.R.S. is using some of the $80 billion allocated through last year&#x27;s Inflation Reduction Act to target the wealthiest Americans and tackle the kinds of cases that had become too complex and cumbersome for the beleaguered agency to handle. The agency&#x27;s new funding is intended to help the I.R.S. raise more federal revenue by cracking down on tax cheats and others who use sophisticated accounting maneuvers to avoid paying what they owe. But the allocation has been politically contentious, with Republicans claiming that the I.R.S. will use the funding to harass small businesses and middle-class taxpayers. 

Earlier this year, Republicans succeeded in clawing back $20 billion as part of an agreement to raise the nation&#x27;s borrowing cap. That political fight has put the onus on Democrats and the Biden administration to show that the funding is primarily enabling the I.R.S. to target the rich. &quot;These are complex cases for I.R.S. teams to unpack,&quot; Daniel Werfel, the I.R.S. commissioner, said in a briefing with reporters. &quot;The I.R.S. has simply not had enough resources or staffing to address partnerships; in a real sense, we&#x27;ve been overwhelmed in this area for years.&quot;

                              <span>A special commission within Poland&#x27;s Senate concluded that the government&#x27;s use of spyware, like the one made by NSO Group, is illegal. From a report: The commission announced on Thursday the conclusion of its 18-month-long investigation into allegations that the Polish government used NSO&#x27;s spyware, known as Pegasus, to spy on an opposition politician and other politicians around the time of the country&#x27;s 2019 elections. &quot;Pegasus cannot be used under Polish law,&quot; the report read, according to a machine translation. &quot;This is because the Polish legal system does not allow the use of programs in which acquired operational data is transferred through transmission channels uncontrolled by the relevant services, as this creates the risk of violating its integrity and does not ensure its confidentiality, as required by law.&quot; 

In other words, NSO&#x27;s spyware is not designed in a way that respects Polish law, collects too much information, and cannot guarantee that that information is secured properly, according to the report. The commission also concluded that the Polish government used Pegasus to retaliate against opposition figures, and that these surveillance operations negatively influenced the 2019 elections in the country. The commission compared these abuses with Russian government hackers activities in the 2016 elections in the United States.

                              <span>Siddharth Vikram Philip, Sabah Meddings, and Supriya Singh, reporting for Bloomberg News: As chief commercial officer of aircraft-parts supplier AOG Technics, Ray Kwong can look back on a well-rounded career at A-list companies including All Nippon Airways, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Nissan Motor. That, at least, is Kwong&#x27;s two-decade corporate journey on what appears to be his LinkedIn profile, from which the self-proclaimed executive beams with a broad smile and striped tie in blue hues. Trouble is that -- much like the company for which Kwong now claims to work -- not all is as it seems. Kwong, if he even exists, was never employed at Nissan, or at ANA for that matter. Neither company has records of him as a former worker, they said in response to queries by Bloomberg News. His employment history could also not be verified at Mitsubishi. What is used as his profile picture turns out to be a stock photo that&#x27;s also washed up elsewhere on the Internet, from promotional material for a German textile startup to a clinic in Northbrook, Illinois. 

After Bloomberg reported on the case of bogus jet-engine repair parts being investigated by regulators, a deeper dive into AOG revealed that the fabrication not only concerned components, but extended to major aspects of the company behind the scandal. The proliferation of undocumented parts has sent shock waves through an industry where every component requires verification to ensure aircraft safety, leaving manufacturers, operators and authorities scrambling to determine the fallout. The parts supplied by AOG went into engines that power many older-generation Airbus SE A320 and Boeing 737 planes, by far the most widely flown category of commercial aircraft. These single-aisle jets are used by millions of passengers each day and by most airlines, mainly on short-haul flights. Airbus said it&#x27;s aware of media reports surrounding AOG, while Boeing said it will defer to regulators on the topic.

                              <span>Clubhouse, the invite-only social audio app that went viral during the pandemic, is trying to make a comeback by rebranding itself as a better alternative for group texting. Engadget reports: The audio app is pivoting from its signature &quot;drop-in&quot; audio conversations to friend-centric voice chats, the company said in an update. Instead of sprawling rooms where users host live-streamed conversations open to any and all of the app&#x27;s users, the new Clubhouse will instead encourage users to join groups with people they know.
 
The groups are, somewhat confusingly, called &quot;chats,&quot; and allow friends and friends-of-friends to exchange voice messages. There&#x27;s still a &quot;drop-in&quot; element, but it&#x27;s less focused on real-time talking and geared more toward something like an Instagram Story -- a destination for checking in and sharing quick updates. The app is also ditching text-based direct messages in favor of private audio messages which, yes, it&#x27;s calling voicemails or VMs.
 
The biggest shift, however, isn&#x27;t just the format of the conversations but that Clubhouse is now positioning itself as more of a Snapchat, where smaller groups of friends communicate privately or semi-privately, than a Twitter, where all the app&#x27;s users are shouting into the void. &quot;It&#x27;s not about passively listening to people speaking,&quot; the company wrote in an update. &quot;You can listen to great conversations on podcasts, YouTube, TikTok, and a lot of other platforms. It&#x27;s about talking with people ... and becoming real-life friends with your friends&#x27; friends, and people you never would have met otherwise.&quot;

                              <span>I&#x27;m often asked how you know if an idea — product, business, or otherwise — is good. Good enough to pursue. Good enough to follow. Good enough to invest in. Good enough to get behind.


You don&#x27;t know. You feel. You give into your intuition, you tune into your senses, you notice goosebumps. What does it feel like? What&#x27;s the vibe of this thing? That&#x27;s what I want to know. 


Good ideas are like slipstreams — they have their own effortless, accelerated pull. They slide rather than grind. They have a smooth, silky texture — like a perfect milkshake being drawn through a wide straw. Everything has a nature, and good ideas have theirs.


Feeling like you&#x27;re on to something is an unmistakable feeling. Don&#x27;t look for it, don&#x27;t ask about it, don&#x27;t fish for opinions. Feel for it.

                              <span>After almost four years leading the Rust Infrastructure Team, in late July I
expressed my intent to step down as lead of the team to focus back on
technical work. On one side, I need to rest and recharge after doing
organizational and governance work for so long. On the other side, it&#x27;s healthy
for the team to rotate its leadership role to bring fresh ideas to the table!
Like the other Rust teams, the lead in the infra team is not who makes the
final decision, and their vote doesn&#x27;t have more weight. We make all decisions
together, and the lead is mostly responsible for running meetings, making sure
important tasks are not dropped on the floor, and representing the team with
third parties.
The whole team met this week to discuss our future. We decided that we want to
take inspiration from the compiler team&#x27;s rolling leads: we will
have two leads at the same time, with the expectation that after a number of
years (still to be defined) the one who served the most time as lead will step
down, making space for a new lead. We will also document our process in the
coming months.
We also have consensus on the two new leads of the team! I&#x27;m happy to announce
that for the next few years, the new team leads for infra will be:
Jake Goulding (@shepmaster), long time member of the infra team. He
maintains the Rust Playground, and has been instrumental in the
support for Apple Silicon in our CI.
Jan David Nose (@jdno), who joined the Rust Foundation last year to work
full-time inside the infrastructure team, bringing a lot of experience and
time.
On behalf of the team I want to thank them for stepping up, and we all wish
them best of luck in their new role!
As for myself, I&#x27;m proud of the work the whole team has been doing over the
past four years and all the challenges we overcame. It&#x27;s been an honor serving
as the lead and I look forward to going back to technical work in the coming
months.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Gizmodo: Google&#x27;s Privacy Sandbox, a controversial set of tools and settings meant to replace third-party cookies, is now on almost every single Chrome browser, according to a company blog post published Thursday. Google says Privacy Sandbox is now available to around 97% of Chrome users, and that number will reach 100% in the next few months. The news comes on the heels of the browser&#x27;s 15th anniversary, which Google is celebrating by redesigning Chrome to make it look and feel more closely aligned with the design paradigm of Android and the rest of the Google suite. The final step in this process comes in 2024, when Google will disable third-party cookies in Chrome for good, marking the end of their decades-long reign of privacy-violating terror.

                              <span>Morgan Stanley is rolling out a generative AI chatbot this month to help bankers quickly find research or forms without needing to sift through hundreds of thousands of documents. According to Reuters, it&#x27;s being developed with OpenAI. From the report: The bank is also developing technology which eventually, with clients&#x27; permission, could create a meeting summary of the conversation, draft a follow-up email suggesting next steps, update the bank&#x27;s sales database, schedule a follow-up appointment, and learn how to help advisers manage clients&#x27; finances on areas such as taxes, retirement savings and inheritances. The details of the program have not yet been reported.
 
While the bot will give insights and administrative support to financial advisers, investment advice will remain the purview of humans. &quot;The adviser is still at the center,&quot; said [Sal Cucchiara, Morgan Stanley&#x27;s chief information officer of wealth and investment management, who is among the executives driving the bank&#x27;s push into AI]. For now, employees view the technology as a helpful tool and aren&#x27;t worried that they&#x27;ll be replaced by bots, he said. The AI initiative is part of Morgan Stanley&#x27;s strategy to drive its wealth division, where net revenue surged 16% to a record in the second quarter and new client assets grew $90 billion.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from CNBC: Chinese state-aligned influence and disinformation campaigns are impersonating U.S. voters and targeting political candidates on multiple social media platforms with improved sophistication, Microsoft said in a threat analysis report Thursday. Chinese Communist Party-affiliated &quot;covert influence operations have now begun to successfully engage with target audiences on social media to a greater extent than previously observed,&quot; according to the report, which focused on the rise in &quot;digital threats from East Asia.&quot; The Microsoft report also cautioned that some Chinese influence campaigns are now using generative artificial intelligence to create visual content that&#x27;s &quot;already drawn higher levels of engagement from authentic&quot; users, a trend the company said began around March.
 
Chinese influence campaigns have historically struggled to gain traction with intended targets, who in this case are U.S. voters and residents. But since the 2022 midterm elections, those efforts have become more effective, Microsoft warned. Microsoft found content from Chinese influence campaigns on multiple apps, including Meta&#x27;s Facebook and Instagram, Microsoft-owned LinkedIn, and X. In August, Facebook parent Meta announced it had disrupted the largest ever identified disinformation campaign and linked it to China state-affiliated actors. Microsoft&#x27;s report included screenshots of two different X posts in April that were identified as CCP-affiliated disinformation. Both were about the Black Lives Matter movement and had the same graphic. The first came from an automated CCP-affiliated account. The second, Microsoft said, was uploaded by an account impersonating a conservative U.S. voter seven hours later.

                              <span>Ruby on Rails creator David Heinemeier Hansson has removed TypeScript from the forthcoming version 8 of the Turbo framework, saying he has &quot;never been a fan,&quot; but many Turbo users have protested that the decision was rushed and the change is unwelcome. From a report: A comment on the GitHub pull request that removes TypeScript states that this &quot;is a step back, for both library users and contributors.&quot; This comment has -- at the time of writing -- 357 likes and just 8 downvotes, suggesting wide support. Turbo is a framework for delivering HTML pages intended to &quot;dramatically reduce the amount of custom JavaScript,&quot; and is sponsored by Hannson&#x27;s company 37signals, whose products include the Basecamp project management platform and the Hey messaging system. Turbo is the engine of Hotwire, short for &quot;HTML over the wire,&quot; because it prefers sending HTML itself rather than JSON data and JavaScript code. 

Although Turbo itself is not among the most popular frameworks, Ruby on Rails is well-known and used by major web sites including GitHub and Shopify. Hansson posted that TypeScript &quot;pollutes the code with type gymnastics that add ever so little joy to my development experience, and quite frequently considerable grief. Things that should be easy become hard.&quot; The community around the open source Turbo project though is for the most part perplexed and disappointed, not only by the change itself, but also by the manner in which it was made.

                              <span>OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT, the wildly popular artificial intelligence chatbot launched in November, saw monthly website visits decline for the third month in a row in August, though there are signs the decline is coming to an end, according to analytics firm Similarweb. Reuters: Worldwide desktop and mobile website visits to the ChatGPT website decreased by 3.2% to 1.43 billion in August, following approximately 10% drops from each of the previous two months. The amount of time visitors spent on the website has also been declining monthly since March, from an average of 8.7 minutes on site to 7 minutes on site in August. But August worldwide unique visitors ticked up to 180.5 million users from 180 million. 

School coming back into session in September may help ChatGPT&#x27;s traffic and usage, and some schools have begun to embrace it. U.S. ChatGPT traffic in August rose slightly, in concert with American schools being back in session. &quot;Students seeking homework help appears to be part of the story: the percentage of younger users of the website dropped over the summer and is now starting to bounce back,&quot; said David F. Carr of Similarweb, who regularly tracks ChatGPT and its competitors.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Artificial intelligence, according to Nicolai Tangen, head of Norway&#x27;s huge $1.4tn oil fund, is like being &quot;in a rocket on the way into space ... It&#x27;s hugely exciting, but it&#x27;s also scary.&quot; Stretching the metaphor to its limits, the head of the world&#x27;s largest sovereign wealth fund adds: &quot;We hope we&#x27;re in Apollo 11, not Challenger. The mission statement is to return safely.&quot; All this might just seem to be a glib soundbite, but the Norwegian fund is among the most advanced of any of the world&#x27;s big traditional investors in publicly articulating its thoughts on AI. This is not just on the balance between risk and opportunity from AI but also what it thinks the companies it invests in should be doing. As the importance of AI only grows, the oil fund&#x27;s stance is going to be well worth following. 

[...] The first is ensuring boards are accountable for the responsible development and use of AI. Here, Tangen is damning. &quot;Boards are absolutely not on top of this,&quot; he says. Given how many companies have long struggled to get enough expertise on cyber security, AI is likely to be an even tougher ask. The oil fund could vote against those that do nothing, Tangen adds. The second relates to how transparent companies are on how they use AI and how they explain how those systems have been designed and tested. As well as the tech industry itself, the fund is paying particular attention to those sectors using AI with consumers such as healthcare, financial and consumer goods. The final element is risk management. The fund argues that companies should be proactive, and ensure outside verification and auditing of their AI systems and risk management processes.

The Senate voted 55 to 43 to approve Anna Gomez as the fifth FCC Commissioner. Her term will be for five years from July 1, 2021, so effectively about three years. From a report: Gomez most recently has served as a senior advisor on communications policy at the Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy. She was also deputy administrator at the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) from 2009 to 2013. The NTIA is not only important as the advisor to the President on national spectrum policy, but the agency is also currently overseeing the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment (BEAD) program.

                              <span>Microsoft says it will defend buyers of its artificial intelligence products from copyright infringement lawsuits, an effort by the software giant to ease concerns customers might have about using its AI &quot;Copilots&quot; to generate content based on existing work. From a report: The Microsoft Copilot Copyright Commitment will protect customers as long as they&#x27;ve &quot;used the guardrails and content filters we have built into our products&quot; Hossein Nowbar, General Counsel, Corporate Legal Affairs and Corporate Secretary at Microsoft, said in a blog post Thursday. Microsoft also pledged to pay related fines or settlements and said it has taken steps to ensure its Copilots respect copyright. 

&quot;We believe in standing behind our customers when they use our products,&quot; Nowbar said. &quot;We are charging our commercial customers for our Copilots, and if their use creates legal issues, we should make this our problem rather than our customers&#x27; problem.&quot; Generative AI applications scoop up existing content such as art, articles and programming code and use it to generate new material that can simplify or automate a range of tasks. Microsoft is baking the technology, developed with partner OpenAI, into many of its biggest products, including Office and Windows, potentially putting customers in legal jeopardy.

                              <span>Google is killing off the last vestiges of Google Play Movies &amp; TV, a service that sold premium Hollywood films and TV shows as part of Google&#x27;s once-cohesive string of Google Play content stores. From a report: The company emailed users of Android TV to say that the &quot;Google Play Movies &amp; TV app will no longer be available on your Android TV device from 05 October 2023. You can continue to buy or rent movies directly through the Shop tab on your Android TV.&quot; Play Movies has been going through a slow death as Google shuffles around its media content. The smartphone Play Movies app became &quot;Google TV&quot; in 2022, and that same year, the Play Store app was stripped of movie and TV sales. 

On third-party smart TVs (this is a different category than today&#x27;s Android TV announcement) the app was killed in 2021. On Android TV, the new &quot;Shop&quot; tab seems to just be an OS-integrated Google TV content store. If you think this sounds confusing, you&#x27;re not alone. Google&#x27;s support page reflects the ridiculous state of Google&#x27;s video apps, instructing users that &quot;in Your Library, you can find content that you bought from: Google Play Movies &amp; TV, YouTube, Android TV, Google TV.&quot; How any normal person is supposed to understand that pile of Google media brands, and how it works across phones, the web, and various smart TV OSes, is beyond me.

                              <span>A new report says that a PR firm has been paying Rotten Tomatoes critics for positive reviews for over five years. From a report: Moviegoers, critics, and the average internet user have all used the aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes at one point or another. The website categorizes films and shows from &quot;fresh&quot; to &quot;rotten,&quot; with rotten being those with lower ratings. Now it looks like the site&#x27;s scores have been manipulated for more than five years. As noted by Vulture, it looks like a PR firm has manipulated movie scores on Rotten Tomatoes by paying the critics directly. This has been happening for years. 

The PR firm, named Bunker 15, is said to pay as much as $50.00 for a single Rotten Tomatoes review. The payments, which aren&#x27;t typically disclosed, are usually given to obscure critics who happen to be part of a pool tracked by Rotten Tomatoes. Though it&#x27;s worth noting that the aggregation site&#x27;s rules prohibit &quot;Reviewing based on a financial incentive.&quot; Director Paul Schrader, also a critic, spoke out against Rotten Tomatoes which he says is part of a &quot;broken&quot; system. &quot;The system is broken. Audiences are dumber. Normal people don&#x27;t go through reviews like they used to. Rotten Tomatoes is something the studios can game. So they do.&quot; The site responded by delisting a variety of Bunker 15 films from their website. Furthermore, they issued a warning to any critics that reviewed them. The warning emphasizes that they do not tolerate manipulation on their platform.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: In Cologne last month, Nintendo&#x27;s public Gamescom showfloor booth let you play Pikmin 4 and Super Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. But behind the scenes, the company had more up its sleeves. Developer presentations for Switch 2 took place behind closed doors, Eurogamer understands, with partners shown tech demos of how well the system is designed to run. 

One Switch 2 demo is a souped up version of Switch launch title Zelda: Breath of the Wild, designed to hit the Switch 2&#x27;s beefier target specs. (To be clear, though - this is just a tech demo. There&#x27;s no suggestion the game will be re-released.) Nintendo is yet to publicly discuss plans for its inevitable Switch successor, though its new hardware is widely-expected to launch at some point in 2024. Word that it is now being shown to external developers comes as details have begun to emerge around when we may see the system launch.

                              <span>Birmingham City Council, the largest local authority in Europe, has declared itself in financial distress after troubled Oracle project costs ballooned from $25 million to around $125.5 million. The Register reports: Contributing to the publication of a legal Section 114 Notice, which says the $4.3 billion revenue organization is unable to balance the books, is a bill of up to $954 million to settle equal pay claims. In a statement today, councillors John Cotton and Sharon Thompson, leader and deputy leader respectively, said the authority was also hit by financial stress owing to issues with the implementation of its Oracle IT system. The council has made a request to the Local Government Association for additional strategic support, the statement said.
 
In May, Birmingham City Council said it was set to pay up to $125.5 million for its Oracle ERP system -- potentially a fourfold increase on initial estimated expenses -- in a project suffering from delays, cost over-runs, and a lack of controls. After grappling with the project to replace SAP for core HR and finance functions since 2018, the council reviewed the plan in 2019, 2020, and again in 2021, when the total implementation cost for the project almost doubled to $48.5 million. The project, dubbed Financial and People, was &quot;crucial to an organisation of Birmingham City Council&#x27;s size,&quot; a spokesperson said at the time. Cotton said the system had a problem with how it was &quot;tracking our financial transactions and HR transactions issues as well. That&#x27;s got to be fixed,&quot; he said.
 
Earlier this year, one insider told The Register that Oracle Fusion, the cloud-based ERP system the council is moving to, &quot;is not a product that is suitable for local authorities, because it&#x27;s very much geared towards a manufacturing/trading organization.&quot; They said the previous SAP system had been heavily customized to meet the council&#x27;s needs and it was struggling to recreate these functions in Oracle.

And mostly, I look at people with a passionate preference and smile. Isn&#x27;t it great that people care so much about their craft that they volunteer to extol the benefits of their favorite tools! Yes it is, but there&#x27;s also a fine line between being a passionate evangelist and becoming a dogmatic crusader. And a sad but critical mass of the TypeScript faithful chose the latter in response to our decision to drop their beloved compiler from our project yesterday. It was at times a full-on meltdown. Yuck.
Now before we go into the particulars of this meltdown, it&#x27;s worth stating that there were also people with completely legitimate objections to dropping TypeScript…</span>

                              <span>In a press release today, the Federal Aviation Administration said UPS delivery drones are now allowed to fly longer distance flights beyond the sight of ground operators. &quot;This is the kind of move that opens the door for drone delivery companies like Wing, FedEx, and Zip to deliver packages across a wider area and service more customers,&quot; reports The Verge. From the report: UPS Flight Forward, a UPS subsidiary focused on drone delivery, can now deliver small packages beyond the visual line of sight (BVLOS) without spotters on the ground monitoring the route and skies for other aircraft, using SwissDrones SVO 50 V2 drones. The FAA also announced authorizations for two other companies to fly beyond sight for commercial purposes. That includes uAvionix Corp. and, last week, infrastructure inspection company Phoenix Air Unmanned.
 
UPS first received government approval to operate its drone service in 2019, the same year the FAA authorized Alphabet&#x27;s Wing service to operate commercially. The company first focused on building a drone delivery network for US hospital campuses.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from BleepingComputer: Toyota says a recent disruption of operations in Japan-based production plants was caused by its database servers running out of storage space. On August 29th, it was reported that Toyota had to halt operations on 12 of its 14 Japan-based car assembly plants due to an undefined system malfunction. As one of the largest automakers in the world, the situation caused production output losses of roughly 13,000 cars daily, threatening to impact exports to the global market.
 
In a statement released today on Toyota&#x27;s Japanese news portal, the company explains that the malfunction occurred during a planned IT systems maintenance event on August 27th, 2023. The planned maintenance was to organize the data and deletion of fragmented data in a database. However, as the storage was filled to capacity before the completion of the tasks, an error occurred, causing the system to shut down. This shutdown directly impacted the company&#x27;s production ordering system so that no production tasks could be planned and executed.
 
Toyota explains that its main servers and backup machines operate on the same system. Due to this, both systems faced the same failure, making a switchover impossible, inevitably leading to a halt in factory operations. The restoration came on August 29th, 2023, when Toyota&#x27;s IT team had prepared a larger capacity server to accept the data that was partially transferred two days back. This allowed Toyota&#x27;s engineers to restore the production ordering system and the plants to resume operations.

                              <span>Apple has been expanding its computing budget for building artificial intelligence to millions of dollars a day. The Information: One of its goals is to develop features such as one that allows iPhone customers to use simple voice commands to automate tasks involving multiple steps, according to people familiar with the effort. The technology, for instance, could allow someone to tell the Siri voice assistant on their phone to create a GIF using the last five photos they&#x27;ve taken and text it to a friend. Today, an iPhone user has to manually program the individual actions. 

The moves come four years after Apple&#x27;s head of AI, John Giannandrea, authorized the formation of a team to develop conversational AI, known as large-language models, before the technology became a focus of the software industry, according to people with knowledge of the team. That move now seems prescient following the launch last fall of ChatGPT, a chatbot that catalyzed a boom in language models. 

Although Giannandrea has repeatedly expressed skepticism to colleagues about the potential usefulness of chatbots powered by AI language models, the fact that Apple wasn&#x27;t completely unprepared for the language model boom could be considered an accomplishment -- and is the result of changes he made to the company&#x27;s software research culture, several colleagues said.

                              <span>The UK&#x27;s worst air-traffic outage in a decade was caused by an anomaly in the airspace manager&#x27;s software system, which confused two geographical checkpoints separated by some 4,000 nautical miles. From a report: The UK&#x27;s Civil Aviation Authority said Wednesday it will conduct an independent review of the incident, which forced hundreds of flights to be canceled or delayed last week after an error in processing an airline&#x27;s flight plan. The glitch triggered a shutdown of the software system run by NATS for safety reasons, according to a preliminary report from the public-private partnership formerly called National Air Traffic Services. This forced air-traffic staff to input flight plans manually, drastically reducing the amount of air traffic that could be processed. 

The event sent airlines and airports in the UK into turmoil on Aug. 28, leaving planes out of position and passengers stranded. Nearly 800 flights leaving UK airports were canceled, with a similar number of arrivals scrapped, according to analytics firm Cirium. The report by NATS showed that on the day of the incident, an airline entered a plan into the system which led through UK airspace. NATS Chief Executive Officer Martin Rolfe declined to discuss details of the flight, such as its route or the airline involved, saying the specifics weren&#x27;t pertinent to the outage. While the flight plan wasn&#x27;t faulty, it threw off the system because the software used by NATS received duplicate identities for two different points on the map. There are an infinite number of flight-plan waypoints in the world, and duplicates remain despite work to remove them, according to Rolfe.

                              <span>tlhIngan writes: Starfield, a Bethesda space-based RPG that was recently released, was criticized for not having Nvidia DLSS support -- instead the game was primarily written to feature AMD&#x27;s FSR support. This isn&#x27;t too surprising since the major consoles all use AMD processors and GPUs. However, an enterprising modder created a mod that enables players with Nvidia cards to enable DLSS. This isn&#x27;t the unusual bit -- the mod makes DLSS2 (ca. 2020) available for free, while the version enabling DLSS3 (which adds the ability to use AI to generate frames in-between) is behind a Patreon paywall. This has lead to several other people to crack the DRM protecting the mod itself (note: this is not the DRM on the game itself -- the game&#x27;s Steam page doesn&#x27;t seem to imply use of 3rd party DRM beyond Steam). Imagine that -- DRM on a game mod because it requires payment.

                              <span>YouTube is trying out games as its next experimental offering. The company is adding a new &quot;Playables&quot; section on the site that will include games that can be played on both the desktop website and mobile devices. From a report: Playables will only appear for &quot;a limited number of users to start,&quot; and there was no list of game titles published at this time. 9to5Google reports that one of the games to grace the new YouTube Playables experiment includes Stack Bounce, which involves a 3D ball bouncing on top of rings you must smash through with well-timed clicks. If you&#x27;ve heard of the game before, it&#x27;s because Google already offers it on its minigames service, GameSnacks.

                              <span>Roku will cut more than 300 staffers -- laying off 10% of its workforce -- as the streaming-platform company continues its battle to control costs. From a report: In addition, Roku will remove certain licensed and owned content from its platform as part of a &quot;strategic review of its content portfolio,&quot; resulting in an impairment charge of up to $65 million in the current quarter, the company disclosed in an SEC filing Wednesday. Other cost-cutting measures Roku outlined are consolidating office space and reducing outside services expenses. 

The goal is to reduce year-over-year operating expense growth rate, the company said. The layoffs represent Roku&#x27;s third round of job cuts in less than a year, after it pink-slipped 200 staffers in November 2022 and another 200 in March 2023. As of the end of 2022, Roku had approximately 3,600 full-time employees. The company, in addition to the layoffs, said it also plans to cut back on new hires.

                              <span>Slash_Account_Dot writes: An artificial intelligence company, whose founder Forbes included in a 30 Under 30 list recently, promises to use machine learning to convert clients&#x27; 2D illustrations into 3D models. In reality the company, called Kaedim, uses human artists for &#x27;quality control.&#x27; According to two sources with knowledge of the process interviewed by 404 Media, at one point, Kaedim often used human artists to make the models. One of the sources said workers at one point produced the 3D design wholecloth themselves without the help of machine learning at all. 

The news pulls back the curtain on a hyped startup and is an example of how AI companies can sometimes overstate the capabilities of their technology. Like other AI startups, Kaedim wants to use AI to do tedious labor that is currently being done by humans. In this case, 3D modeling, a time consuming job that video game companies are already outsourcing to studios in countries like China.

                              <span>The Pentagon is considering the development of a vast network of AI-powered technology, drones and autonomous systems within the next two years to counter threats from China and other adversaries. WSJ: Kathleen Hicks, the deputy secretary of defense, will provide new details in a speech later Wednesday about the department&#x27;s plans to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to develop an array of thousands of air-, land- and sea-based artificial-intelligence systems that are intended to be &quot;small, smart, cheap.&quot; 

The U.S. is seeking to keep pace with China&#x27;s rapidly expanding military amid concerns that the Pentagon bureaucracy takes too long to develop and deploy cutting-edge systems. [...] One approach could be to build on the capabilities demonstrated by Task Force 59, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s network of drones and sensors designed to monitor Iran&#x27;s military activities in the Middle East.

                              <span>The UK government will concede it will not use controversial powers in the online safety bill to scan messaging apps for harmful content until it is &quot;technically feasible&quot; to do so, postponing measures that critics say threaten users&#x27; privacy. Financial Times: A planned statement to the House of Lords on Wednesday afternoon will mark an eleventh-hour bid by ministers to end a stand-off with tech companies, including WhatsApp, that have threatened to pull their services from the UK over what they claimed was an intolerable threat to millions of users&#x27; security. The statement is set to outline that Ofcom, the tech regulator, will only require companies to scan their networks when a technology is developed that is capable of doing so, according to people briefed on the plan. Many security experts believe it could be years before any such technology is developed, if ever. 

&quot;A notice can only be issued where technically feasible and where technology has been accredited as meeting minimum standards of accuracy in detecting only child sexual abuse and exploitation content,&quot; the statement will say. The online safety bill, which has been in development for several years and is now in its final stages in parliament, is one of the toughest attempts by any government to make Big Tech companies responsible for the content that is shared on their networks.

                              <span>schwit1 writes: The Justice Department has spent three years over two presidential administrations building the case that Google illegally abused its power over online search to throttle competition. To defend itself, Google has enlisted hundreds of employees and three powerful law firms and spent millions of dollars on legal fees and lobbyists. On Tuesday, a judge in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia will begin considering their arguments at a trial that cuts to the heart of a long-simmering question: Did today&#x27;s tech giants become dominant by breaking the law? 

The case -- U.S. et al v. Google -- is the federal government&#x27;s first monopoly trial of the modern internet era, as a generation of tech companies has come to wield immense influence over commerce, information, public discourse, entertainment and labor. The trial moves the antitrust battle against those companies to a new phase, shifting from challenging their mergers and acquisitions to more deeply examining the businesses that thrust them into power. Such a consequential case over tech power has not unfolded since the Justice Department took Microsoft to court in 1998 for antitrust violations.

                              <span>By all accounts, TypeScript has been a big success for Microsoft. I&#x27;ve seen loads of people sparkle with joy from dousing JavaScript with explicit types that can be checked by a compiler. But I&#x27;ve never been a fan. Not after giving it five minutes, not after giving it five years. So it&#x27;s with great pleasure that I can announce we&#x27;re dropping TypeScript from the next big release of Turbo 8.
The fact is that I actually rather like JavaScript. I&#x27;d go so far as to say it&#x27;s my second favorite language after Ruby. Yes, a distant second, but a second none the less. This wasn&#x27;t always the case. But after we got proper classes in JavaScript, and all the other improvements that flowed since ES6, it&#x27;s become a real joy to write.
I still don&#x27;t think JavaScript is well-suited for most of the work we do…</span>

                              <span>According to Arm&#x27;s IPO documents, Apple has signed a new deal with the chipmaker for technology that &quot;extends beyond 2040.&quot; Reuters reports: Arm unveiled pricing on Tuesday for what it hopes will be a $52 billion initial public offering, which would be the largest such deal in the U.S. this year. Arm owner SoftBank plans to offer 95.5 million American depository shares of the United Kingdom-based company for $47 to $51 apiece, Arm said in a filing. Arm owns the intellectual property behind the computing architecture for most of the world&#x27;s smartphones, which it licenses to Apple and many others. Apple uses Arm&#x27;s technology in the processes of designing its own custom chips for its iPhones, iPads and Macs.
 
The two companies have a long history -- Apple was one of the initial companies that partnered to found the firm in 1990, before the release of its &quot;Newton&quot; handheld computer in 1993, which used an Arm-based processor chip. The Newton flopped, but Arm went on to become dominant in mobile phone chips because of its low power consumption, which helps batteries last longer. The deal disclosed on Tuesday was not mentioned in Arm&#x27;s previous IPO filing documents made public on Aug. 21, implying that the deal was signed between then and Sept. 5.

                              <span>Starting in December, Facebook users in the U.K., France and Germany will no longer see a dedicated section for news articles. CNBC reports: Meta said Tuesday that it is plans to &quot;deprecate&quot; the Facebook News tab in early December for users in those European countries as &quot;part of an ongoing effort to better align our investments to our products and services people value the most.&quot; The company added that it plans to spend more time and money on short-form video, as best exemplified by its TikTok-like Reels product.
 
News represents less than 3% of what people see in their Facebook feeds, Meta said. Meta said it would honor the Facebook News obligations it had made to publishers in those countries, but said it won&#x27;t enter into new deals and has no plans to offer new products for news publishers. In June, Meta removed all news content from Facebook and Instagram for users in Canada, following the passage of a bill requiring big tech companies to compensate news businesses when their content is made available on their services.

Now operating as a 501(c)(3) non-profit, the Museum of Classic Chicago Television has called YouTube home since 2007. However, copyright notices sent on behalf of Sony, protecting TV shows between 40 and 60 years old, could shut down the project in 48 hours. &quot;Our YouTube channel with 150k subscribers is in danger of being terminated by September 6th if I don&#x27;t find a way to resolve these copyright claims that Markscan made,&quot; Klein told TorrentFreak on Friday. &quot;At this point, I don&#x27;t even care if they were issued under authorization by Sony or not -- I just need to reach a live human being to try to resolve this without co…</span>

                              <span>Long-time Slashdot reader Mr_Blank shares a report from Axios: AI experts at leading universities favor creating a federal &quot;Department of AI&quot; or a global regulator to govern artificial intelligence over leaving that to Congress, the White House or the private sector. That&#x27;s the top-level finding of the new Axios-Generation Lab-Syracuse University AI Experts Survey of computer science professors from top U.S. research universities. The survey includes responses from 213 professors of computer science at 65 of the top 100 U.S. computer science programs, as defined by SCImago Journal rankings.
 
The survey found experts split over when or if AI will escape human control -- but unified in a view that the emerging technologies must be regulated. &quot;Regulation&quot; was the top response when asked what action would move AI in a positive direction. Just 1 in 6 said AI shouldn&#x27;t or can&#x27;t be regulated. Only a handful trust the private sector to self-regulate. About 1 in 5 predicted AI will &quot;definitely&quot; stay in human control. The rest were split between those saying AI will &quot;probably&quot; or &quot;definitely&quot; get out of human control and those saying &quot;probably not.&quot; &quot;No one individual is highly trusted to deal with AI issues,&quot; adds Axios. &quot;President Biden took the top spot, with 9% of respondents -- slightly higher than Sundar Pichai, Elon Musk or Sam Altman. Mark Zuckerberg and Donald Trump drew 2% and 1%, respectively.&quot;

                              <span>Apple will acquire the major Swedish classical music record label BIS Records, intending to fold it into Apple Music Classical and Platoon. MacRumors reports: BIS Records was founded in 1973 by Robert von Bahr. The label focuses on a range of classical music, with particular focus on works that are not well represented by existing recordings. It is an award-winning name in the world of classical music, acclaimed for its vast catalog and impressive audio quality. The label celebrates its 50th anniversary this week. The company announced its impending acquisition by Apple earlier today.
 
BIS is set to become a part of Apple Music Classical and the Apple-owned label Platoon. Apple acquired Platoon, a London-based A&amp;R startup focused on discovering rising music artists, in 2018. In 2021, Apple announced that it had purchased the classical music streaming service Primephonic and would be folding it into Apple Music via a new app dedicated to the genre. Apple released the Apple Music Classical app in March. The app offers a simpler interface for interacting with classical music specifically. Unlike the main Apple Music app, Apple Music Classical allows users to search by composer, work, conductor, catalog number, and more. Users can get more detailed information from editorial notes and descriptions.

Intel today said that it would provide foundry services and 300mm manufacturing capacity to Tower. As part of the deal, Tower would use Intel&#x27;s plant in New Mexico, operated by Intel Foundry Services (IFS), investing up to $300 million to &quot;acquire and own equipment and other fixed assets&quot; that would be installed in the manufacturing facility.
 
The deal will give Tower a new capacity corridor, it said, of &quot;over 600,000 photo layers per month&quot; to meet expected demand for 300mm chips. The deal will mean that Intel will be manufacturing Tower&#x27;s 65-nanometer pow…</span>

                              <span>Slash_Account_Dot writes: Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has told airports it plans to increase its targets for scanning passengers with facial recognition as they leave the U.S., according to an internal airport email obtained by 404 Media. The new goal will be to scan 75 percent of all passengers, the email adds. The news signals CBP&#x27;s increasing focus on biometric, and in particular facial recognition, systems at airports. Although it is unclear if related to the shift in goals, one traveler was also recently told by airline industry staff &quot;CBP said everyone has to do it&quot; when they asked to opt-out of facial recognition while boarding for an international flight last month.

                              <span>Israel&#x27;s prime minister on Sunday floated the idea of building infrastructure projects such as a fiber optic cable linking countries in Asia and the Arabian Peninsula with Europe through Israel and Cyprus. From a report: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he&#x27;s &quot;quite confident&quot; such an infrastructure &quot;corridor&quot; linking Asia to Europe through Israel and Cyprus is feasible. He said such projects could happen if Israel normalizes relations with other countries in the region. The 2020 U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords normalized relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, and the Biden administration is trying to establish official ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia. 

&quot;An example and the most obvious one is a fiber optic connection. That&#x27;s the shortest route. It&#x27;s the safest route. It&#x27;s the most economic route,&quot; Netanyahu said after talks with Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides. The Israeli leader&#x27;s pitch is itself an extension of proposed energy links with Cyprus and Greece as part of growing collaboration on energy in the wake of discoveries of significant natural gas deposits in the economic zones of both Israel and Cyprus.

                              <span>One million lorries of sand a day are being extracted from the world&#x27;s oceans, posing a &quot;significant&quot; threat to marine life and coastal communities facing rising sea levels and storms, according to the first-ever global data platform to monitor the industry. From a report: The new data platform, developed by the UN Environment Programme (Unep), tracks and monitors dredging of sand in the marine environment by using the AIS (automatic identification systems) data from ships. Using data from 2012-19, Marine Sand Watch estimates the dredging industry is digging up 6bn tonnes of marine sand a year, a scale described as &quot;alarming.&quot; The rate of extraction is growing globally, Unep said, and is approaching the natural rate of replenishment of 10bn to 16bn tonnes of sand flowing into the sea from rivers and needed to maintain coastal structure and ecosystems. 

The platform has identified &quot;hotspots&quot; including the North Sea, south-east Asia and the east coast of the United States as areas of concern. In many places where extraction is more intense, including parts of Asia, marine sand is being extracted well beyond the rate at which it is being replenished from rivers. [...] Developed by GRID-Geneva, a centre for analytics within Unep, Marine Sand Watch has trained artificial intelligence to identify the movement of dredging vessels from its AIS data. It has data from 2012-19 from Global Fishing Watch, a company set up to track commercial fishing activities using AIS data from fishing vessels, but is working on more recent data.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Meta Platforms&#x27; releases of its large-language models, Llama and Llama 2, in the past six months have won the company praise for offering free, open-source alternatives to models from OpenAI and Anthropic. But for some of the scientists and engineers who worked on Llama, that praise was too little, too late. Many have quit, embittered by a previously unreported internal battle over computing resources with another Meta research team working on a rival model that the company ultimately abandoned, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. 

Their departures are a reminder of the simmering tensions over shortages of computing power that both big and small tech companies are grappling with in developing generative AI, which requires specialized chips that aren&#x27;t freely available. Big tech firms have more computing resources than most, and some, like Meta, highlight that fact when recruiting AI researchers. But even they are limited in what they can supply. The exodus also highlights the challenges for big tech companies in retaining highly prized AI researchers as demand for AI talent surges. More than half the 14 authors of the original Llama research paper published in February have left the company, several for AI startups or other big companies, the people with direct knowledge said.

From a report: The software giant has started testing the changes to Windows 11 in recent test builds of the operating system, but the changes are restricted to countries within the European Economic Area (EEA). &quot;In the European Economic Area (EEA), Windows system components use the default browser to open links,&quot; reads a change note from a Windows 11 test build released to Dev Channel testers last month. Microsoft has been ignoring default browser choices in its search experience in Windows 10 and the taskbar widget that forces users into Edge if they click a link instead of their default browser. Windows 11 continued this trend, with search still forcing users into Edge and a new dedicated widgets area that also ignores the default browser setting.

                              <span>Apple is developing a low-cost MacBook series to compete with Chromebook models in the education sector that could be launched as early as the second half of 2024, claims a new report out of Taiwan. From a report: According to DigiTimes&#x27; industry sources, Apple will likely launch the new product line to differentiate it from the company&#x27;s existing MacBook Air and Pro lines. The outer appearance will still use a metal casing but will be made of &quot;different materials&quot; and the cost of the mechanical components will be lower, claims the report. The launch timeframe for the alleged new MacBook series appears to be based on a lack of related activity at major Apple suppliers like Quanta Computer and Foxconn, making a launch in the first half of next year unlikely.

                              <span>Julian Assange&#x27;s supporters will urge the US to drop the prosecution of the Australian citizen on the basis the &quot;very dangerous&quot; precedent will be exploited by China and Russia. From a report: Six Australian politicians are expected to focus on freedom-of-speech arguments when they fly to Washington DC later this month to warn against extraditing the WikiLeaks founder from the UK. The MPs and senators from across the political spectrum are aiming to help build momentum for the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, to raise the case in bilateral talks with Joe Biden at the White House in late October. The trip is being funded by the Assange campaign. 

Assange remains in Belmarsh prison in London as he fights a US attempt to extradite him to face charges in connection with the publication of hundreds of thousands of leaked documents about the Afghanistan and Iraq wars as well as diplomatic cables. Greg Barns SC, an adviser to the Assange campaign, said on Tuesday that it was &quot;not an ordinary run-of-the-mill extradition case.&quot; He said freedom of speech was &quot;an important theme in the US.&quot; 

&quot;You&#x27;ve got China chasing journalists around the world, and you&#x27;ve got the Russians who have recently arrested journalists,&quot; Barns told Guardian Australia. &quot;You&#x27;ve now got China using the Assange case as a sort of moral equivalence argument. So the message [of the Australian delegation] is going to be: this is very dangerous for journalists around the world and a race to the bottom that&#x27;s going on.&quot;

                              <span>More than 200 scientists have signed onto a letter pushing for &quot;responsible&quot; research into ways to trap planet-heating carbon dioxide in the world&#x27;s oceans. They want to take urgent action on the climate crisis, while making sure they don&#x27;t trigger any new problems by relying on oceans to help in the fight. From a report: Polluters have trashed the world&#x27;s atmosphere with carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels. That blanket of pollution is already warming the planet and causing more extreme weather disasters. One way to keep climate change from getting worse is to take some of those historic emissions out of the atmosphere. 

Oceans already do that for us, absorbing and holding around 50 times more carbon than the atmosphere. What if humans could supercharge that ability? That&#x27;s what scientists want to better understand, along with any side effects that might come with messing with the chemistry of our oceans. Startups are already developing new technologies to sequester more CO2 in the sea. But there&#x27;s still a lot we don&#x27;t know about what impact that might have or what strategies might be most successful, the letter says.

                              <span>More than 70 large artificial intelligence language models with over 1 billion parameters have been released in China, Baidu CEO Robin Li told an industry event in Beijing on Tuesday. From a report: Baidu joins several other Chinese companies that launched AI chatbots last week after securing regulatory approval for mass market releases. These include facial recognition firm SenseTime and AI startups Baichuan Intelligent Technology, Zhipu AI, and MiniMax. Li said the latest version of Baidu&#x27;s AI chatbot, Ernie 3.5, has processing speed twice that of the previous version with 50% improved efficiency. Li also revealed that Baidu will launch a new version in the near future.

                              <span>As a growing number of hackers target companies, organisations and industries with debilitating attacks, more skilled cyber security workers are urgently needed to combat the threat.ÂFrom a report: ISC2, the world&#x27;s largest association of cyber professionals, estimates that the cyber security workforce in 2022 stood at about 4.7mn people globally. But a further 3.4mn roles remain unfilled. &quot;The gap is massive,&quot; says Clar Rosso, ISC2&#x27;s chief executive. &quot;This shortfall is felt more acutely in countries such as India where digitisation is rapid. But even in the US, only 69 per cent of cyber roles are filled, according to Cyberseek, a website that provides data about the cyber security job market.&quot; 

Beyond a talent shortfall, existing workers are underskilled. A UK government report this year found that 50 per cent of UK businesses -- some 739,000 in total -- have a basic cyber skills gap, meaning that those in charge of cyber security lack the confidence to carry out the technical measures that protect against the most common digital attacks. Previously, it was thought that a company&#x27;s IT team could take care of all cyber security concerns. But &quot;over time, it became clear that this needed specialised attention,&quot; Rosso says, adding that, after some high-profile ransomware attacks over the past couple of years, &quot;business executives are now paying attention.&quot;

                              <span>The future of wearable technology, beyond now-standard accessories like smartwatches and fitness tracking rings, is ePANTS, according to the intelligence community. The Intercept: The federal government has shelled out at least $22 million in an effort to develop &quot;smart&quot; clothing that spies on the wearer and its surroundings. Similar to previous moonshot projects funded by military and intelligence agencies, the inspiration may have come from science fiction and superpowers, but the basic applications are on brand for the government: surveillance and data collection. Billed as the &quot;largest single investment to develop Active Smart Textiles,&quot; the SMART ePANTS -- Smart Electrically Powered and Networked Textile Systems -- program aims to develop clothing capable of recording audio, video, and geolocation data, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence announced in an August 22 press release. Garments slated for production include shirts, pants, socks, and underwear, all of which are intended to be washable. 

The project is being undertaken by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, the intelligence community&#x27;s secretive counterpart to the military&#x27;s better-known Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA. IARPA&#x27;s website says it &quot;invests federal funding into high-risk, high reward projects to address challenges facing the intelligence community.&quot; Its tolerance for risk has led to both impressive achievements, like a Nobel Prize awarded to physicist David Wineland for his research on quantum computing funded by IARPA, as well as costly failures. &quot;A lot of the IARPA and DARPA programs are like throwing spaghetti against the refrigerator,&quot; Annie Jacobsen, author of a book about DARPA, &quot;The Pentagon&#x27;s Brain,&quot; told The Intercept. &quot;It may or may not stick.&quot;

Medobed, an Indian startup that promises medicine delivery in 10 minutes, was initially selected in Y Combinator&#x27;s S23 batch. In recent weeks, Y Combinator has severed its ties with the Indian firm and a partner at the venture firm has also suggested many prospective investors to not engage with Medobed, according to two people familiar with the matter and a copy of an email obtained by TechCrunch. It&#x27;s very rare for Y Combinator, which selects a few hundred startups from tens of thousands of applications, to remove a firm from its coveted batch, the report adds.

Modern gaming consoles are forbidden on the grounds that they can connect to the internet, so the typical purchase is a Playstation 1. No version of Microsoft Windows more recent than Windows 98 is allowed. No device that can play MP3 files is allowed. The regulations forbid operating systems other than Microsoft DOS or Windows and any software capable of creating a program, such as a compiler as are &quot;database programs capable of altering or manipulating SQL databases&quot;. Although learning job skills is encouraged, programming is evidently not considered appropriate. The relationship of most of these restrictions to security is obscure.

                              <span>Microsoft has announced billing in public preview for Teams recording and transcription APIs, with pricing starting at 3 cents per minute for recordings. From a report: Getting meeting transcripts and recordings using Graph APIs is currently in public developer preview, so the billing, which started on September 1, might irk coders keen to use these features in their applications. The API for recording is billed at $0.03 per minute, and the API for transcription is $0.024 per minute. 

Microsoft cited line-of-business applications or ISV solutions in sales or HR as potential use cases for the technology, which permits recordings as an MP4 video file or transcripts as VTT files to be downloaded. VTT includes handy information such as the spoken words, timings, language, and the names of the speakers. A developer could automatically generate notes and attach meeting clips using one or both content API sets. Other information, such as sentiment and engagement metrics, could also be generated.

                              <span>A proposal to phase out CO2-emitting fossil fuels at COP27 last won backing from more than 80 countries but oil and gas-rich nations opposed it. European Union countries are preparing to push for a global deal on phasing out fossil fuels at the COP28 climate summit, a draft of the EU&#x27;s negotiating position has shown. From a report: Diplomats from the bloc&#x27;s 27 member states are drafting their position for the summit in Dubai in November, where nearly 200 countries will try to strengthen efforts to rein in climate change. &quot;The shift towards a climate neutral economy will require the global phase-out of [unabated] fossil fuels and a peak in their consumption already in the near term,&quot; a draft of the EU&#x27;s negotiating stance, seen by Reuters, says. 

Countries have never agreed in UN climate negotiations to gradually stop burning all CO2-emitting fossil fuels, despite this being the main cause of climate change. &quot;Unabated&quot; refers to fossil fuels burned without using technologies to capture the resulting CO2 emissions. The word was in brackets in the draft EU text, indicating that countries have not yet agreed on whether to include it. EU diplomats hope a deal can be made at COP28 - but expect to meet resistance from economies reliant on income from selling oil and gas.

                              <span>Invasive species are costing the world at least $423bn every year and have become a leading threat to the diversity of life on Earth, according to a UN assessment. From a news report: From invasive mice that eat seabird chicks in their nests to non-native grasses that helped fuel and intensify last month&#x27;s deadly fires in Hawaii, at least 3,500 harmful invasive species have been recorded globally in every region, spread by human travel and trade. Their impact is destructive for humans and wildlife, sometimes causing extinctions and permanently damaging the healthy functioning of an ecosystem. 

Leading scientists say the threat posed by invasive species is under appreciated, underestimated and sometimes unacknowledged, with more than 37,000 alien species now known to be introduced around the world and about 200 establishing themselves each year. While not all will become invasive, experts say there are significant tools to mitigate their spread and impact, protecting and restoring ecosystems in the process. 

&quot;Invasive alien species are a major threat to biodiversity and can cause irreversible damage to nature, including local and global species extinctions, and also threaten human wellbeing,&quot; wrote Prof Helen Roy, Prof Anibal Pauchard and Prof Peter Stoett, who led the research. &quot;It would be an extremely costly mistake to regard biological invasions only as someone else&#x27;s problem,&quot; said Pauchard. &quot;Although the specific species that inflict damage vary from place to place, these are risks and challenges with global roots but very local impacts facing people in every country, from all backgrounds and in every community -- even Antarctica is being affected.&quot;

                              <span>The London Stock Exchange Group has drawn up plans for a new digital markets business, saying this will make it the first major exchange to offer extensive trading of traditional financial assets on the blockchain technology best known for powering cryptocurrency. From a report: Murray Roos, head of capital&#x27;s markets at the LSE Group, told the Financial Times that the company had been examining the potential for a blockchain-powered trading venue for about a year, and had reached an &quot;inflection point&quot; where it had decided to take the plans forward. It has asked Julia Hoggett, head of the London Stock Exchange, one unit in the broader group, to spearhead the project. 

Roos stressed that his exchange was &quot;definitely not building anything around cryptoassets&quot; but was looking to use the technology that underpins popular tokens such as bitcoin to improve the efficiency of buying, selling and holding traditional assets. &quot;The idea is to use digital technology to make a process that is slicker, smoother, cheaper and more transparent and to have it regulated,&quot; Roos said. He added that LSEG had waited to proceed until it was sure that the public blockchain technology was &quot;good enough&quot; and that investors were ready.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: If Apple had its way, the iPhone would continue to use the current Lightning connector for the next few years -- until the point when the company is ready to begin phasing out ports on its smartphones altogether. But the European Union forced its hand, requiring mobile device makers to use the USB-C standard by the end of next year. So Apple is now in the awkward position of embracing the very technology it didn&#x27;t want. When the company introduces the iPhone 15 on Sept. 12, USB-C connectors will appear on its four new phone models, as well as the AirPods Pro, and Apple will describe it as a major win for customers. 

Customers will be able to use a single charging cable for iPhones, Macs and iPads. It will bring breakthrough data transfer speed increases for the new high-end iPhone models. Phones will charge faster in some instances. And, finally, the phones will be compatible with chargers used by billions of non-Apple devices. 

Why will Apple be so upbeat about a change it didn&#x27;t ask for? That&#x27;s because the company has an iron-clad rule: When it&#x27;s introducing a new product or dealing with the media, it always wants to operate from a position of strength. Apple&#x27;s keynote presentation won&#x27;t mention the European Union or make reference to the many times over the past few years that it criticized the government&#x27;s decision to require USB-C. Back when it was still resisting the switch, Apple laid out a few arguments, including that the change would harm the environment -- given that billions of obsolete cables may wind up in a landfill. Another rationale, floated by Apple marketing chief Greg Joswiak last year, is the potentially harmful precedent of governments influencing product design.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this report from the Washington Post:

On April 26, 1986, the infamous explosion at a Chernobyl nuclear power plant unleashed large amounts of radiation into the atmosphere, an event that contaminated wildlife across country lines. The radiation levels seen in animals as a result has decreased in recent years — with the exception of one animal: the wild boar. For years, scientists questioned why levels of a radioactive isotope known as cesium-137 have remained surprisingly high in wild boars rooting around Germany and Austria, while decreasing in other deer and roe deer. In a new study released last week, a team of researchers finally solved this &quot;wild boar paradox.&quot; 

They uncovered that the main radioactive source is not the Chernobyl accident but nuclear weapo…</span>

                              <span>&quot;Viasat Inc. has more than $1 billion of orbiting satellites in trouble,&quot; reports Bloomberg, &quot;and space insurers are girding for market-rattling claims.&quot;

The company&#x27;s roughly $1 billion ViaSat-3 Americas satellite, central to expanding its fixed-broadband coverage and fending off rivals including Elon Musk&#x27;s Starlink, suffered an unexpected problem as it deployed its antenna in orbit in April. Should Viasat declare it a total loss, industry executives estimate the claim would reach a record-breaking $420 million and, in turn, make it harder — and more expensive — for other satellite operators to get insurance... Viasat on Aug. 24 reported another stricken spacecraft, saying its Inmarsat-6 F2 satellite launched in February suffered a power problem. The failure may end the craft&#x27;s useful life and result in a $350 million insurance claim, Space Intel Report said. 

Viasat&#x27;s troubles in orbit come a few years after big-name insurers like American International Group Inc. and Allianz SE have shuttered their space portfolios. That&#x27;s left a smaller pool of providers to absorb the risks in the notoriously high-stakes $553 million market... 


Following news of the Inmarsat-6 anomaly, Viasat and other industry participants &quot;will likely experience significant challenges with obtaining insurance for future satellite launches,&quot; [investment banking firm] William Blair&#x27;s Louie DiPalma said in an Aug. 25 note... In 2019, the total losses from satellite claims amounted to $788 million, which overwhelmed the total premiums for the year at $500 million, according to launch and satellite database Seradata. In the years that followed, big names like American International Group Inc., Swiss Re AG, and Allianz SE all closed the door on satellite insurance. 
Earlier this month Viasat&#x27;s CEO says before deciding whether they&#x27;ll file a claim, &quot;There&#x27;s no consequences to us taking another couple or three months to get good measurements and then making those decisions.&quot;

By default cargo audit checks on your Cargo.lock file, but it can also scan compiled binaries. You can install cargo-audit and run it against your project with the following commands:
$ cargo install cargo-audit
$ cargo audit

Both cargo audit and the RustSec advisory database that powers it are maintained by the Rust Secure Code working group.
What&#x27;s new in this release
Performance
cargo audit now uses the sparse crates.io index when checking for yanked crates. This dramatically speeds up the scanning process because cargo audit no longer needs to download the entire crates.io index, which could take up to several minutes.
Sparse index is used by default if you are running Rust 1.70 or later, same as in Carg…</span>

2015: Philadelphia
I first tried to organize a meetup in Philly in 2015. I was
contracting at the time and I figured a meetup might be a good way to
source contracts or just meet interesting people. I created the
&quot;Philadelphia Software in Business&quot; (or some other similarly vaguely
named) group on Meetup.com.
I didn&#x27;t have any network; the first companies I worked for were not
in Philly. But Meetup.com got me a few tens of people joining the
group.
My first challenge was finding a place to meet. I didn&#x27;t know what I

                              <span>CBS News reports:
Floridians battered by Hurricane Idalia this week may not have expected another threat — that floodwaters could cause their cars to suddenly burst into flames. Yet that&#x27;s exactly what happened when two electric vehicles caught fire after being submerged in saltwater churned up by the storm... 

&quot;If you own a hybrid or electric vehicle that has come into contact with saltwater due to recent flooding within the last 24 hours, it is crucial to relocate the vehicle from your garage without delay,&quot; the fire department said in a Facebook post. &quot;Saltwater exposure can trigger combustion in lithium-ion batteries. If possible, transfer your vehicle to higher ground.&quot; The warning also applies to electric golf carts, scooters and bicycles, with lithium-ion batteries potentially sparking a fire when they get wet. More specifically, salt residue remains after the water dries out and can create &quot;bridges&quot; between the battery&#x27;s cells, potentially creating electrical connections that can spark a fire. 
Fire crews were actually towing one of the vehicles when it burst into flames, the article points out. And EV manufacturers want people to take the possibility seriously:

Tesla warns car owners about the risks of vehicle submersion and advises against driving a car that has been flooded. &quot;Treat your vehicle as if it has been in an accident and contact your insurance company,&quot; the company says in its guidance for handling a submerged vehicle.

                              <span>CNN reports that newspaper chain Gannett &quot;has paused the use of an AI tool to write high school sports dispatches after the technology made several major flubs in articles in at least one of its papers.&quot;
In one notable example, preserved by the Internet Archive&#x27;s Wayback Machine, the story began: &quot;The Worthington Christian [[WINNING_TEAM_MASCOT]] defeated the Westerville North [[LOSING_TEAM_MASCOT]] 2-1 in an Ohio boys soccer game on Saturday....&quot; The reports were mocked on social media for being repetitive, lacking key details, using odd language and generally sounding like they&#x27;d been written by a computer with no actual knowledge of sports. 

CNN identified several other local Gannett outlets, including the Louisville Courrier Journal, AZ Central, Florida Today and the Milwaukee Journal…</span>

                              <span>The BBC has an article about Japan&#x27;s release into the sea of treated waste water from the damaged Fukushima nuclear plant. &quot;Scientists largely agree that the impact will be negligible, but China has strongly protested the release. And disinformation has only fuelled fear and suspicion in China.&quot;

A report by a UK-based data analysis company called Logically, which aims to fight misinformation, claims that since January, the Chinese government and state media have been running a coordinated disinformation campaign targeting the release of the waste water. As part of this, mainstream news outlets in China have continually questioned the science behind the nuclear waste water discharge. The rhetoric has only increased since the water was released on 24 August, stoking public anger... Japan&#x27;s foreign ministry even warned its citizens in China to be cautious and to avoid speaking Japanese loudly in public... 

Logically&#x27;s data also showed that, since the beginning of the year, state-owned media have run paid ads on Facebook and Instagram, without disclaimers, about the risks of the waste water release in multiple countries and languages, including English, German, and Khmer. &quot;It is quite evident that this is politically motivated,&quot; Hamsini Hariharan, a China expert at Logically, told the BBC. She added that misleading content from sources related to the Chinese government had intensified the public outcry... 

Dozens of posts on Chinese social media Weibo showed panicked crowds buying giant sacks of salt ahead of the Fukushima water release. Some worried that future supply would be contaminated. Others believed — falsely — that salt protected them against radiation. A restaurant in Shanghai, in an apparent effort to profit off the hysteria, advertised &quot;anti-radiation&quot; meals with errant claims of reducing skin damage and cell regeneration. A social media user asked wryly, &quot;Why would I pay 28 yuan for tomato with seasoning?&quot;

After years of ducking scrutiny, Jan Sramek, the former Goldman Sachs trader spearheading the effort, launched a website Thursday about &quot;California Forever.&quot; The site billed the project as &quot;a chance for a new community, good paying local jobs, solar farms, and open space&quot; in Solano, a rural county between San Francisco and Sacramento that is now home to 450,000 people.

                              <span>&quot;Two stalled driverless taxis blocked an ambulance carrying a critically injured patient,&quot; writes the San Francisco Chronicle, citing a paywalled report from Forbes. The delay &quot;contributed to &#x27;poor patient outcome&#x27; — the person died 20 to 30 minutes after reaching the hospital, according to a report by San Francisco firefighters that the taxi company disputes.&quot; 

The report was obtained by Forbes, which recently published a story detailing accounts by San Francisco firefighters who say driverless taxis have repeatedly interfered with their emergency response. However, Forbes also reported that Cruise provided a video that disputed SFFD&#x27;s account of the August 14 incident. The video, Forbes reported, shows that one Cruise car quickly left the scene while the other remained stalled at the intersection with an open lane to its right, which traffic was passing through. Forbes said it was not clear from the video if the ambulance could have navigated into the open lane. 

Hannah Lindow, a Cruise spokesperson, told the Chronicle that the Cruise vehicle that stopped did so to yield to first responders directing traffic. &quot;Throughout the entire duration the (autonomous vehicle) is stopped, traffic remains unblocked and flowing to the right of the AV. The ambulance behind the AV had a clear path to pass the AV as other vehicles, including another ambulance, proceeded to do,&quot; Lindow said in an email. &quot;As soon as the victim was loaded into the ambulance, the ambulance left the scene immediately and was never impeded from doing so by the AV.&quot;

                              <span>To complete one full rotation around its axis it takes the moon 655 hours. So a single &quot;lunar day&quot; is 13.64 earth days. 

But sunset has finally come for India&#x27;s Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft and its Pragyan rover, writes long-time Slashdot reader Geoffrey.landis , and the rover has switched off for the coming 655-hour night:
With luck from the moon gods, it will wake up with the sunrise in 14 days. But, even if not, mission accomplished! It was designed for fourteen days of operation, the daylight period. In that time the rover accomplished just over a hundred meters (American units: one football field) of traverse, examining and chemically analyzing the surface. 


&quot;The Indian Express newspaper said the electronics on board the Indian moon mission werenâ(TM)t designed to withstand very low temperatures, less than -120 C (-184 F) during the nighttime on the moon,&quot; according to the Associated Press. But the rover&#x27;s accomplishments already include making the first-ever measurements of the south pole&#x27;s near-surface Lunar plasma, and confirming the presence of aluminum, calcium, chromium, titanium, manganese, and silicon. There&#x27;s also sulphur, iron, oxygen and other elements on the moon, Reuters reports, citing a statement from the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO):

The Pragyan rover from the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft was &quot;set into Sleep mode&quot; but with batteries charged and receiver on, the ISRO said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, late on Saturday. &quot;Hoping for a successful awakening for another set of assignments!&quot; ISRO said. &quot;Else, it will forever stay there as India&#x27;s lunar ambassador.&quot; 



Earlier this week the ISRO posted footage of the rover completing a near-pirouette to search for the safest route. 

&quot;The solar panel is oriented to receive the light at the next sunrise expected on September 22, 2023,&quot; the ISRO posted Saturday.

                              <span>&quot;Microsoft has quietly revealed that WordPad, the basic word processor that&#x27;s been included with Windows since 1995, is being retired,&quot; reports Windows blog Paul Thurrott:
&quot;WordPad is no longer being updated and will be removed in a future release of Windows,&quot; the Deprecated features for Windows client page on Microsoft Learn notes in a September 1, 2023 addition. &quot;We recommend Microsoft Word for rich text documents like .doc and .rtf and Windows Notepad for plain text documents like .txt....&quot; 

[W]hile Microsoft&#x27;s advice to use Microsoft Word instead seems a bit off-base, given that Word is a paid product, RTF is rarely used these days, and anyone can access the web versions of Word for free if needed. 

The actual date of removal is unclear. But Neowinisn&#x27;t the only thing Microsoft is removing from Windows:
The company recently turned off Cortana, its neglected voice assistant, and announced the end of Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT). Also, Microsoft will soon disable old Transport Layer Security protocols to make Windows 11 more secure.

Interestingly, macOS dipped by 0.27% to 1.57% while Windows rose by 0.4% to 96.61%. For those wondering why the Steam Linux numbers dropped while the Steam Deck continues to be very popular, it&#x27;s possibly again another month impacted by large swings in Chinese traffic... SteamOS Holo that powers the Steam Deck gained another 2% marketshare to now commanding around 44% of the reported Linux gamers. 

Among Linux gamers, AMD CPUs power around 71% of the systems. In part due to the Steam Deck being powered by an AMD APU. Meanwhile Steam on Windows has the AMD CPU marketshare at around 33%.

                              <span>Vanity Fair revisits the many warning signs about OceanGate&#x27;s Titan submersible prior to an implosion on June 18th that killed all five passengers onboard. 


A professional expedition leader tells their reporter that &quot;This tragedy was predicted. It was avoidable. It was inevitable.&quot;

As the world now knows, Stockton Rush touted himself as a maverick, a disrupter, a breaker of rules. So far out on the visionary curve that, for him, safety regulations were mere suggestions. &quot;If you&#x27;re not breaking things, you&#x27;re not innovating,&quot; he declared at the 2022 GeekWire Summit. &quot;If you&#x27;re operating within a known environment, as most submersible manufacturers do, they don&#x27;t break things. To me, the more stuff you&#x27;ve broken, the more innovative you&#x27;ve been.&quot; In a culture that has adopted the ridiculo…</span>

                              <span>Santiago Valdarrama teaches machine learning. He posted this week on Twitter and LinkedIn that &quot;Scrum is a cancer.&quot; Some highlights:
I&#x27;ve been writing software for 25 years, and nothing renders a software team useless like Scrum does... We spent more time talking than doing... We spent more time estimating story points than writing software... Imagine having a manager, a scrum master, a product owner, and a tech lead. You had to answer to all of them and none simultaneously... 

I believe in Agile, but this ain&#x27;t agile... The result was always the same: It didn&#x27;t work. Scrum is a cancer that will eat your development team. Scrum is not for developers; it&#x27;s another tool for managers to feel they are in control. 

DevOps.com shares some reactions, including the developer who calls Scrum &quot;a life-sucking batch of meetings that are good for one thing: Taking developers who can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t want to see the overall business/architecture picture and getting useful work out of them.&quot; 

But later in the week, Valdarrama revisited the issue with a follow-up post. &quot;After 3,400 replies, I learned a few things.&quot;
First, the most common jobs among the people who told me I was wrong were &quot;Agile Coach&quot; and &quot;Scrum Master....&quot; 
Second, Scrum can&#x27;t fail because Scrum is whatever you want Scrum to be. There&#x27;s no right way to do Scrum, so if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, you aren&#x27;t as bright as you thought you were. 

Third, Scrum isn&#x27;t agile, except when it is. But it&#x27;s much better than Waterfall, except when it isn&#x27;t. And it&#x27;s better than nothing and everything at the same time. 

Fourth, many people got triggered by my comparison of Scrum and communism... 

Finally, by far, most people hate Scrum with passion.

Now the photos along with her name and contact information were on 4chan, a lawless website that allows users to post anonymously about topics as varied as music and white supremacy... Facebook users registered under fake names such as &quot;Joe Bummer&quot; sent her direct messages demanding that she send new, explicit photos, or else they would further spread the already leaked photos. Some pictures landed in her father&#x27;s Instagram messages, while marketing clients told her about the nude images that came their way. Madison was at a friend&#x27;s party when she got…</span>

                              <span>&quot;Are you old enough to remember channel surfing?&quot; asks long-time Slashdog reader MightyMait. &quot;When there were only a handful of broadcast channels, it wasn&#x27;t a big deal...&quot;

But when we got cable/satelite, one could spend inordinate amounts of time flipping through the channels looking for something decent to watch. Now, with the proliferation of streaming services... 

Streaming viewers are now &quot;spending a record 10.5 minutes per session deciding what to watch,&quot; according to TV Tech, citing a new study from the Nielsen-owned entertainment-data company Gracenote. 

Their 2023 State of Play report &quot;found that that there were 1.9 million video titles available to viewers in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Mexico and Germany in July 2021, a number that had swelled to 2.7 million titles by June 2023.&quot;
Of the total count, a whopping 86.7% were available on streaming services. Compounding complexity, many popular shows now appear in multiple streaming catalogs, as the industry pivots from offering content exclusivity to broad distribution strategies that companies hope will balance massive streaming loses, the report noted. The Gracenote analysis also found that audiences now have nearly 40,000 individual FAST channels, streaming providers and aggregators to choose from. 

The original submission from MightyMait asks Slashdot readers: &quot;Are you feeling the pain? And if so, &quot;What strategies do you employ to avoid this time suck?&quot; 
Share your own thoughts and experiences in the comments. And do streamers spend more time deciding what to watch?

                              <span>Slashdot reader martiniturbide writes: ArcaOS 5.1.0 is an OEM distribution of IBM&#x27;s discontinued OS/2 Warp operating system. This new version of ArcaOS offers UEFI compatibility allowing it to run in modern x86 hardware and also includes the ability to install to GPT-based disk layouts. 

At OS2World the OS/2 community has been called upon to report supported hardware, open source any OS/2 software, make public as much OS/2 documentation as possible and post the important platform links. OS2World insists that open source has helped OS/2 in the past years and it is time to look under the hood to try to clone internal components like Control Program, Presentation Manager, SOM and Workplace Shell.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares The Hill&#x27;s report from earlier this month. Apparently America&#x27;s tax-collecting Internal Revenue Service &quot;cannot locate thousands of microfilm cartridges containing millions of sensitive individual and business tax account records, according to a watchdog report.&quot;

The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration said in a report released August 8 that the IRS cannot account for microfilm cartridges — which contain backups of tax records as required under federal law — from fiscal 2010 that were originally stored at a processing center in Fresno, California... The watchdog also found seven empty boxes, which could hold up to 168 cartridges total, at the Ogden Tax Processing Center in Utah. Ogden personnel did not know where the missing cartridges were. 

More than 4,000 cartridges containing business tax account information from fiscal 2018 and 4,500 cartridges containing individual tax account information from fiscal 2019 also could not be accounted for at the Kansas City facility, according to the report. 

&quot;The personal taxpayer and tax information included on these backup cartridges is key information that can be used to commit tax refund fraud identity theft,&quot; the report noted.

                              <span>&quot;Generally you may not carry a concealed firearm on your person in public,&quot; warns a California government web site, &quot;unless you have a valid Carry Concealed Weapon (CCW) license.&quot; And a California appellate court associated justice writes that in the county where Apple is located, &quot;the Santa Clara County Sheriff&#x27;s Office rarely issued CCW licenses.&quot; 

This has led to Thomas Moyer, Apple&#x27;s head of global security, facing bribery charges, reports Reason&#x27;s legal blog, the Volokh Conspiracy. According to the judge&#x27;s statement (citing the case of the public defender)...

...the Santa Clara County undersheriff requested — and defendant Thomas Moyer made — a promise to donate iPads to the Santa Clara County Sheriff&#x27;s Office in exchange for releasing concealed carry weapon licenses that the sheriff had signed. Consistent with the Ninth Circuit&#x27;s interpretation of California law, federal law and the law in many states, we conclude that such a promise may constitute a bribe. We also conclude that the evidence presented to the grand jury was sufficient to raise a reasonable suspicion of such bribery. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court&#x27;s order dismissing the bribery count against Moyer, reinstate that count, and remand for further proceedings.

                              <span>What caused Monday&#x27;s glitch in the UK&#x27;s air traffic control system that left thousands of passengers stranded? 

Wednesday the Independent reported that it may have been triggered by &quot;an incorrectly filed flight plan by a French airline.&quot;

Several sources say the issue may have been caused when a French airline filed a dodgy flight plan that made no digital sense. Instead of the error being rejected, it prompted a shutdown of the entire National Air Traffic Services (Nats) system — raising questions over how one clerical error could cause such mayhem... Downing Street has launched an independent review into the incident, which caused more than a quarter of flights at UK airports to be cancelled on Monday... 

In his statement, Nats chief executive Martin Rolfe said Nats&#x27; systems, both primary and the back-ups, responded to the incorrect flight data by suspending automatic processing &quot;to ensure that no incorrect safety-related information could be presented to an air traffic controller or impact the rest of the air traffic system&quot;. 

The article also points out that &quot;Passengers hit by the air traffic control meltdown face being stranded abroad for up to a week.&quot;

Around 300,000 airline passengers have now been hit by flight cancellations since the hours-long failure of the Nats system on bank holiday Monday. The knock-on effect is set to last for several more days, as under-pressure airlines battle the backlog in a week where millions are already returning to the UK from their summer holidays.

Germany &quot;ultimately completed its nuclear exit in April 2023,&quot; while France &quot;has the highest share of nuclear in the energy mix of any country in the world.&quot;


[A] major concern is that more nuclear means less renewables, at a time when wind and solar need all the scale they can get... In a joint attempt to provide greater technical clarity on the nuclear power debate, French think tank IDDRI and German Agora Energiewende set out in 2018 to understand how nuclear energy will influence the transformation of energy systems in both countries.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this report from cybersecurity blogger Brian Krebs:

Domain names ending in &quot;.US&quot; — the top-level domain for the United States — are among the most prevalent in phishing scams, new research shows. This is noteworthy because .US is overseen by the U.S. government, which is frequently the target of phishing domains ending in .US. Also, .US domains are only supposed to be available to U.S. citizens and to those who can demonstrate that they have a physical presence in the United States... [F]ew other major countries in the world have anywhere near as many phishing domains each year as .US. 

That&#x27;s according to The Interisle Consulting Group, which gathers phishing data from multiple industry sources and publishes an annual report on the latest trends. Interisle&#x27;s newest study examined six million phishing reports between May 1, 2022 and April 30, 2023, and found 30,000 .US phishing domains. 

.US is overseen by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), an executive branch agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce. However, NTIA currently contracts out the management of the .US domain to GoDaddy, by far the world&#x27;s largest domain registrar. Under NTIA regulations, the administrator of the .US registry must take certain steps to verify that their customers actually reside in the United States, or own organizations based in the U.S. But Interisle found that whatever GoDaddy was doing to manage that vetting process wasn&#x27;t working.

                              <span>The Verge argues we&#x27;re seeing &quot;the end of the Googleverse. For two decades, Google Search was the invisible force that determined the ebb and flow of online content. 

&quot;Now, for the first time, its cultural relevance is in question... all around us are signs that the era of &#x27;peak Google&#x27; is ending or, possibly, already over.&quot;

There is a growing chorus of complaints that Google is not as accurate, as competent, as dedicated to search as it once was. The rise of massive closed algorithmic social networks like Meta&#x27;s Facebook and Instagram began eating the web in the 2010s. 	More recently, there&#x27;s been a shift to entertainment-based video feeds like TikTok — which is now being used as a primary search engine by a new generation of internet users...

                              <span>Kotaku reports that last week 29-year old Darin Harris &quot;allegedly stole dozens of copies of the game from a warehouse and started selling them online,&quot; prompting lots of pre-release leaks for the game. 

&quot;One Reddit user immediately reported the leaks to Bethesda and Memphis police,&quot; adds Kotaku. &quot;And he&#x27;s now been banned from the r/GamingLeaksAndRumours subreddit after posting about it.&quot;

I know this because the commenter in question, Jasper Adkins, emailed Kotaku to inform us it had happened. &quot;It seems to me that the subreddit is running on &#x27;bread and circuses&#x27; mode mixed with bystander syndrome,&quot; he wrote in his initial email. &quot;They&#x27;re perfectly willing to ignore a crime that hurts a developer they claim to support, in exchange for a few minutes of shaky gameplay filmed from a phone....…</span>

The implanted neurons are designed to produce dopamine, which is deficient in Parkinson&#x27;s patients, and early data suggests they may have survived and improved symptoms in some cases. MIT Technology Review reports: The study is one of the largest and most costly tests yet of embryonic-stem-cell technology, the controversial and much-hyped approach of using stem cells taken from IVF embryos to produce replacement tissue and body parts. The replacement neurons were manufactured using powerful stem cells originally sourced from a human embryo created an in vitro fertilization procedure.

                              <span>The U.S. Department of Defense has launched a website collecting publicly available, declassified information on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs). &quot;For now, the general public will be able to read through the posted information,&quot; reports CNET. &quot;Soon, US government employees, contractors, and service members with knowledge of US programs can report their own sightings, and later, others will be able to submit reports.&quot; From the report: &quot;This website will provide information, including photos and videos, on resolved UAP cases as they are declassified and approved for public release,&quot; the department said in a release posted on Thursday. &quot;The website&#x27;s other content includes reporting trends and a frequently asked questions section as well as links to official reports, transcripts, press releases, and other resources that the public may find useful, such as applicable statutes and aircraft, balloon and satellite tracking sites.&quot;
 
For now, one of the most interesting parts of the site is its trends section. Apparently, most reported UAPs are round, either white, silver or translucent, spotted at around 10,000 to 30,000 feet, 1-4 meters in size, and do not emit thermal exhaust. Hotspots for sightings include both the US East and West coasts. There&#x27;s also a small section of videos with names such as &quot;DVIDS Video - Unresolved Case: Navy 2021 Flyby,&quot; and &quot;UAP Video: Middle East Object.&quot; Readers are able to leave comments on the videos. Of the &quot;Middle East Object&quot; video, one person writes,&quot;Noticed I never saw it cast a shadow. But other objects have shadows.&quot;

A genomics analysis of more than 3,000 living people suggested that our ancestors&#x27; total population plummeted to about 1,280 breeding individuals for about 117,000 years. Scientists believe that an extreme climate event could have led to the bottleneck that came close to wiping out our ancestral line. &quot;The numbers that emerge from our study correspond to those of species that are currently at risk of extinction,&quot; said Prof Giorgio Manzi, an anthropologist at Sapienza University of Rome and a senior author of the research.

                              <span>&quot;The NYC police department intends to use drones to monitor Labor Day backyard parties, raising privacy concerns,&quot; writes Slashdot reader jjslash. &quot;Drone usage by U.S. police departments is increasing, with some operating them beyond visual line of sight. TechSpot reports: &quot;If a caller states there&#x27;s a large crowd, a large party in a backyard, we&#x27;re going to be utilizing our assets to go up and go check on the party,&quot; said assistant NYPD Commissioner Kaz Daughtry at a recent press conference. Naturally, the admission attracted the attention of privacy and civil liberties advocates who questioned if the department&#x27;s plans violate existing laws governing surveillance in the area.
 
In its unmanned aircraft systems (UAS): Impact and use policy from 2021, the NYC police department said drones would not be used in areas where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy without a search warrant, except in exigent circumstances (PDF). Are backyard parties really all that pressing? &quot;Deploying drones in this way is a sci-fi inspired scenario,&quot; said Daniel Schwarz, a technology and privacy strategist with the New York Civil Liberties Union. Schwarz added that it is at variance with the Public Oversight of Surveillance Technology (POST) Act, which &quot;requires the reporting and evaluation of surveillance technologies used by the NYPD.&quot;

                              <span>Microsoft has patented an AI-powered backpack design featuring a plethora of sensors that may include cameras, microphones, GPS, and a compass. Tom&#x27;s Hardware reports: Additionally, Microsoft thinks it may be useful to add in LEDs and speakers, as well as a haptic actuator, into the straps. Some real-time processing is deemed necessary to the smart wearable. Thus, various recognition modules are proposed to provide image, text, speech, facial, and cognitive recognition. As well as real-time monitors feeding data to the built-in processing power for AI smarts, the system housed in the backpack also will boast a recording device (using on-board storage), wireless connectivity, battery power / charging and more.
 
With all the above sensing and processing on your person, in the backpack, it is envisioned that wearers will benefit from AI enhanced object identification and analysis, nearby device interaction, and be able to gain contextual insights. A flow chart shows how the backpack and its data feed might work alongside personal computers and cloud servers. Other illustrations show the wandering backpack wearer navigating a ski resort, and checking out supermarket prices, as well as considering booking concert tickets. Sometimes the user may interact with the backpack&#x27;s on-board AI via speech, e.g. &quot;Hey Backpack, add this poster to my calendar.&quot; Alternatively some AI actions or contextual tasks may be instigated by interacting with sensors on the straps. You can view the patent application here.

Sal Khan, academy founder, said Caltech&#x27;s action is a &quot;huge deal&quot; for equitable access to college. While Caltech is small -- only 2,400 students, about 40% of them undergraduates -- Khan said he hoped its prestigious reputation would encourage other institutions to examine their admission barriers and find creative solutions to ease them.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from ExtremeTech: Slowly but surely, sales of electric cars have crept upward as traditional automakers finally embrace EVs. Nissan was early to the electric future with the venerable if modest Leaf. Nissan is now looking to turn old Leafs into something new by harvesting their batteries. The company has begun selling portable power banks built around refurbished automotive batteries, which could give these expensive Leaf cells a new lease on life. The Lithium-ion cells in vehicles have the same properties as the battery in your phone. They start out with a specific power rating, but successive discharge-recharge cycles cause physical stress to the internal structure. Eventually, this results in reduced capacity and voltage. However, Nissan says most Leaf owners stop driving the car before the battery stops working. In fact, many of the individual cells are still in good shape when the vehicles are discarded.
 
Each Nissan Leaf has around 48 lithium-ion battery modules -- the exact number depends on model. While some may be in poor shape at the end of a car&#x27;s life, Nissan has taken to disassembling the battery packs to refurbish working modules. The result is the Nissan portable power station, which was developed in partnership with JVCKenwood Corp. and 4R Energy Corp. The bulky 32-pound portable chargers contain two Leaf battery modules with about 80% of their original capacity intact. They&#x27;re no longer suitable for driving an EV, but they can still charge your phone. Nissan sells the battery packs in Japan for 170,500 yen (about $1,170). That might sound like a lot, but it&#x27;s actually not bad for a super high-capacity battery pack. Each of Nissan&#x27;s current-gen battery modules is 1.67 kWh, which converts to 112 Ah (112,000 mAh). Assuming a 20% loss in capacity, two of them would have enough juice to charge the largest current iPhone more than 40 times.

                              <span>Lenovo&#x27;s upcoming 27-inch 4K monitor offers a unique experience unlike any other display: glasses-free 3D that can be toggled on and off. According to Ars Technica, the monitor features a lenticular lens and real-time eye-tracking to create the effect. It&#x27;s being targeted at content creators, like 3D graphic designers and developers. From the report: Like other glasses-less 3D screens, [Lenovo&#x27;s ThinkVision 27 3D Monitor] works by projecting two different images to each of your eyes, resulting in a 3D effect where, as PR images would have you believe, it appears that the images are popping out of the screen. Lenovo says the monitor&#x27;s 3D resolution is 1920x2160. The lenticular lens in the monitor is switchable, allowing for normal, 2D viewing at 3840x2160, too. The ThinkVision&#x27;s 27-inch display gives workers a bigger palette. It also means the monitor can be a regular 2D monitor when needed. [...]
 
As a regular 2D monitor, the ThinkVision&#x27;s specs are pretty standard. It&#x27;s a 4K IPS screen claiming a 60 Hz refresh rate, 310 nits, a 1,000:1 contrast ratio, and 99 percent DCI-P3 and Adobe RGB color coverage with a Delta E under 2. Like a proper workplace monitor, there&#x27;s also a strong port selection: two HDMI 2.1, one DisplayPort 1.4, four USB-A (3.1 Gen 1) ports, one USB-C port (3.2 Gen 1) with up to 15 W power delivery, RJ45, a 3.5mm jack, plus an upstream USB-C port with up to 100 W power delivery.

                              <span>Robinhood announced it has purchased more than 55 million shares of the firm previously held by former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, which were seized in January by the U.S. Department of Justice as part of the criminal case against FTX and its executives. CoinTelegraph reports: The purchase had been expected. Robinhood&#x27;s board of directors announced the approval of the deal in the company&#x27;s Q4 2022 report, and an Aug. 30 SEC filing said the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York had approved the purchase &quot;free and clear of any claims, interests, liens and encumbrances.&quot; Robinhood made the repurchase agreement with the U.S. Marshals Service. &quot;We are happy to have completed the purchase of these shares and look forward to executing on our growth plans on behalf of our customers and shareholders,&quot; said Robinhood chief financial officer Jason Warnick.

                              <span>Samsung today revealed the world&#x27;s first 32 Gb DDR5 DRAM die. From a report: The new memory die is made on the company&#x27;s 12 nm-class DRAM fabrication process and not only offers increased density, but also lowers power consumption. The chip will allow Samsung to build record 1 TB RDIMMs for servers as well as lower costs of high-capacity memory modules. &quot;With our 12nm-class 32 Gb DRAM, we have secured a solution that will enable DRAM modules of up to 1 TB, allowing us to be ideally positioned to serve the growing need for high-capacity DRAM in the era of AI (Artificial Intelligence) and big data,&quot; said SangJoon Hwang, executive vice president of DRAM product &amp; technology at Samsung Electronics. 

32 Gb memory dies not only enable Samsung to build a regular, single-rank 32 GB module for client PCs using only eight single-die memory chips, but they also allow for higher capacity DIMMs that were not previously possible. We are talking about 1 TB memory modules using 40 8-Hi 3DS memory stacks based on eight 32 Gb memory devices. Such modules may sound overkill, but for artificial intelligence (AI), Big Data, and database servers, more DRAM capacity can easily be put to good use. Eventually, 1TB RDIMMs would allow for up to 12 TB of memory in a single socket server (e.g. AMD&#x27;s EPYC 9004 platform), something that cannot be done now.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: AMD last week announced what are probably the last major GPU launches of this generation of graphics cards: the $449 Radeon RX 7700 XT and $499 Radeon RX 7800 XT. AMD&#x27;s pricing and performance numbers pit the cards against Nvidia&#x27;s GeForce RTX 4060 Ti (specifically the $499 16GB version) and the $599 RTX 4070. AMD&#x27;s pricing is aggressive enough that Nvidia is quietly cutting the prices of some 16GB RTX 4060 Ti cards to $449, to match the RX 7700 XT. 

The announcement about the $50 reduction was buried toward the bottom of an email that Nvidia sent to GPU reviewers ahead of AMD&#x27;s launch next week; it also drew attention to Nvidia-specific features like DLSS upscaling and frame generation, which compete with AMD&#x27;s GPU-agnostic FSR, plus recent DLSS improvements that improve ray-tracing performance.

                              <span>Hot on the heels of its lunar landing success, India is readying to blast a probe even deeper into space to study the sun. From a report: The country&#x27;s first solar observation mission, named Aditya-L1, is set to be launched from India&#x27;s main spaceport on Sriharikota, an island off the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, at 11:50 a.m. local time on Saturday. The spacecraft is scheduled to spend 125 days traveling 1.5 million kilometers (932,000 miles) to its destination, a point in space where objects stay put and consume less fuel. 

While arriving there would be an impressive achievement for ISRO, the Indian space agency, Aditya-L1 would have gone just a fraction of the 150 million km between Earth and the sun. For ISRO, success would be another major feat after India became the first country to land a spacecraft close to the lunar south pole in August. India has more ambitious projects in the works. A human spaceflight program aims to launch astronauts into orbit for the first time possibly by 2025, ISRO Chairman S Somanath said in an interview with news agency Asian News International. ISRO and NASA plan to cooperate on sending astronauts to the International Space Station and India is in discussions with Japan to work together on a mission.

                              <span>The centenary of the Great Kanto earthquake brings angst, and lessons for the world. From a report: Every year on September 1st, Japan&#x27;s ministers trek by foot to the prime minister&#x27;s office to take part in a crisis simulation. Across the country, local officials and schoolchildren drill for disasters. The date marks the Great Kanto earthquake, a 7.9-magnitude tremor that struck near the capital back in 1923. The ensuing disaster killed at least 105,000 people, including around 70,000 in Tokyo itself, destroyed 370,000 homes and changed the course of Japanese history. 

This year&#x27;s centenary of the disaster has occasioned much commemoration -- and angst. What will happen when the next Big One hits? Seismologists cannot predict earthquakes, but their statistical models, which are based on past patterns, can estimate the likelihood of one. The city government&#x27;s experts reckon there is a 70% chance of a magnitude 7 or higher quake hitting the capital within the next 30 years. Far fewer people will probably die than during the disaster in 1923, thanks to better technology and planning: the worst case foresees some 6,000 deaths in the city. But millions of lives will be upended. 

Another, similarly likely scenario could be much worse. A Nankai Trough earthquake, envisaged south of Kansai, Japan&#x27;s industrial heartland, could trigger a tsunami; as many as 323,000 might be killed, according to an official estimate. Japan&#x27;s approach to the risks of such catastrophes offers insights for a warming world facing more frequent disasters. Quakes of this size could &quot;challenge the survival of Japan as a state&quot; and send economic shock waves around the globe, says Fukuwa Nobuo of Nagoya University. After the next Tokyo quake, recovering basic city functions could take weeks and rebuilding the capital could take years; direct damage alone could run to as much as $75bn. One piece of research estimates that gdp would dip by 11% following a Nankai earthquake.

                              <span>Spotify is cracking down on white-noise podcasters, reducing the advertising support for programmers that provide little more than soothing sounds like rain or chirping birds. From a report: In an email to creators Friday, the company highlighted changes to its Ambassador Ads program -- promotional spots for Spotify that podcasters read. The company pays hosts to read ads to encourage more creators to make shows and join the platform. As part of the change taking effect Oct. 1, white noise podcasters will no longer be eligible for such support, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The company is also raising the audience threshold that conventional podcasters must meet to qualify for those ads to 1,000 unique Spotify listeners over the past 60 days from 100.

                              <span>The theft of IT equipment and data, as well as digital and industrial espionage and sabotage, will cost Germany 206 billion euros ($224 billion) in 2023, German digital association Bitkom said on Friday. From a report: The damage will surpass the 200 billion euro mark for the third consecutive year, according to a Bitkom survey of more than 1,000 companies. &quot;The German economy is a highly attractive target for criminals and hostile states. The boundaries between organised crime and state-controlled actors are blurred,&quot; Bitkom President Ralf Wintergerst said. Around three quarters of the companies surveyed suffered digital attacks in the past 12 months, falling from 84% of the companies in the previous year.

                              <span>Hundreds of people who participated in a recent Tough Mudder event -- a very muddy obstacle course race -- held in Sonoma, California, have fallen ill with pustular rashes, lesions, fever, flu-like symptoms, nerve pain, and other symptoms, local health officials and media outlets report. From a report: The cases could be caused by various infectious agents, including Staphylococcus bacteria, but the leading culprit is the relatively obscure Aeromonas bacteria -- specifically A. hydrophila, according to the Sonoma County health department. In a statewide alert this week, the California Department of Public Health said it is considering it an Aeromonas outbreak, noting that multiple wound cultures have yielded the hardy bacterium. 

A spokesperson for the Sonoma County health department told the Los Angeles Times on Thursday that, based on calls and emails the department had received, health officials estimate that the outbreak involves around 300 cases. Tough Mudder participants, meanwhile, have tallied as many as 489 cases in online forums. The Tough Mudder event was held at the Sonoma Raceway on August 19 and 20, 2023, with symptoms of infection developing in cases within 12 to 48 hours afterward. The Sonoma County health department advisory noted that the race &quot;involved extensive skin exposure to mud&quot; and that participants with a rash, fever, or other symptoms should go to their health care provider or, if no provider is available, to a local emergency department.

                              <span>Dell and Samsung are the latest beneficiaries of the current frenzy of speculation surrounding anything AI related, with both vendors seeing a rise in share prices related to their future AI prospects. From a report: Shares in Dell were said to be up 8 percent in extended trading following the Round Rock company releasing its results for the second quarter of its financial year 2024. These showed that revenue was $22.9 billion, down 13 percent on the same period last year. However, this figure was also up 10 percent on the previous quarter, with the company attributing this growth to rising demand for AI-optimized servers, as well as its PowerStore and PowerFlex storage systems. AI accounted for 20 percent of server revenue in the first half of the year, Dell said. 

Similarly, Dell said it is seeing growth in demand for its workstations designed to help organizations run complex AI workloads locally, with its commercial client revenue hitting $10.6 billion. This accounted for the lion&#x27;s share of the Client Solutions Group second quarter revenue of $12.9 billion, which was down 16 percent year-on-year but up 8 percent on the last quarter. Dell vice chairman and chief operating officer Jeff Clarke said that the company continued to focus on the most profitable segments of the market where he claimed Dell has a leading position.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Paris became the first European capital to outlaw the vehicles on Friday, following a vote in April in which Parisiens overwhelmingly supported a ban, although turnout was low. Privately owned e-scooters, which the city cannot regulate, are exempt. Since their eruption onto the streets and sidewalks of cities across the world in 2019, e-scooters have posed unique regulatory problems for city officials. The vehicles often stayed in legal limbo as officials mapped out charters for e-scooter operators, capped fleets and regulated parking. 

Cities like San Francisco and Miami temporarily banned e-scooters before reintroducing them. Santa Monica, Calif., successfully sued an e-scooter operator over its lack of licensing. And New York delayed the vehicles&#x27; arrival, citing security concerns. But no city has been as strict as Paris, where e-scooter users are mourning a cheap and flexible way of getting around without having to ride the crammed metro or use Velib&#x27;, the popular but frequently overwhelmed bike-sharing system.

                              <span>Supermarket giant Lidl has issued a recall of Paw Patrol snacks after the website listed on the products&#x27; packaging began displaying explicit content unsuitable for children. From a report: Lidl, which operates more than 12,000 stores globally, is urging shoppers in the United Kingdom to return the snacks for a full refund. Affected products include Paw Patrol Yummy Bakes and Paw Patrol Mini Biscotti, snacks recommended for children aged two and above. Lidl&#x27;s recall notice dated August 22 warns that the product&#x27;s packaging contains a web address that has been &quot;compromised&quot; to display content &quot;not suitable for child consumption.&quot;

                              <span>According to Bloombeg&#x27;s Mark Gurman (paywalled), Apple is experimenting with a new 3D-printing manufacturing process for some device production, starting with the upcoming Apple Watch Series 9 models. MacRumors reports: The new manufacturing process that Apple is testing would use less material than the large slabs of metal that are needed for traditional CNC manufacturing, plus it would cut down on the time that it takes to make new devices. With a technique called &quot;binder jetting,&quot; Apple is able to print a device&#x27;s outline at close to its actual shape using a powdered substance. A second process uses heat and pressure to squeeze the material into a substance that feels like steel, and it is then refined with milling.
 
Gurman&#x27;s information echoes what we&#x27;ve already heard from Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Back in July, Kuo said that the upcoming second-generation Apple Watch Ultra will include 3D printed mechanical parts. Specifically, he claimed that Apple is &quot;actively adopting 3D printing technology,&quot; and that some of the titanium components in the new Apple Watch Ultra would be 3D printed. Gurman claims that Apple plans to use this new 3D printing method for the chassis of the stainless steel Apple Watch Series 9 models rather than components for the Ultra but either way, it sounds like Apple is more actively testing this manufacturing method as of 2023. Gurman says that Apple plans to 3D print titanium devices in 2024. The report notes that the shift to 3D printing would also &quot;allow Apple to improve manufacturing times and potentially cut down on costs.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from UploadVR: Magic Leap 1 AR headsets will &#x27;cease to function&#x27; from December 31, 2024, the company announced. Magic Leap 1 launched in mid 2018 as the first transparent AR headset marketed and sold to consumers. The headset is powered by a tethered waist-mounted compute pack and came with a single tracked controller, though it got hand tracking support too. Content for the device included avatar chat, a floating web browser, a Wayfair app for seeing how furniture might look in your room, two games made by Insomniac Games, and a Spotify background app.
 
But Magic Leap 1&#x27;s eye-watering $2300 price and the limitations of transparent optics (even today) meant it reportedly fell significantly short of sales expectations. Transparent AR currently provides a much smaller field of view than the opaque display systems of VR-style headsets, despite costing significantly more. And Magic Leap 1&#x27;s form factor wasn&#x27;t suitable for outdoor use, so it didn&#x27;t provide the out-of-home functionality AR glasses promise to one day like on-foot navigation, translation, and contextual information. The Information reported that Magic Leap&#x27;s founder, the CEO at the time, originally expected it to sell over one million units in the first year. In reality it reportedly sold just 6000 units in the first six months.

                              <span>When things aren&#x27;t going well with a new hire, the problem usually falls into one of two categories: competency or engagement. If it&#x27;s a problem with engagement – their style of collaboration, their communication, their approach – there&#x27;s a good chance you can fix it with some clear feedback. But if the problem is with core competency – their technical skills – you can&#x27;t expect to solve that with a stern conversation.
It&#x27;s true that it might not be entirely clear in the early days of a new hire whether problems fall into one category or the other. But eventually it will be clear, and when it is, you have to act accordingly. 
Problems with engagement are often simply due to unstated assumptions. You expect someone to act a certain way, but they don&#x27;t realize that, so they don&#x27;t, and you&#x27;re …</span>

But despite Chef&#x27;s success, Adam constantly battled self-doubt and finding his footing as a leader. 
 In this raw episode, Adam shares how the pressure of going from sysadmin to startup CEO caused an identity crisis. He opens up about the motivational speech that left him in tears, realizing his self-worth was too tied to Chef&#x27;s outcomes.

The crates were immediately yanked and the user account locked, and the crates were then fully removed from the crates.io file store on August 18.
Phylum have also written their own blog on this incident.

These crates contained malicious build.rs files that would attempt to send metadata from the user&#x27;s computer to a Telegram2 channel, including their operating system, IP address, and geolocation information based on their IP address.3
One version of one crate also contained a copy of the PuTTY4 installer, with the build.rs spawning PuTTY instead of sending metadata to Telegram. Our assumption is that this was a…</span>

                              <span>An autonomous, artificial-intelligence-powered drone called Swift has beaten humanity&#x27;s best drone racers. &quot;The AI-equipped drone, developed by researchers at the University of Zurich, came out on top in 15 out of 25 races and recorded the single fastest lap time,&quot; reports Gizmodo. The findings have been published in the journal Nature. From the report: Swift beat the humans in the niche but growing sport of first-person view drone racing. Human competitors navigate using a headset connected to a camera on their drones to pilot a quadcopter through complex obstacle courses at extreme speeds, with the goal of finishing the race with the fastest time and avoiding taking too much damage in the process. Drones in these races can top 50 miles per hour when they&#x27;re really buzzing. The [video her…</span>

                              <span>According to a new report by The Wall Street Journal, mobile carriers including Verizon, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile are all requiring customers to switch to a debit card or bank account withdrawal in order to receive an autopay discount on their plan. Verizon has included this requirement for years, but in the past few months the other two carriers have quietly added it too. The Verge reports: The new rule goes into effect for AT&amp;T customers on October 2nd, and as a gesture of goodwill, the company will only reduce your discount if you continue to pay with a credit card. Those who register for autopay with a bank or debit card will receive $10 off; a credit card will only get you $5. T-Mobile&#x27;s change went into effect in July, also eliminating Apple Pay and Google Pay as methods eligible for the $5 discount. Oh, and technically, you can qualify for Verizon&#x27;s autopay discount with a credit card -- it just has to be a Verizon Visa card.
 
AT&amp;T and T-Mobile aren&#x27;t just making this a requirement for new customers -- the change is being applied to all postpaid accounts. Even if you&#x27;ve been receiving the discount for years with a credit card, you&#x27;ll have to make the switch in order to keep your discount. And it adds up -- the discounts are applied for each line on your plan, so if your whole family is on the same plan, it&#x27;s a significant amount of money.

US District Judge David Alan Ezra granted a preliminary injunction temporarily blocking enforcement after the Free Speech Coalition (FSC) joined adult performers and sites like Pornhub in a lawsuit opposing the law. Today, they convinced Ezra that Texas&#x27; law violates the First Amendment and would have &quot;a chilling effect on legally-protected speech,&quot; FSC said in a press release.

                              <span>UK&#x27;s Home Office is looking to increase its use of controversial facial recognition technologies to track and find criminals within policing and other security agencies. From a report: In a document released on Wednesday, the government outlined its ambitions to potentially deploy new biometric systems nationally over the next 12 to 18 months. The move comes after privacy campaigners and independent academics criticised the technology for being inaccurate and biased, particularly against darker-skinned people. 

MPs have previously called for a moratorium on its use on the general population until clear laws are established by parliament. The government is calling for submissions from companies for technologies that &quot;can resolve identity using facial features and landmarks,&quot; including for live facial recognition which involves screening the general public for specific individuals on police watch lists. 

In particular, the Home Office is highlighting its interest in novel artificial intelligence technologies that could process facial data efficiently to identify individuals, and software that could be integrated with existing technologies deployed by the department and with CCTV cameras. Facial recognition software has been used by South Wales Police and London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police over the past five years across multiple trials in public spaces including shopping centres, during events such as the Notting Hill Carnival and, more recently, during the coronation.

                              <span>To date, Google has processed more than seven billion copyright takedown requests for its search engine. The majority of the reported links are purged from Google&#x27;s search index, as required by the DMCA. Recently, however, Google appears to gone a step further, using search takedowns to &quot;moderate&quot; users&#x27; privately saved links collections. TorrentFreak: A few hours ago, Eddie Roosenmaallen shared an email from Google, notifying him that a link had been removed from his Google Saved collection because it violates Google&#x27;s policy. The reason cited for the removal is the &quot;downstream impact,&quot; as the URL in question is &quot;blocked by Google Search.&quot; 

&quot;The following saved item in one of your collections was determined to violate Google&#x27;s policy. As a result, the item will be moderated..,&quot; Google writes, pointing out a defunct KickassTorrents domain as the problem. Initially, it was suggested that this removal impacted Google&#x27;s synched Chrome bookmarks but further research reveals that&#x27;s not the case. Instead, the removals apply to Google&#x27;s saved feature. This Google service allows users to save and organize links, similar to what Pinterest does. These link collections can be private or shared with third parties.

                              <span>The US Copyright Office is opening a public comment period around AI and copyright issues beginning August 30th as the agency figures out how to approach the subject. From a report: As announced [PDF] in the Federal Register, the agency wants to answer three main questions: how AI models should use copyrighted data in training; whether AI-generated material can be copyrighted even without a human involved; and how copyright liability would work with AI. It also wants comments around AI possibly violating publicity rights but noted these are not technically copyright issues. The Copyright Office said if AI does mimic voices, likenesses, or art styles, it may impact state-mandated rules around publicity and unfair competition laws. Written comments are due on October 18th, and replies must be submitted to the Copyright Office by November 15th. 

The copyright status of AI training data and the output of generative AI tools has become a hot topic for politicians, artists, authors, and even civil rights groups, making it a potential testing ground for coming AI regulation. The Copyright Office says that &quot;over the past several years, the Office has begun to receive applications to register works containing AI-generated material.&quot; It may use the comments to inform how it decides to grant copyright in the future. The Copyright Office was involved in a lawsuit last year after it refused to grant Stephen Thaler rights to an image created by an AI platform. Earlier this month, a Washington, DC, court sided with the US Copyright Office in the case, stating copyright has never been handed to any work without a human involved.

                              <span>The stakes are high for Bethesda&#x27;s newest role-playing game. Microsoft needs an Xbox hit, and players are hungry for an expansive and satisfying space adventure. From a report: Starfield almost immediately nudges its players to the edges of the cosmos. In the opening hours of the role-playing video game, it&#x27;s possible to land your spaceship on Earth&#x27;s moon or zip 16 light-years to Alpha Centauri. When you open your map and zoom out from a planet, you can behold its surrounding solar system; zoom out again, and you&#x27;re scrolling past luminous stars and the mysterious worlds that orbit them. That sprawling celestial journey within Starfield, developed by Bethesda Game Studios, reveals both the tremendous potential and the monumental challenge of an open-world space adventure. Bethesda has hyped an expansive single-player campaign with 1,000 explorable planets. And expectations around the game, officially releasing on Sept. 6 after a 10-month delay, are nearly as vast. 

It&#x27;s the first new universe in 25 years for Bethesda, known for the Elder Scrolls and Fallout series. It&#x27;s also a high-stakes moment for Microsoft, which makes the Xbox and has long faced criticism that it produces fewer hit games than its console rivals, Sony and Nintendo. To compete, Microsoft went on a spending spree, acquiring Bethesda&#x27;s parent company in 2020 and agreeing to purchase Activision Blizzard in 2022, a $69 billion bet that is being challenged by regulators. Now Bethesda must deliver. Known for letting players navigate competing factions and undertake eccentric quests, the studio hopes Starfield will dazzle those clamoring for engaging encounters with alien life-forms or space mercenaries as well as a sense of boundless exploration.

                              <span>The latest version of the flagship FOSS browser is out, and it&#x27;s picked up one of the main features for which we keep Chrome around. From a report: The Firefox version 117 feature list might not look all that impressive, but it does have a big-ticket feature that may tempt people back: automatic translation. The snag is it&#x27;s disabled by default in the release version, and you&#x27;ll have to manually enable it. Although it was enabled in the betas, Mozilla has decided to go for a staged rollout and not enable it for everyone until Firefox 118 in six weeks or so. 

The new feature is integrated, privacy-respecting machine translation between multiple languages. This was already possible in older versions, but it needed an extension, and that had two side effects. One is that the extension hooked deep into the core of the browser in ways that Mozilla wasn&#x27;t comfortable about, and the other is that once your text had been sent out to a third-party website, it could be snooped upon -- but the victims of any snooping would blame the browser, even if it wasn&#x27;t the browser&#x27;s fault. To enable it, go to the configuration page (enter about:config in the address bar), and search for a setting called browser.translations.enable.

                              <span>Researchers say they have found fake apps in Google Play that masqueraded as legitimate ones for the Signal and Telegram messaging platforms. The malicious apps could pull messages or other sensitive information from legitimate accounts when users took certain actions. ArsTechnica: An app with the name Signal Plus Messenger was available on Play for nine months and had been downloaded from Play roughly 100 times before Google took it down last April after being tipped off by security firm ESET. It was also available in the Samsung app store and on signalplus[.]org, a dedicated website mimicking the official Signal.org. An app calling itself FlyGram, meanwhile, was created by the same threat actor and was available through the same three channels. Google removed it from Play in 2021. Both apps remain available in the Samsung store. 

Both apps were built on open source code available from Signal and Telegram. Interwoven into that code was an espionage tool tracked as BadBazaar. The Trojan has been linked to a China-aligned hacking group tracked as GREF. BadBazaar has been used previously to target Uyghurs and other Turkic ethnic minorities. The FlyGram malware was also shared in a Uyghur Telegram group, further aligning it to previous targeting by the BadBazaar malware family. Signal Plus could monitor sent and received messages and contacts if people connected their infected device to their legitimate Signal number, as is normal when someone first installs Signal on their device. Doing so caused the malicious app to send a host of private information to the attacker, including the device IMEI number, phone number, MAC address, operator details, location data, Wi-Fi information, emails for Google accounts, contact list, and a PIN used to transfer texts in the event one was set up by the user.

                              <span>The organization that represents the literary works of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard has filed a petition with the Federal Government, asking it to make it illegal to circumvent software locks for the repair of a highly specific set of electronic devices, according to a letter reviewed by 404 Media. From the report: The letter doesn&#x27;t refer to any single device, but experts say the petition covers Scientology&#x27;s &quot;E-Meter,&quot; a &quot;religious artifact&quot; and electronic that is core to Scientology. Author Services Inc., a group &quot;representing the literary, theatrical, and musical works of L. Ron Hubbard,&quot; told the U.S. Copyright Office that it opposes the renewal of an exemption to Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act that makes it legal for consumers to hack their personal electronics for the purposes of repair. 

This exemption to copyright law is needed because many electronics manufacturers put arbitrary software locks, Digital Rights Management systems, or other technological prevention measures that stop consumers from diagnosing or repairing devices unless they are authorized to do so. Special exemptions to copyright law make it legal for farmers to hack past John Deere&#x27;s DRM to fix their tractors, consumers to use software tools to help them repair certain parts of game consoles, or use third-party software to circumvent repair locks on printers, air conditioners, laptops, etc.

                              <span>VanMoof, the Dutch e-bike maker that gained a zealous following but declared bankruptcy last month, has been acquired by Lavoie, an upscale electric scooter company, the firms announced on Thursday. From a report: Riders of the expensive and technologically advanced VanMoof bikes were left in limbo by the company&#x27;s bankruptcy, because the machines are built from proprietary parts that only the company made and many of the bikes&#x27; functions are linked to a smartphone app that runs on the company&#x27;s servers. Despite the buzz around the brand, VanMoof had run into financial problems that led to a production backlog and monthslong waits for sales and repairs. 

But riders will not be completely out of limbo under the new ownership. &quot;What they can&#x27;t expect in the first couple of weeks is definitive answers to the problems,&quot; said Nick Fry, the chairman of McLaren Applied, the British motorsports technology company that owns Lavoie. The price of the acquisition was not disclosed, but Mr. Fry said Lavoie would spend &quot;tens of millions&quot; on the transaction as well as in investments over the coming months to &quot;rectify some of the challenges we face.&quot; He said, &quot;this is not going to be a walk in the park. This is going to be a challenge.&quot; One of the new owner&#x27;s priorities, he added, was improving the availability of parts and repairs, something that had become increasingly difficult for VanMoof owners. Regular bike shops could not -- or sometimes would not -- fix the bikes.

                              <span>A tiny island in the Caribbean is now sitting on a digital treasure. From a report: Anguilla, a tropical British territory, is known for its coral reefs and white sand beaches. Since the 1990s, however, it&#x27;s also been in charge of assigning internet addresses that end in .ai to residents and businesses looking to register websites. It was one of hundreds of country-specific domain names and easy to overlook -- until recently. Stability.ai, Elon Musk&#x27;s X.ai and Character.ai are just a few of the hot artificial intelligence startups that have snapped up the .ai domain assigned to the islands and cays that comprise Anguilla. Plenty of tech giants have their own web addresses ending in .ai as well: Google.ai and Facebook.ai route visitors to their company&#x27;s AI-focused webpages and Microsoft.ai shows off the company&#x27;s Azure AI services. 

The total number of registrations of sites ending with these two letters has effectively doubled in the past year to 287,432, according to Vince Cate, who for decades has managed the .ai domain for Anguilla. Cate estimates Anguilla will bring in as much as $30 million in domain-registration fees for 2023. Once one of the many obscure top-level domains assigned to countries and territories, .ai websites experienced a slow but steady increase in demand in recent years. But the sudden spike in .ai domains nine months ago highlights the broader frenzy around artificial intelligence and its ripple effects throughout the global economy. Since ChatGPT launched, a growing number of tech companies have raced to raise billions in capital, scoop up engineering talent and secure powerful but increasingly scarce chips. A domain may sound less essential, but for an industry obsessed with clever branding, the right name can be everything. &quot;Since November 30, things are very different here,&quot; Cate said, referring to the date when ChatGPT launched publicly.
