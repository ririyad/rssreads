                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Earlier this year, the National Supercomputing Center in Wuxi (an entity blacklisted in the U.S.) launched its new supercomputer based on the enhanced China-designed Sunway SW26010 Pro processors with 384 cores. Sunway&#x27;s SW26010 Pro CPU not only packs more cores than its non-Pro SW26010 predecessor, but it more than quadrupled FP64 compute throughput due to microarchitectural and system architecture improvements, according to Chips and Cheese. However, while the manycore CPU is good on paper, it has several performance bottlenecks. 

The first details of the manycore Sunway SW26010 Pro CPU and supercomputers that use it emerged back in 2021. Now, the company has showcased actual processors and disclosed more details about their architecture and design, which represent a significant leap in performance, recently at SC23. The new CPU is expected to enable China to build high-performance supercomputers based entirely on domestically developed processors. Each Sunway SW26010 Pro has a maximum FP64 throughput of 13.8 TFLOPS, which is massive. For comparison, AMD&#x27;s 96-core EPYC 9654 has a peak FP64 performance of around 5.4 TFLOPS. 

The SW26010 Pro is an evolution of the original SW26010, so it maintains the foundational architecture of its predecessor but introduces several key enhancements. The new SW26010 Pro processor is based on an all-new proprietary 64-bit RISC architecture and packs six core groups (CG) and a protocol processing unit (PPU). Each CG integrates 64 2-wide compute processing elements (CPEs) featuring a 512-bit vector engine as well as 256 KB of fast local store (scratchpad cache) for data and 16 KB for instructions; one management processing element (MPE), which is a superscalar out-of-order core with a vector engine, 32 KB/32 KB L1 instruction/data cache, 256 KB L2 cache; and a 128-bit DDR4-3200 memory interface.

                              <span>Chinese health authorities have provided the requested data on an increase in respiratory illnesses and reported clusters of pneumonia in children, and have not detected any unusual or novel pathogens, the World Health Organization (WHO) said. From a report: The WHO had asked China for more information on Wednesday after groups including the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases reported clusters of undiagnosed pneumonia in children in north China. As per the rule, China responded to the WHO within 24 hours. The WHO had sought epidemiologic and clinical information as well as laboratory results through the International Health Regulations mechanism. 

Epidemiologists have warned that as, China heads into its first winter since the lifting of zero-Covid restrictions, natural levels of immunity to respiratory viruses may be lower than normal, leading to an increase in infections. Several countries, including the US and the UK, experienced large waves of respiratory viral infections in the first winter after Covid restrictions were lifted as people had lower natural levels of immunity. For young children, lockdowns delayed the age at which they were first exposed to common bugs.

                              <span>Nvidia has swung from fourth to first place in an assessment of chip industry revenue published today. From a report: Taipei-based financial analyst Dan Nystedt noted that the green team took the revenue crown from contract chip-making titan TSMC as Q3 financials came into view. Those keeping an eye on the world of investing and finance will have seen our report about Nvidia&#x27;s earnings explosion, evidenced by the firm&#x27;s publishing of its Q3 FY23 results. 

Nvidia charted an amazing performance, with a headlining $18.12 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 206% year-over-year (YoY). The firm&#x27;s profits were also through the roof, and Nystedt posted a graph showing Nvidia elbowed past its chip industry rivals by this metric in Q3 2023, too. Nvidia&#x27;s advance is supported by multiple highly successful operating segments, which have provided a multiplicative effect on its revenue and income. Again, we saw clear evidence of a seismic shift in revenue, with the latest set of financials shared with investors earlier this week.

                              <span>The world&#x27;s biggest iceberg is on the move after more than 30 years being stuck to the ocean floor. From a report: The iceberg, called A23a, split from the Antarctic coastline in 1986. But it swiftly grounded in the Weddell Sea, becoming, essentially, an ice island. At almost 4,000 sq km (1,500 sq miles) in area, it&#x27;s more than twice the size of Greater London. The past year has seen it drifting at speed, and the berg is now about to spill beyond Antarctic waters. A23a is a true colossus, and it&#x27;s not just its width that impresses. 

This slab of ice is some 400m (1,312 ft) thick. For comparison, the London Shard, the tallest skyscraper in Europe, is a mere 310m tall. At the time, it was hosting a Soviet research station, which just illustrates how long ago its calving occurred. Moscow despatched an expedition to remove equipment from the Druzhnaya 1 base, fearing it would be lost. But the tabular berg didn&#x27;t move far from the coast before its deep keel anchored it rigidly to the Weddell&#x27;s bottom-muds. 

So, why, after almost 40 years, is A23a on the move now?

&quot;I asked a couple of colleagues about this, wondering if there was any possible change in shelf water temperatures that might have provoked it, but the consensus is the time had just come,&quot; said Dr Andrew Fleming, a remote sensing expert from the British Antarctic Survey. &quot;It was grounded since 1986 but eventually it was going to decrease (in size) sufficiently to lose grip and start moving. I spotted first movement back in 2020.&quot; A23a has put on a spurt in recent months, driven by winds and currents, and is now passing the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.

                              <span>AI models can find patterns and make predictions, but their reasoning is often inscrutable. This &quot;black box&quot; issue makes AI less reliable and less scientifically useful. However, a team led by Dion Hafner (a computer scientist at the University of Copenhagen) devised a clever neural network to predict rogue waves. By restricting inputs to meaningful wave measurements and tracing how they flowed through the network, the team extracted a simple five-part equation encapsulating the AI&#x27;s logic. Economist adds: To generate a human-comprehensible equation, the researchers used a method inspired by natural selection in biology. They told a separate algorithm to come up with a slew of different equations using those five variables, with the aim of matching the neural network&#x27;s output as closely as possible. The best equations were mixed and combined, and the process was repeated. The result, eventually, was an equation that was simple and almost as accurate as the neural network. Both predicted rogue waves better than existing models. 

The first part of the equation rediscovered a bit of existing theory: it is an approximation of a well-known equation in wave dynamics. Other parts included some terms that the researchers suspected might be involved in rogue-wave formation but are not in standard models. There were some puzzlers, too: the final bit of the equation includes a term that is inversely proportional to how spread out the energy of the waves is. Current human theories include a second variable that the machine did not replicate. One explanation is that the network was not trained on a wide enough selection of examples. Another is that the machine is right, and the second variable is not actually necessary.

                              <span>At a time when some are calling for a pause on the development of generative AI, Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA, has an argument for accelerating the work: AI advances are going to provide tools to better understand the technology and to make it safer, Huang said in a discussion with Goldman Sachs Asset Management. From a report: &quot;We need to accelerate the development of AI as fast as possible, and the reason for that is because safety requires technology,&quot; Huang said in an interview at The Forum with Sung Cho, co-head of Tech Investing for Fundamental Equity in GSAM. 

Consider how much safer today&#x27;s passenger cars are compared with those of earlier generations, Huang suggested, because the technology has advanced. He cited as an example how OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT uses reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to create guardrails that make its responses more relevant, accurate, and appropriate. 

The RLHF is itself an AI model that sits around the core AI model. Huang lists examples of other AI technologies that hold promise for making the models safer and more effective. These range from retrieval augmented generation, in which the model gets information from a defined knowledge base or set of documents, to physics-informed reinforcement learning, which grounds the model in physical principles and constraints. &quot;We need a bunch more technology like that,&quot; Huang said.

                              <span>Dirty air killed more than half a million people in the EU in 2021, estimates show, and about half of the deaths could have been avoided by cutting pollution to the limits recommended by doctors. From a report: The researchers from the European Environment Agency attributed 253,000 early deaths to concentrations of fine particulates known as PM2.5 that breached the World Health Organization&#x27;s maximum guideline limits of 5ug/m3. A further 52,000 deaths came from excessive levels of nitrogen dioxide and 22,000 deaths from short-term exposure to excessive levels of ozone. 

&quot;The figures released today by the EEA remind us that air pollution is still the number one environmental health problem in the EU,&quot; said Virginijus Sinkevicius, the EU&#x27;s environment commissioner. Doctors say air pollution is one of the biggest killers in the world but death tolls will drop quickly if countries clean up their economies. Between 2005 and 2021, the number of deaths from PM2.5 in the EU fell 41%, and the EU aims to reach 55% by the end of the decade. The WHO, which tightened its air quality guidelines in 2021, warns that no level of air pollution can be considered safe but has set upper limits for certain pollutants. The European parliament voted in September to align the EU&#x27;s air quality rules with the WHO&#x27;s but decided to delay doing so until 2035.

                              <span>Coal, the dirtiest of fossil fuels, is far more harmful to human health than previously thought, according to a new report, which found that coal emissions are associated with double the mortality risk compared with fine airborne particles from other sources. From a report: The research, published Thursday in the journal Science, linked coal pollution to 460,000 deaths among Medicare recipients aged 65 and older between 1999 and 2020. Yet the study also found that during that period the shuttering of coal plants in the United State, coupled with the installation of scrubbers in the smokestacks to &quot;clean&quot; coal exhaust, has had salubrious effects. Deaths attributable to coal plant emissions among Medicare recipients dropped from about 50,000 a year in 1999 to 1,600 in 2020, a decrease of more than 95 percent, the researchers found. 

&quot;Things were bad, it was terrible,&quot; Lucas Henneman, the study&#x27;s lead author, and an assistant professor in environmental engineering at George Mason University, said in an interview. &quot;We made progress, and that&#x27;s really good.&quot; Researchers from six universities collected emissions data from 480 coal power plants between 1999 and 2020. They used atmospheric modeling to track how sulfur dioxide converted into particulate matter and where it was carried by wind, and then examined millions of Medicare patient deaths by ZIP code. 

Though the researchers could not identify exact causes of death, the statistical model showed that areas with more airborne coal particulates had higher death rates. Some 138 coal plants each contributed to at least 1,000 excess deaths, and 10 plants were linked to more than 5,000 deaths apiece, the researchers found. While fine particulate matter, known as P.M. 2.5, is frequently examined for its health risks, the researchers found that inhaling those fine particles from coal exhaust was especially deadly.

                              <span>Nvidia has told customers in China it is delaying the launch of a new AI chip it designed to comply with U.S. export rules until the first quarter of next year, Reuters reported Friday, citing sources familiar with the matter. From the report: The delayed chip is the H20, the most powerful of three China-focused chips Nvidia has developed to comply with fresh U.S. export restrictions, the sources said, and could complicate its efforts to preserve market share in China against local rivals like Huawei. The California-based AI chip giant had been expected to launch the new products as early as Nov. 16, chip industry newsletter SemiAnalysis reported this month. 

However, the H20 launch has now been pushed back until the first quarter of next year, the sources said, with one saying they were advised it could take place in February or March. The sources said they were told that the H20 was being delayed due to issues server manufacturers were having in integrating the chip.

                              <span>Some Pixel 8 Pro owners have noticed circular bumps in several places on the screen that look to be the result of something pressing up against the underside, which is soft and fragile, of the 6.7-inch OLED panel. From a report: A statement from the company today acknowledges how &quot;some users may see impressions from components in the device that look like small bumps&quot; in specific conditions. Google says there is &quot;no functional impact to Pixel 8 performance or durability,&quot; which does line up with all current reports.

                              <span>The British Library has confirmed that personal data stolen in a cyber-attack has appeared online, apparently for sale to the highest bidder. From a report: The attack was carried out in October by a group known for such criminal activity, said the UK&#x27;s national library, which holds about 14m books and millions of other items. This week, Rhysida, a known ransomware group, claimed it was responsible for the attack. It posted low-resolution images of personal information online, offering stolen data for sale with a starting bid of 20 bitcoins (about $750,000). Rhysida said the data was &quot;exclusive, unique and impressive&quot; and that it would be sold to a single buyer. It set a deadline for bids of 27 November. 

The images appear to show employment contracts and passport information. The library said it was &quot;aware that some data has been leaked, which appears to be from files relating to our internal HR information.&quot; It did not confirm that Rhysida was responsible for the attack, nor that the data offered for sale was information on personnel. Academics and researchers who use the library have been told that disruption to the institution&#x27;s services after the serious ransomware attack was likely to continue for months. This week, the library advised its users to change any logins also used on other sites as a precaution.

                              <span>The office sector&#x27;s credit crunch is intensifying. By one measure, it&#x27;s now worse than during the 2008-09 global financial crisis. From a report: Only one out of every three securitized office mortgages that expired during the first nine months of 2023 was paid off by the end of September, according to Moody&#x27;s Analytics. That is the smallest share for the first nine months of any year since at least 2008 and well below the nadir reached in 2009, when 47% of these loans got paid off. That share is also well below the rate before the pandemic, when more than eight out of every 10 maturing securitized office mortgages were paid back in some years. 

While the numbers cover only office mortgages packaged into bonds -- so-called commercial mortgage-backed securities -- they reflect a broader freeze in the lending market for office buildings. Many office owners can&#x27;t pay back their old loans because they can&#x27;t get new mortgages. Remote work and rising vacancies have hit building profits, making it harder to pay interest. Higher interest rates have pushed debt costs up and building values down. That combination is fueling a rise in defaults. The share of office CMBS loans that are delinquent has tripled over the past year to 5.75%, according to Trepp. It doesn&#x27;t help that many banks no longer issue new office loans and that many insurance companies and debt funds have become more cautious.

From a report: Ashwini Vaishnaw, India&#x27;s IT Minister, said the ministry held meetings with all large social media companies, industry body Nasscom and academics earlier in the day and has reached a consensus that a regulation is needed to better combat spread of deepfake videos as well as apps that facilitate their creations. &quot;The companies share our concerns and they understood that it&#x27;s [deepfakes] are not free speech. They understood that it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s very harmful to the society,&quot; he said. &quot;They understood the need for much heavier regulation on this, so we agree that we will start drafting the regulation today itself.&quot; The ministry will be ready with &quot;clear actionable items&quot; on how to combat deepfakes in 10 days.

                              <span>Scientists have detected the most powerful cosmic ray seen in more than three decades. But the exact origin of this turbocharged particle from outer space remains a mystery, with some suggesting that it could have been generated by unknown physics. From a report: The puzzling cosmic ray had an estimated energy of 240 exa-electron volts (EeV; 10^18 volts), making it comparable to the most powerful cosmic ray ever detected, aptly named the Oh-My-God particle, which measured at around 320 EeV when it was discovered in 1991. The findings were published today in Science. 

&quot;It&#x27;s amazing because you have to think of what could produce such high energy,&quot; says Clancy James, an astronomer at Curtin University in Perth, Australia. A cosmic ray, despite its name, is actually a high-energy subatomic particle -- often a proton -- that zips through space at close to the speed of light. In their ultra-high energy form, cosmic rays have energy levels that exceed one EeV, which is around one million times greater than those reached by the most powerful human-made particle accelerators. Cosmic rays with energies of more than 100 EeV are rarely spotted -- fewer than one of these particles arrive on each square kilometre of Earth each century.

                              <span>At 26, nurse Benzor Vidal moved from the Philippines to America for work, but quit his unsafe, understaffed nursing home job after 14 weeks. His employment contract stipulated he could owe $20,000+ in damages if he resigned early. The New York Times Magazine digs deeper: This type of contract provision is known as a &quot;stay or pay&quot; clause, and it used to be common only for certain high-paying roles or in certain specialized industries. For airline pilots and software engineers, for example, it has been a longstanding practice at some companies to require employees to stay at their jobs for a defined period of time in order to recoup costs related to hiring and training. But the line between recouping costs and penalizing workers for leaving can be blurry, and companies have increasingly taken advantage of that ambiguity. Workers&#x27; rights advocates say that, in many cases, stay-or-pay clauses no longer accurately reflect the company&#x27;s costs but instead appear to be inflated financial penalties designed to discourage quitting. 

The use of stay-or-pay clauses has grown rapidly over the past decade, and it has seemingly exploded since the start of the pandemic, as companies try to retain workers in a tight labor market. The clauses have spread far beyond the handful of roles and industries where they originated and are now used by thousands of mid- and low-wage employers -- something that came to light when workers began filing lawsuits challenging the practice. These contract terms have been applied to bank workers, salespeople, dog groomers, police officers, aestheticians, firefighters, mechanics, nurses, federal employees, electricians, roofers, social workers, paramedics, truckers, mortgage brokers, teachers and metal polishers. Legal experts believe stay-or-pay clauses might now be in industries that employ a third of all American workers.

In a video published by JerryRigEverything, several easter eggs placed in the Teardown skins were found in the CASETiFY designs, alongside numerous tweaks and layout changes, and even Dbrand&#x27;s logo.

                              <span>Researchers have used the technology behind the AI chatbot ChatGPT to create a fake clinical-trial data set to support an unverified scientific claim. From a report: In a paper published in JAMA Ophthalmology on 9 November, the authors used GPT-4 -- the latest version of the large language model on which ChatGPT runs -- paired with Advanced Data Analysis (ADA), a model that incorporates the programming language Python and can perform statistical analysis and create data visualizations. The AI-generated data compared the outcomes of two surgical procedures and indicated -- wrongly -- that one treatment is better than the other. 

&quot;Our aim was to highlight that, in a few minutes, you can create a data set that is not supported by real original data, and it is also opposite or in the other direction compared to the evidence that are available,&quot; says study co-author Giuseppe Giannaccare, an eye surgeon at the University of Cagliari in Italy. The ability of AI to fabricate convincing data adds to concern among researchers and journal editors about research integrity. &quot;It was one thing that generative AI could be used to generate texts that would not be detectable using plagiarism software, but the capacity to create fake but realistic data sets is a next level of worry,&quot; says Elisabeth Bik, a microbiologist and independent research-integrity consultant in San Francisco, California. &quot;It will make it very easy for any researcher or group of researchers to create fake measurements on non-existent patients, fake answers to questionnaires or to generate a large data set on animal experiments.&quot;

                              <span>The founder of Chipotle is opening a new endeavor called Kernel, a vegetarian fast-casual restaurant that will be operated mostly by robots. Steve Ells is opening at least 15 locations of Kernel, the first by early 2024; the remainder are on track for NYC in the next two years, a spokesperson confirms. From a report: Kernel will serve vegetarian sandwiches, salads, and sides, made in a space that&#x27;s around 1,000 square-feet or smaller. Each location would employ three workers, the Wall Street Journal reported, &quot;rather than the dozen that many fast-casual eateries have working.&quot; The menu pricing will be on par with Chipotle&#x27;s, and, Ells says, the company will pay more and offer better benefits for actual humans working than other chains. 

As you&#x27;d expect from the former CEO of Chipotle -- which had at least five foodborne illness outbreaks between 2015 and 2018, costing the company $25 million per the Justice Department -- &quot;the new system&#x27;s design helps better ensure food safety,&quot; Ells told the Journal. It has taken $10 million in his personal funds to start Kernel, along with $36 million from investors. The company suggests customers may not want much interaction with other people -- and neither do CEOs. &quot;We&#x27;ve taken a lot of human interaction out of the process and left just enough,&quot; he told the Journal. Yet in a 2022 study on the future of dining out conducted by commerce site, PYMNTS, of 2,500 people surveyed, 63 percent of diners believe restaurants are becoming increasingly understaffed, and 39 percent said that they are becoming less personal.

                              <span>Anthony Levandowski, a tech entrepreneur and self-driving car pioneer, said he&#x27;s rebooting his AI church in a renewed attempt at creating a religious movement focused on the worship and understanding of artificial intelligence. From a report: Levandowski&#x27;s so-called Way of the Future was founded in 2015 but shut its doors a few years later. The congregation at the new church, which shares the original&#x27;s name, has &quot;a couple thousand people&quot; coming together to build a spiritual connection between humans and AI, its founder said. 

Levandowski made the remarks during an interview for the latest episode of the Bloomberg Originals series AI IRL, available to stream now. &quot;How does a person in rural America relate to this? What does this mean for their job?&quot; he said. &quot;Way of the Future is a mechanism for them to understand and participate and shape the public discourse as to how we think technology should be built to improve you.&quot; 

The existence of the original church became public in 2017, years before the viral success of ChatGPT brought AI into mainstream consciousness. Levandowski&#x27;s idea raised eyebrows, both because of the church&#x27;s focus on &quot;the realization, acceptance, and worship of a Godhead based on Artificial Intelligence developed through computer hardware and software,&quot; and because of Levandowski himself. At the time, he was at the center of a high-profile legal battle related to the theft of trade secrets, sentenced to 18 months in prison, then pardoned by former President Donald Trump.

                              <span>Ian Hickson, a software engineer at Google who left the company after 18 years, reflects on his time at the firm in a blog post and why he thinks the firm lost its way. He joined in 2005 when its culture genuinely prioritized doing good, but over time he saw that culture erode into one focused on profits over users, he writes. The recent layoffs have damaged trust and morale across the company, he writes. An excerpt from the post: Much of these problems with Google today stem from a lack of visionary leadership from Sundar Pichai, and his clear lack of interest in maintaining the cultural norms of early Google. A symptom of this is the spreading contingent of inept middle management. Take Jeanine Banks, for example, who manages the department that somewhat arbitrarily contains (among other…</span>

                              <span>NASA selected Blue Origin in February to launch the Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers (ESCAPADE) mission, a pair of smallsats that will study the interaction of the solar wind with the magnetosphere of Mars. The space agency now expects the mission will be on the first launch of Blue Origin&#x27;s New Glenn launch vehicle next year. SpaceNews reports: Neither Blue Origin nor NASA disclosed exactly where in the manifest of New Glenn launches ESCAPADE would take place. &quot;It will be an early New Glenn mission and we&#x27;re going to be ready,&quot; one Blue Origin executive, Ariane Cornell, said at the Satellite 2023 conference in March.

                              <span>GameMaker announced that it will be free to use for noncommercial, non-console projects, breaking away from Unity and its massive pricing controversy that saw game developers boycotting the engine. The company is also &quot;eliminating its indie / creator tier monthly subscription fee in favor of a one-time paid licensing fee of $99,&quot; reports The Verge. &quot;Additionally, if you&#x27;re currently enrolled at the indie / creator tier and wish to pay the licensing fee, the subscription fees you&#x27;ve paid will be discounted from the price.&quot; The Verge: Russell Kay, head of GameMaker, said that the changes were a way for the company to express its thanks to users, explaining that, since 2021, GameMaker has seen its user base triple in size. Kay also had some subtle but effective shade for GameMaker&#x27;s competitors. &quot;We have seen other platforms making awkward moves with their pricing and terms, so we thought, what if we did the opposite, something that could actually be good for developers?&quot; Kay wrote in the announcement.
 
Though customers currently enrolled in an enterprise-level subscription will see no changes to their plans, it seems like GameMaker is counting on the pricing update to draw more people to the software. &quot;Our success is measured by the number of people making games!&quot; Kay wrote.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Reuters: Ahead of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman&#x27;s four days in exile, several staff researchers sent the board of directors a letter warning of a powerful artificial intelligence discovery that they said could threaten humanity, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The previously unreported letter and AI algorithm was a key development ahead of the board&#x27;s ouster of Altman, the poster child of generative AI, the two sources said. Before his triumphant return late Tuesday, more than 700 employees had threatened to quit and join backer Microsoft in solidarity with their fired leader. The sources cited the letter as one factor among a longer list of grievances by the board that led to Altman&#x27;s firing. Reuters was unable to review a copy of the let…</span>

                              <span>Brian Silvestro reports via Motor1.com: New Jersey announced a new rule set on Wednesday laying out plans to transition sales of light-duty vehicles in the state to 100-percent zero-emission by 2035. According to a statement released by the office of governor Phil Murphy, the law, titled the Advanced Clean Cars II rule, will come into effect starting in 2027, where manufacturers must ensure that zero-emissions vehicles represent 42 percent of sales in the state. That percentage will climb with each year until 2035, when it reaches 100 percent. Currently, EVs represent roughly 12 percent of all new vehicle sales, according to the governor&#x27;s office.
 
The new law will also put more stringent standards in place for traditional ICE-powered vehicles, with the goal of improving air quality in New Jersey communities and high-traffic corridors. While the announcement does not directly mention investment into charging infrastructure, the governor&#x27;s office points out its continued dedication to providing adequate charging locations across the state, claiming it has helped fund the installment of 2,980 charging stations with 5,271 ports at 680 locations. New Jersey is the ninth state to enact a ban on future ICE car sales, joining California, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: Sam Altman may have been asked to leave OpenAI, but his involvement in crypto project Tools for Humanity, which is building Worldcoin, remains uninterrupted, a source close to the project told TechCrunch. Altman has &quot;consistent and valuable&quot; engagement with Tools for Humanity and &quot;that is not expected to change,&quot; the source said. The source added that Altman is still chairman and co-founder of the project, confirming that the information on the project&#x27;s website is up to date.
 
News of Altman&#x27;s ouster sent the Worldcoin token, WLD, plummeting to a low of $1.84 on Saturday, but the token recovered over the weekend and is currently trading on par with previous levels at $2.40, per CoinMarketCap data. Worldcoin raised $115 million in May in a Series C round led by Blockchain Capital. As of March, Altman was on the project&#x27;s board, but was not involved in day-to-day operations. &quot;Proof of personhood is becoming increasingly important in the rapidly advancing age of AI,&quot; The Worldcoin Foundation told TechCrunch late on Monday. The team supporting Worldcoin is still focused on the project&#x27;s mission, &quot;building a more human internet and a more accessible global economy through World ID, a privacy-enhancing way to verify humanness and uniqueness online,&quot; the company said.

                              <span>OpenAI&#x27;s &quot;ChatGPT with voice&quot; feature announced in September is now rolling out to all free users on mobile. Engadget reports: When the company first introduced voice chats, it admitted that the capability to create &quot;realistic synthetic voices from just a few seconds of real speech&quot; presents new risks. It could, for instance, allow bad actors to impersonate public figures or anybody they want. As a result, it decided that ChatGPT&#x27;s voice feature will focus on conversations. It&#x27;s powered by a text-to-speech model that can generate &quot;human-like audio from just text and a few seconds of sample speech.&quot; OpenAI worked with voice actors to create the capability and offers five different voices to choose from.

                              <span>Nvidia&#x27;s fiscal third-quarter results surpassed Wall Street&#x27;s predictions, with revenue growing 206% year over year. However, Nvidia shares are down after the company called for a negative impact in the next quarter due to export restrictions affecting sales in China and other countries. CNBC reports: Nvidia&#x27;s revenue grew 206% year over year during the quarter ending Oct. 29, according to a statement. Net income, at $9.24 billion, or $3.71 per share, was up from $680 million, or 27 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago. The company&#x27;s data center revenue totaled $14.51 billion, up 279% and more than the StreetAccount consensus of $12.97 billion. Half of the data center revenue came from cloud infrastructure providers such as Amazon, and the other from consumer internet entities and large companies, Nvidia said. Healthy uptake came from clouds that specialize in renting out GPUs to clients, Kress said on the call.
 
The gaming segment contributed $2.86 billion, up 81% and higher than the $2.68 billion StreetAccount consensus. With respect to guidance, Nvidia called for $20 billion in revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter. That implies nearly 231% revenue growth. [...] Nvidia faces obstacles, including competition from AMD and lower revenue because of export restrictions that can limit sales of its GPUs in China. But ahead of Tuesday report, some analysts were nevertheless optimistic.

                              <span>Bard, Google&#x27;s AI chatbot, has steadily been getting more useful after a lackluster introduction. Now the bot&#x27;s YouTube integration is getting a handy upgrade so it can analyze individual videos to surface specific information for you -- like key points or recipe ingredients -- without ever pressing play. From a report: That&#x27;s potentially a hugely useful tool, but could spell more worry about generative AI for creators. To try it out, I turned Bard on a YouTube video I regularly reference for spiritual guidance: America&#x27;s Test Kitchen&#x27;s recipe for an Espresso Martini. Seriously, it&#x27;s really good. I often find myself in my kitchen with half the ingredients in a cocktail shaker trying to remember how much Benedictine I&#x27;m supposed to add, then re-watching the video to find out. But with Bard on the case, all I have to do is type a few prompts and viola -- I have the full list of ingredients and some step-by-step instructions.

                              <span>OLED monitors risk burn-in, especially with static images. Newer models combat this using improved materials, algorithms, efficiencies, features, and heat management. However, long-term data is minimal as quality selection is recent. An unexpected quirk applies to ultrawides: playing 16:9 content creates brighter center areas versus darker sides, quickening OLED degradation. In an extreme test by RTINGS, Samsung ultrawides developed heavy differential wear in just 700 hours. ArsTechnica adds: Even OLED monitors that have already been released can see their capabilities change in a way that could impact burn-in risk. For example, the Odyssey G8 monitor got a firmware update in August that removed the ability to use the Peak Brightness setting in SDR mode. While this is just one specific mode that, again, some users might not use, it&#x27;s worth noting how this could change the amount of wear an OLED monitor could see. RTINGS&#x27; review said that after the firmware update, the monitor&#x27;s max luminance &quot;when displaying a bright highlight in an SDR scene&quot; went from 331 nits to 230 nits. Samsung hasn&#x27;t confirmed the reasons for this change, but such changes highlight how OLED monitor burn-in risk can change from use to use and from update to update, across different products.

                              <span>HP CEO Enrique Lores is betting a sprinkle of AI dust can regenerate the flagging PC market -- and with shipments still in decline across the industry, he can&#x27;t afford to tease Wall Street. From a report: The world&#x27;s second largest seller of desktop computing hardware has reported a 15 percent year-on-year decline in revenue to $53.7 billion for fiscal 2023 ended 31 October. Profit before tax was $2.93 billion versus $4.32 billion in the prior year. 

[...] Orders picked up in recent months. Analyst data indicates the rate of decline is slowing after resellers began clearing inventory they&#x27;d amassed in the latter stage of the pandemic, when the frenzied buying patterns seen in prior years vanished. For Q4, HP reported revenue of $13.8 billion, down 6.5 percent year-on-year. Personal Systems was down 8 percent to $9.4 billion and Printing was down 3 percent to $4.4 billion. Profit before tax was $852 million, better than the $647 million brought in a year earlier, helped by a reduction in structural costs. HP expects business PC refresh cycles to kick in next year, with more corporate customers shifting their estate to Windows 11 -- yet it is the advent of the AI PC that Lores thinks signal better times.

                              <span>It&#x27;s not your imagination: Airlines are piling on more fees and extra charges, driving up the cost of air travel. From a report: Across the industry, revenue from what&#x27;s known as ancillary sales -- fees for selecting seats, checking bags, and buying food, to name a few -- will reach a record $117.9 billion in 2023. That&#x27;s a 7.7% increase from pre-pandemic records, according to a recent study from airline consultancy firm IdeaWorks and B2B car rental company CarTrawler. 

As plane ticket prices have become more competitive, airlines have turned to ancillary sales to boost profits. And where these fees were once largely confined to low-cost carriers, practices like charging customers for seats and checked luggage are now widespread across all airlines. As the IdeaWorks study points out, carriers like British Airways, Air France, and KLM are now even charging fliers to secure &#x27;better&#x27; business class seats. 

It&#x27;s not simply the fees that are raising hackles. It&#x27;s also how they&#x27;re sold online. Due to the time sensitive nature of airfares, as well as the dozens of upgrades and extras offered as you click through the sales process, airline websites can be ripe environments for what&#x27;s known as dark patterns. Coined in 2010 by Harry Brignull, a UX designer with a doctorate in cognitive science, dark patterns are design strategies used to trick consumers during their purchasing experience and guide them to decisions they would not make otherwise. Airlines employ a range of tactics on their websites, ranging from manipulation to deception, Bringull says. &quot;People need to be aware of their tactics if we want to see changes in the way they operate.&quot;

                              <span>Australia will give cyber health checks for small businesses, increase cyber law enforcement funding and introduce mandatory reporting of ransomware attacks under a security overhaul announced on Wednesday after a spate of attacks. From a report: The federal government said it will also subject telecommunications firms to tougher cyber reporting rules which apply to critical infrastructure, seek migrants to build up the cyber security workforce and set limits on inter-agency data sharing to encourage people to report incidents. The A$587 million ($382 million) plan shows the centre-left Labor government trying to get on the front foot after a year in which nearly half the country&#x27;s 26 million population had personal information stolen in just two data breaches at companies, while a cyber attack at its biggest port operator this month brought supply chains to a standstill.

                              <span>Large earthquakes are always followed by aftershocks -- a series of smaller but still potentially damaging quakes produced as the ground readjusts. But how long does it take for the aftershocks to die out? A new study suggests some areas can experience aftershocks decades or even centuries after the original earthquake. From a report: In earthquake-prone areas it is hard to tell the difference between aftershocks and ordinary background seismicity. But recognising aftershocks is an important part of assessing a region&#x27;s disaster risk. To understand how long aftershocks can persist, researchers turned to the stable continental interior of North America, where earthquakes are uncommon. Using statistical analysis they assessed the timing and clustering of quakes that followed three large magnitude 6.5 to 8 historical earthquakes: one near south-east Quebec in Canada in 1663; a trio of quakes around the Missouri-Kentucky border from 1811 to 1812; and an earthquake in Charleston in South Carolina in 1886. Their results, published in Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth, suggest that the Quebec quake in 1663 has likely shaken itself out, but to their surprise nearly a third of modern quakes in the Missouri-Kentucky area were most likely to be aftershocks from the 1811-12 event, and about 16% of recent quakes in the Charleston region are probably aftershocks from the 1886 quake.

                              <span>In 2018, director Carl Rinsch was courted by multiple studios due to high demand for content, despite his first film being a flop. He pitched a sci-fi series about artificial humans providing aid worldwide, but who are eventually rejected by humans. After a bidding war, Netflix signed an $61 million deal for the unnamed project, giving Rinsch final cut privilege and rights to future seasons - highly unusual moves. 

Soon after, Rinsch&#x27;s behavior grew concerning as he claimed to discover COVID&#x27;s transmission and predict lightning, and he gambled away millions from Netflix on stocks and crypto, The New York Times reported Wednesday. His wife Gabriela Roses worried about his amphetamine use and tried intervening, but he refused rehab. In 2020, Netflix gave Rinsch another $11 million, which he also lost much of on risky bets. 

By mid-2021, Roses informed Netflix executives about Rinsch&#x27;s state and filed for divorce, the Times reported. Netflix consulted police about Rinsch&#x27;s behavior before deciding to stop funding the project in March 2021, though he could shop it elsewhere. Rinsch made $27 million on crypto bets, which he used to buy Rolls-Royces and luxury items. He claims Netflix owes him $14 million more, while Netflix says he never delivered the project milestones to receive additional funding. The confidential arbitration case over the contract dispute concluded this month.

                              <span>As if homesickness, wasting muscles, thinner bones, an elevated cancer risk, the inescapable company of overachievers and the prospect of death in the endless vacuum of space were not enough to contend with, male astronauts may return from deep space prone to erectile dysfunction, scientists say. From a report: In what is claimed to be the first study to assess the impact of galactic radiation and weightlessness on male sexual health, Nasa-funded researchers found that galactic cosmic rays, and to a lesser extent microgravity, can impair the function of erectile tissues, with effects lasting potentially for decades. Raising their concerns in a report on Wednesday, the US researchers said they had identified &quot;a new health risk to consider with deep space exploration.&quot; They called for the sexual health of astronauts to be closely monitored on their return from future deep space missions, noting that certain antioxidants may help to counteract the ill-effects by blocking harmful biological processes. 

&quot;While the negative impacts of galactic cosmic radiation were long-lasting, functional improvements induced by acutely targeting the redox and nitric oxide pathways in the tissues suggest that the erectile dysfunction may be treatable,&quot; said Dr Justin La Favor, an expert in neurovascular dysfunction at Florida State University and a senior author on the study. The warning comes amid a renewed focus on deep space missions, with Nasa and other major space agencies preparing for long-term expeditions to the moon and more ambitious voyages to Mars. Nasa&#x27;s Artemis programme aspires to send astronauts to the moon as early as next year, with crewed missions to Mars tentatively lined up for as early as 2040.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Hello fingerprint authentication has been bypassed on laptops from Dell, Lenovo, and even Microsoft. From a report: Security researchers at Blackwing Intelligence have discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the top three fingerprint sensors that are embedded into laptops and used widely by businesses to secure laptops with Windows Hello fingerprint authentication. Microsoft&#x27;s Offensive Research and Security Engineering (MORSE) asked Blackwing Intelligence to evaluate the security of fingerprint sensors, and the researchers provided their findings in a presentation at Microsoft&#x27;s BlueHat conference in October. 

The team identified popular fingerprint sensors from Goodix, Synaptics, and ELAN as targets for their research, with a newly-published blog post detailing the in-depth process of building a USB device that can perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. Such an attack could provide access to a stolen laptop, or even an &quot;evil maid&quot; attack on an unattended device. A Dell Inspiron 15, Lenovo ThinkPad T14, and Microsoft Surface Pro X all fell victim to fingerprint reader attacks, allowing the researchers to bypass the Windows Hello protection as long as someone was previously using fingerprint authentication on a device. Blackwing Intelligence researchers reverse engineered both software and hardware, and discovered cryptographic implementation flaws in a custom TLS on the Synaptics sensor. The complicated process to bypass Windows Hello also involved decoding and reimplementing proprietary protocols.

                              <span>Rahul Rao reports via Space.com: On Nov. 14, NASA picked up a laser signal fired from an instrument that launched with the Psyche spacecraft, which is currently more than 10 million miles (16 million kilometers) from Earth and heading toward a mysterious metal asteroid. (The spacecraft is at more than 40 times the average distance of Earth&#x27;s moon, and still voyaging afar.) The moment marked the first successful test of NASA&#x27;s Deep Space Optical Communications (DSOC) system, a next-generation comms link that sends information not by radio waves but instead by laser light. It&#x27;s part of a series of tests NASA is doing to speed up communications in deep space, on different missions. &quot;Achieving first light is a tremendous achievement. The ground systems successfully detected the deep space laser photons from DSOC,&quot; Abi Biswas, the system&#x27;s project technologist at NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Southern California, said in an agency statement.
 
&quot;And we were also able to send some data, meaning we were able to exchange &#x27;bits of light&#x27; from and to deep space,&quot; Biswas added.

                              <span>Laura Snapes reports via The Guardian: Spotify is to phase out its service in Uruguay after the passing of a new music copyright bill requiring &quot;fair and equitable remuneration&quot; for authors, composers, performers, directors and screenwriters. In October, the country&#x27;s parliament voted on a budget bill that included two new articles: per article 284, social networks and the internet are to be added &quot;as formats for which, if a song is reproduced, the performer is entitled to financial remuneration&quot; -- namely if a link to a song is shared online. Article 285 will put into copyright law the &quot;right to a fair and equitable remuneration&quot; for all &quot;agreements entered into by authors, composers, performers, directors and screenwriters with respect to their faculty of public communication and making available to the public of phonograms and audiovisual recordings.&quot;
 
In response, Spotify said in a statement on November 20 that without changes to the 2023 Rendicion de Cuentas law, the streaming platform &quot;will, unfortunately, begin to phase out its service in Uruguay effective January 1, 2024&quot; and cease trading in the market in February 2024. The Swedish company seeks confirmation on whether additional costs to be paid to musicians are the responsibility of rights holders or the streaming platforms, arguing that the latter means that it would be required &quot;to pay twice for the same music,&quot; Music Business Worldwide reports. The statement continued: &quot;Spotify already pays nearly 70% of every dollar it generates from music to the record labels and publishers that own the rights for music, and represent and pay artists and songwriters. Any additional payments would make our business untenable.&quot; The platform claimed that it had contributed to a 20% growth in Uruguay&#x27;s music industry in 2022. That year, the South American nation was the 53rd largest market for music.

                              <span>Connor Jones reports via The Register: The government of Canada has confirmed its data was accessed after two of its third-party service providers were attacked. The third parties both provided relocation services for public sector workers and the government is currently analyzing a &quot;significant volume of data&quot; which could date back to 1999. No formal conclusions have yet been made about the number of workers impacted due to the large-scale task of analyzing the relevant data. However, the servers impacted by the breach held data related to current and former Canadian government staff, members of the Canadian armed forces, and Royal Canadian Mounted Police workers -- aka Mounties.
 
&quot;At this time, given the significant volume of data being assessed, we cannot yet identify specific individuals impacted; however, preliminary information indicates that breached information could belong to anyone who has used relocation services as early as 1999 and may include any personal and financial information that employees provided to the companies,&quot; a government statement read. Those who think they may be affected are advised to update any login details that may be similar to those used to access BGRS or Sirva&#x27;s systems. Enabling MFA across all accounts that are used for online transactions is also advised, as is the manual monitoring of personal accounts for any potential malicious activity. Work is currently being carried out to identify and address any vulnerabilities that may have led to the incident, according to the statement.

                              <span>According to Polish news channel TVN24, a secret cryptomining rig was found under the floors of a Polish court, stealing thousands of Polish Zlotys worth of energy per month (the equivalent of roughly $250 per 1,000 Zlotys). &quot;It&#x27;s currently unknown how long the rig was running because the illegal operation went undetected, partly because the computers used were connected to the Internet through their own modems rather than through the court&#x27;s network,&quot; reports Ars Technica. From the report: While no one has been charged yet with any crimes, the court seemingly has suspects. Within two weeks of finding the rig, the court terminated a contract with a company responsible for IT maintenance in the building, TVN24 reported. Before the contract ended, the company fired two employees that it said were responsible for maintenance in the parts of the building where the cryptomine was hidden. Poland&#x27;s top law enforcement officials, the Internal Security Agency, have been called in to investigate. The Warsaw District Prosecutor&#x27;s Office has hired IT experts to help determine exactly how much electricity was stolen from Poland&#x27;s Supreme Administrative Court in Warsaw, TVN24 reported.
 
The Supreme Administrative Court is the last resort for sensitive business and tax disputes, but no records seem to have been compromised. Judge Sylwester Marciniak -- the chairman of the Judicial Information Department of the Supreme Administrative Court -- told TVN24 that the discovery of the cryptomine &quot;did not result in any threat to the security of data stored&quot; in the court.

                              <span>Winston Cho writes via The Hollywood Reporter: A federal judge has dismissed most of Sarah Silverman&#x27;s lawsuit against Meta over the unauthorized use of authors&#x27; copyrighted books to train its generative artificial intelligence model, marking the second ruling from a court siding with AI firms on novel intellectual property questions presented in the legal battle. U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria on Monday offered a full-throated denial of one of the authors&#x27; core theories that Meta&#x27;s AI system is itself an infringing derivative work made possible only by information extracted from copyrighted material. &quot;This is nonsensical,&quot; he wrote in the order. &quot;There is no way to understand the LLaMA models themselves as a recasting or adaptation of any of the plaintiffs&#x27; books.&quot;
 
Another of Silverman&#x27;s arguments that every result produced by Meta&#x27;s AI tools constitutes copyright infringement was dismissed because she didn&#x27;t offer evidence that any of the outputs &quot;could be understood as recasting, transforming, or adapting the plaintiffs&#x27; books.&quot; Chhabria gave her lawyers a chance to replead the claim, along with five others that weren&#x27;t allowed to advance. Notably, Meta didn&#x27;t move to dismiss the allegation that the copying of books for purposes of training its AI model rises to the level of copyright infringement. In July, Silverman and two authors filed a class action lawsuit against Meta and OpenAI for allegedly using their content without permission to train AI language models.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: OpenAI&#x27;s board of directors is reportedly in talks with Sam Altman, ex-Y Combinator president and an OpenAI co-founder, to return to OpenAI as CEO as soon as this week. That&#x27;s according to Bloomberg, which in a brief this morning -- citing sources close to the matter -- said that discussions are happening between Quora CEO Adam D&#x27;Angelo, one current member of the OpenAI board, and Altman -- and possibly other board members as well. Per Bloomberg, the board member (or members) and Altman are discussing a number of possible scenarios that could play out. In one, Altman would return as a director on a transitional board. In another -- or perhaps the same -- former Salesforce Inc. co-CEO Bret Taylor could serve as a director on a new board. …</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: In recent years, lots of American companies have gotten behind a potential climate solution called carbon capture and storage, and the Biden administration has backed it with billions of dollars in tax incentives and direct investments. The idea is to trap planet-heating carbon dioxide from the smokestacks of factories and power plants and transport it to sites where it is injected underground and stored. But the idea is controversial, in large part because the captured carbon dioxide would be shipped to storage sites via thousands of miles of new pipelines. Communities nationwide are pushing back against these pipeline projects and underground sites, arguing they don&#x27;t want the pollution running through their land. 

Now the U.S. Forest Service is proposing to change a rule to allow storing this carbon dioxide pollution under the country&#x27;s national forests and grasslands. &quot;Authorizing carbon capture and storage on NFS lands would support the Administration&#x27;s goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent below the 2005 levels by 2030,&quot; the proposed rule change says. But environmental groups and researchers have concerns. Carbon dioxide pollution will still need to be transported to the forests via industrial pipeline for storage, says June Sekera, a research fellow with Boston University. &quot;To get the CO2 to the injection site in the midst of our national forest, they&#x27;ve got to build huge pipelines,&quot; Sekera says. &quot;All this huge industrial infrastructure that&#x27;s going to go right through.&quot; Sekera says building those CO2 pipelines may require clearing a lot of trees.

From the report: Changpeng Zhao is scheduled to appear in Seattle federal court Tuesday afternoon and enter his plea, the people said. Binance, which Zhao owns, will also plead guilty to a criminal charge and agree to pay fines totaling $4.3 billion, which includes amounts to settle civil allegations made by regulators, the people said. The deal would end long-running investigations of Binance. [...] The deal would allow Zhao to retain his majority ownership of Binance, although he won&#x27;t be able to have an executive role at the company. He would face sentencing at a later date.

                              <span>An anonymous reader writes: Christopher Nolan made headlines earlier this month when he took a playful jab at streaming platforms while discussing the upcoming home release of &quot;Oppenheimer.&quot; The atomic bomb drama, which grossed a staggering $950 million in theaters worldwide, is hitting Blu-ray and other digital platforms this month. Nolan said at a recent &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; screening that it&#x27;s important to own the film on Blu-ray so that &quot;no evil streaming service can come steal it from you.&quot; He told The Washington Post in a follow-up interview: &quot;It was a joke when I said it. But nothing&#x27;s a joke when it&#x27;s transcribed onto the internet. There is a danger, these days, that if things only exist in the streaming version they do get taken down, they come and go,&quot; the director added. 

Streamers have become notoriously known in the last year for pulling original titles from their platforms in order to license them out elsewhere and open up potential revenue streams. When such titles are streaming-only offerings, their removal makes it impossible to view the films elsewhere. Such was the case this year with the Disney+ movie &quot;Crater,&quot; for instance. The streaming-only family adventure was pulled from Disney+ in June and could not be viewed anywhere until it was reissued as a digital release months later in September. For Nolan, owning physical media is the only way to combat such streaming trends. Guillermo del Toro agrees, having shared Nolan&#x27;s recent quotes on X (formerly Twitter) and adding his own commentary on the issue. &quot;Physical media is almost a Fahrenheit 451 (where people memorized entire books and thus became the book they loved) level of responsibility,&quot; del Toro wrote to his followers. &quot;If you own a great 4K HD, Blu-ray, DVD etc etc of a film or films you love...you are the custodian of those films for generations to come.&quot;

                              <span>Computer science teachers around the globe have been left scrambling to find an alternative IDE for their students, after Replit announced it was shuttering its Teams for Education plan. From a report: &quot;To focus on improving the Replit experience for all users, we have made the difficult decision to deprecate Teams for Edu ... Teams for Edu will no longer receive new features or bug fixes, and we will suspend the creation of new Teams and Orgs,&quot; a statement from Replit, shared with educators and brought to our attention on Monday by Reg readers, declared last week. The platform provided a collaborative integrated development environment (IDE) tailored toward classrooms. It allowed students to work together on projects at the same time, similar to Google Docs, as well as automating code evaluation to streamline assessments carried out by teachers. 

The decision has sparked frustration among many educators who&#x27;d invested heavily in the platform since Replit made the plan available for free in early 2022. &quot;Computer science teachers in the last 48 hours have had to scramble to try to find alternatives as soon as possible and it will be the students that suffer,&quot; a teacher based in Asia-Pacific told The Register. &quot;Replit was the only organization we are aware of providing online coding with instant assessment and so it was a hugely popular choice with computer science teachers.&quot; In a Xeet last week, CEO Amjad Masad acknowledged the pain the decision to shut down Teams for Education was likely to cause, but said the current system had become economically nonviable.

                              <span>Using fake names, sham LinkedIn profiles, counterfeit work papers and mock interview scripts, North Korean IT workers seeking employment in Western tech companies are deploying sophisticated subterfuge to get hired. From a report: Landing a job outside North Korea to secretly earn hard currency for the isolated country demands highly-developed strategies to convince Western hiring managers, according to documents reviewed by Reuters, an interview with a former North Korean IT worker and cybersecurity researchers. North Korea has dispatched thousands of IT workers overseas, an effort that has accelerated in the last four years, to bring in millions to finance Pyongyang&#x27;s nuclear missile programme, according to the United States, South Korea, and the United Nations. 

&quot;People are free to express ideas and opinions,&quot; reads one interview script used by North Korean software developers that offers suggestions for how to describe a &quot;good corporate culture&quot; when asked. Expressing one&#x27;s thoughts freely could be met with imprisonment in North Korea. The scripts totalling 30 pages, were unearthed by researchers at Palo Alto Networks, a U.S. cybersecurity firm which discovered a cache of internal documents online that detail the workings of North Korea&#x27;s remote IT workforce. The documents contain dozens of fraudulent resumes, online profiles, interview notes, and forged identities that North Korean workers used to apply for jobs in software development.

                              <span>Sunbird, the app that brings iMessage to Android, has temporarily shut down the service over &quot;security concerns.&quot; From a report: In a notice to users, Sunbird says it has &quot;decided to pause Sunbird usage for now&quot; while it investigates reports that its messages aren&#x27;t actually end-to-end encrypted. Sunbird launched in 2022 as a messaging app that attempts to put the blue versus green bubble battle to rest. It has only been available to those who sign up for its waitlist, touting numerous privacy features, like end-to-end encryption, no message data collection, and no ads. 

Last week, Sunbird partnered with Nothing, the phone brand owned by OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei, on the launch of Nothing Chats. The Sunbird-powered messaging service is supposed to let owners of the Phone 2 send texts via iMessage, but it was pulled from the Google Play Store just one day after its launch. At the time, Nothing said it had to fix &quot;several bugs&quot; within the app. However, its removal from the Play Store came around the same time a post from Texts.blog revealed that messages sent via Sunbird may not be end-to-end encrypted.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Firefox users across the internet say that they are encountering an &quot;artificial&quot; five-second load time when they try to watch YouTube videos that exists on Firefox, but not Chrome. Google, meanwhile, told 404 Media that this is all part of its larger effort against ad blockers, and that it doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with Firefox at all. [...] Mozilla, which makes Firefox, told 404 Media that it does not believe this is a Firefox-specific issue. Enough people have posted about it, however, that it is clearly happening for some users and not others. 

In a statement to 404 Media, Google did not provide specifics but also did not deny implementing an artificial wait time. &quot;To support a diverse ecosystem of creators globally and allow billions to access their favorite content on YouTube, we&#x27;ve launched an effort to urge viewers with ad blockers enabled to allow ads on YouTube or try YouTube Premium for an ad free experience, the spokesperson said. &quot;Users who have ad blockers installed may experience suboptimal viewing, regardless of the browser they are using.&quot;

                              <span>Epic Games Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney testified that Google&#x27;s Android operating system is a &quot;fake open platform&quot; in a high-stakes antitrust lawsuit over claims that the technology giant thwarts app market competition. From a report: Sweeney, who founded the company that makes the blockbuster Fortnite, took the witness stand Monday in San Francisco federal court to reinforce his claims that Google Play policies are unlawful and allow Alphabet to maintain a monopoly in the Android mobile-app distribution market. The court fight started in 2020 when Epic marketed Fortnite on Android and sidestepped the Google Play billing system and the 30% revenue cut it was taking from app developers. 

&quot;We very much wanted to avoid that and do business directly with our customers,&quot; Sweeney told jurors. Google denies abusing its market power. The jury trial started two weeks ago and is expected to wrap up in early December. If Epic prevails, Google could be forced to allow competing app marketplaces and payment methods on its app store, threatening billions of dollars in revenue generated by Google Play. Sweeney previously testified in a 2021 trial in a similar antitrust suit targeting Apple&#x27;s App Store policies as unfair and self-serving. Epic mostly lost that fight, which was decided by a federal judge in Oakland, California, after a trial. An appeals court upheld the judge&#x27;s ruling and Epic is now asking the US Supreme Court to review it.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Verge: Music streaming service Spotify struck a seemingly unique and highly generous deal with Google for Android-based payments, according to new testimony in the Epic v. Google trial. On the stand, Google head of global partnerships Don Harrison confirmed Spotify paid a 0 percent commission when users chose to buy subscriptions through Spotify&#x27;s own system. If the users picked Google as their payment processor, Spotify handed over 4 percent -- dramatically less than Google&#x27;s more common 15 percent fee. Google fought to keep the Spotify numbers private during its antitrust fight with Epic, saying they could damage negotiations with other app developers who might want more generous rates.

                              <span>Last week, Android smartphone manufacturer &quot;Nothing&quot; announced that it&#x27;s bringing iMessage to its newest phone through a new &quot;Nothing Chats&quot; app powered by the messaging platform Sunbird. After launching Friday, the app was shut down within 24 hours and the Sunbird app, which Nothing Chat is a clone of, was put &quot;on pause.&quot; The reason? It&#x27;s a security nightmare. Ars Technica reports: The initial sales pitch for this app -- that it would log you into iMessage on Android if you handed over your Apple username and password -- was a huge security red flag that meant Sunbird would need an ultra-secure infrastructure to avoid disaster. Instead, the app turned out to be about as unsecure as you could possibly be. Here&#x27;s Nothing&#x27;s statement: &quot;We&#x27;ve removed the Nothing Chats beta from the Play Store…</span>

                              <span>In an interview with CNBC&#x27;s Jon Fortt today, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that the governance structure of OpenAI needs to change after the AI company&#x27;s sudden firing of CEO Sam Altman. &quot;At this point, I think it&#x27;s very clear that something has to change around the governance,&quot; Nadella said. He added that Microsoft would have &quot;a good dialogue with their board on that.&quot;
 
Unlike traditional private company boards, OpenAI&#x27;s board consists mostly of outsiders and isn&#x27;t tasked with maximizing shareholder value. &quot;[N]one of them hold equity in OpenAI,&quot; notes The Verge. &quot;Instead, their stated mission is to ensure the creation of &#x27;broadly beneficial&#x27; artificial general intelligence, or AGI.&quot; From the report: In his first press interview since Altman&#x27;s ouster, Nadella dismissed concerns of long…</span>

In late September, multiple commercial flights near Iran went astray after navigation systems went blind. The planes first received spoofed GPS signals, meaning signals designed to fool planes&#x27; systems into thinking they are flying miles away from their real location. One of the aircraft almost flew into Iranian airspace without permission. Since then, air crews discussing the problem online have said it&#x27;s only gotten worse, and experts are racing to establish who is behind it.

                              <span>According to Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman, Apple plans to ditch Qualcomm and build its own custom modem that could launch around 2026. MacRumors reports: Writing in his latest Power On newsletter, Gurman says that Apple&#x27;s custom technology aspirations include integrating an in-house modem into its system-on-a-chip (SoC), which would eventually see the launch of MacBooks with built-in cellular connectivity. Gurman says Apple will &quot;probably need two or three additional years to get that chip inside cellular versions of the Apple Watch and iPad -- and the Mac, once the part is integrated into the company&#x27;s system-on-a-chip.&quot;
 
Apple has explored the possibility of developing MacBooks with cellular connectivity in the past. Indeed, the company reportedly considered launching a MacBook Air with 3G connectivity, but former CEO Steve Jobs said in 2008 that Apple decided against it, since it would take up too much room in the case. An integrated SoC would solve that problem. Gurman&#x27;s latest newsletter also said some of Apple&#x27;s other ongoing in-house chip projects include camera sensors, batteries, a combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip that will eventually replace parts from Broadcom, Micro-LED displays for Apple devices, and a non-invasive glucose monitoring system.

                              <span>Firefox 120 will be available tomorrow, bringing support for the Global Privacy Control &quot;Sec-GPC&quot; request header to indicate whether a user consents to a website or service selling or sharing their personal information with third parties. It&#x27;s also enabling the WebAssembly GC extension by default, opening up new languages like Dart and Kotlin to run in the browser. Phoronix&#x27;s Michael Larabel highlights some of the other features included in this release: - Ubuntu Linux users now have the ability to import data from Chromium when both are installed as Snap packages.
- Picture-in-Picture mode now supports corner snapping on Windows and Linux.
- Support for the light-dark() CSS color function that allows setting of colors for both light and dark without needing to use the prefers-color-scheme media feature. This allows conveniently specifying the preferred light color theme value followed by the dark color theme value.
- CSS support for the lh and rlh line height units.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Reuters: Apple has been sued by Venmo and Cash App customers in a proposed class action claiming the iPhone maker abused its market power to curb competition for mobile peer-to-peer payments, causing consumers to pay &quot;rapidly inflating prices.&quot; Four consumers in New York, Hawaii, South Carolina and Georgia filed the lawsuit (PDF) on Friday in San Jose, California, federal court. They alleged Apple violated U.S. antitrust law through its agreements with PayPal&#x27;s Venmo and Block&#x27;s Cash App.
 
Apple&#x27;s agreements limit &quot;feature competition&quot; within peer-to-peer payment apps, including prohibiting existing or new platforms from using &quot;decentralized cryptocurrency technology,&quot; the complaint said. The lawsuit seeks an injunction that could force Apple to divest or segregate its Apple Cash business.

                              <span>The use of environmentally damaging gases in air conditioners and refrigerators could become redundant if a new kind of heat pump lives up to its promise. A prototype, described in a study published last week in Science, uses electric fields and a special ceramic instead of alternately vaporizing a refrigerant fluid and condensing it with a compressor to warm or cool air. From a report: The technology combines a number of existing techniques and has &quot;superlative performance,&quot; says Neil Mathur, a materials scientist at the University of Cambridge, UK. Emmanuel Defay, a materials scientist at the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology in Belvaux, and his collaborators built their experimental device out of a ceramic with a strong electrocaloric effect. Materials that exhibit this effect heat up when exposed to electric fields. 

In an electrocaloric material, the atoms have an electric polarization -- a slight imbalance in their distribution of electrons, which gives these atoms a &#x27;plus&#x27; and a &#x27;minus&#x27; pole. When the material is left alone, the polarization of these atoms continuously swivels around in random directions. But when the material is exposed to an electric field, all the electrostatic poles suddenly align, like hair combed in one direction. This transition from disorder to order means that the electrons&#x27; entropy -- physicists&#x27; way of measuring disorder -- suddenly drops, Defay explains. But the laws of thermodynamics say that the total entropy of a system can never decline, so if it falls somewhere it must increase somewhere else. &quot;The only possibility for the material to get rid of this extra mess is to pour it into the lattice&quot; of its crystal structure, he says. That extra disorder means that the atoms themselves start vibrating faster, resulting in a rise in temperature.

From a report: Negotiations between the Justice Department and Binance include the possibility that its founder Changpeng Zhao would face criminal charges in the US under an agreement to resolve the probe into alleged money laundering, bank fraud and sanctions violations, according to people familiar with the discussions. Zhao, also known as &quot;CZ,&quot; is residing in the United Arab Emirates, which doesn&#x27;t have an extradition treaty with the US, but that doesn&#x27;t prevent him from coming voluntarily. An announcement could come as soon as the end of the month, though the situation remains fluid, according to the people, who asked not to be named discussing a confidential matter.

From his op-ed: I was the first venture investor in OpenAI. The weekend drama illustrated my contention that the wrong boards can damage companies. Fancy titles like &quot;Director of Strategy at Georgetown&#x27;s Center for Security and Emerging Technology&quot; can lead to a false sense of understanding of the complex process of entrepreneurial innovation. OpenAI&#x27;s board members&#x27; religion of &quot;effective altruism&quot; and its misapplication could have set back the world&#x27;s path to the tremendous benefits of artificial intelligence. Imagine free doctors for everyone and near free tutors for every child on the planet. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s at stake with the promise of AI.

                              <span>The world is on track for a &quot;hellish&quot; 3C of global heating, the UN has warned before the crucial Cop28 climate summit that begins next week in the United Arab Emirates. From a report: The report found that today&#x27;s carbon-cutting policies are so inadequate that 3C of heating would be reached this century. Temperature records have already been obliterated in 2023 and intensifying heatwaves, floods and droughts have taken lives and hit livelihoods across the globe, in response to a temperature rise of 1.4C to date. Scientists say far worse is to come if temperatures continue to rise. The secretary general of the UN, Antonio Guterres, has said repeatedly the world is heading for a &quot;hellish&quot; future. 

The UN Environment Programme (Unep) report said that implementing future policies already promised by countries would shave 0.1C off the 3C limit. Putting in place emissions cuts pledged by developing countries on condition of receiving financial and technical support would cut the temperature rise to 2.5C, still a catastrophic scenario. To get on track for the internationally agreed target of 1.5C, 22bn tonnes of CO2 must be cut from the currently projected total in 2030, the report said. That is 42% of global emissions and equivalent to the output of the world&#x27;s five worst polluters: China, US, India, Russia and Japan.

                              <span>OpenAI was in open revolt on Monday with 490 employees threatening to leave unless the board resigns and reinstates Sam Altman as CEO, along with cofounder and former president Greg Brockman. Altman was controversially fired by the board on Friday. From a report: &quot;The process through which you terminated Sam Altman and removed Greg Brockman from the board has jeopardized all of this work and undermined our mission and company&quot; the letter reads. &quot;Your conduct has made it clear you did not have the competence to oversee OpenAI.&quot; Remarkably, the letter&#x27;s signees include Ilya Sutskever, the company&#x27;s chief scientist and a member of its board, who has been blamed for coordinating the boardroom coup against Altman in the first place. 

Shortly before the letter was released, Sutskever posted on X: &quot;I deeply regret my participation in the board&#x27;s actions. I never intended to harm OpenAI. I love everything we&#x27;ve built together and I will do everything I can to reunite the company.&quot; The letter&#x27;s release follows an extraordinary, head-spinning weekend in Silicon Valley. OpenAI&#x27;s board removed Altman from his position on Friday, claiming &quot;he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities.&quot;

                              <span>Microsoft has hired OpenAI co-founders Sam Altman and Greg Brockman to head up a &quot;new advanced AI research team,&quot; the software conglomerate&#x27;s chief Satya Nadella said Monday, capping three days of intense discussions following the unexpected decision by OpenAI&#x27;s board to dismiss Altman. From a report: Many OpenAI members, including the co-founder Brockman, left the firm in protest last week. Altman will serve as the chief executive of the new AI group at Microsoft, Nadella said. &quot;We&#x27;ve learned a lot over the years about how to give founders and innovators space to build independent identities and cultures within Microsoft, including GitHub, Mojang Studios, and LinkedIn, and I&#x27;m looking forward to having you do the same.&quot; Nadella said Altman and Brockman will be joined by &quot;colleagues.&quot; Former OpenAI top talent Szymon Sidor, Jakub Pachocki, Aleksander Madry are joining Microsoft with &quot;more&quot; to follow suit, Brockman said in a post on X.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this report from ZDNet:

At the Linux Plumbers Conference, the invite-only meeting for the top Linux kernel developers, ByteDance Linux Kernel Engineer Cong Wang, proposed that we use AI and machine learning to tune the Linux kernel for the maximum results for specific workloads... There are thousands of parameters. Even for a Linux expert, tuning them for optimal performance is a long, hard job. And, of course, different workloads require different tunings for different sets of Linux kernel parameters... What ByteDance is working on is a first attempt to automate the entire Linux kernel parameter tuning process with minimal engineering efforts. 

Specifically, ByteDance is working on tuning Linux memory management. ByteDance has found that with machine learning algorithms, such as Bayesian optimization, automated tuning could even beat most Linux kernel engineers. Why? Well, the idea, as Wang wryly put it, &quot;is not to put Linux kernel engineers out of business.&quot; No, the goal is &quot;to liberate human engineers from tuning performance for each individual workload. While making better decisions with historical data, which humans often struggle with. And, last, but never least, find better solutions than those we come up with using our current trial and error, heuristic methods. 

In short, ByteDance&#x27;s system optimizes resource usage by making real-time adjustments to things like CPU frequency scaling and memory management.

                              <span>Today saw the end of IFComp.org&#x27;s 29th annual text adventure competition (now administered by the charitable non-profit IF Technology Foundation). 74 new and original text adventures
 competed for a share of the $7,523 prize pool, with the winners announced in a special online ceremony on Twitch this afternoon. 

After all the votes were tabulated, the winning game was Dr Ludwig and the Devil, a 90-minute epic in which an esteemed mad scientist tries to double-cross Beelzebub himself — along with &quot;the world&#x27;s least effective torch and pitchfork-wielding mob!&quot; Coming in second was LAKE Adventure. (Its premise? That it&#x27;s a 13-year-old&#x27;s 1993 game being revisited by its author 28 years later — complete with some gloriously retro artwork.) And finishing third was The Little Match Girl 4 (described as &quot;a touching epic time travel fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen.) 

But also this week, the owner of the web site 80sNostalgia.com has created a text adventure using nothing but inter-linked posts on Threads. 
&quot;Think you can get under The Bridge?&quot; its first post challenges. &quot;Test your gaming skills with this Threads exclusive text-based game!

You are an individual contributor at heart. You like writing code and solving technical problems. You dislike meetings and ceremony. Here’s what you can do to maximize what you like and minimize what you don’t: radiate information.

The daily standup meetings that Scrum popularized have bad press for a reason. The daily periodicity is way too much. And using a recurring meeting to give people a chance to catch up is atrociously disruptive and inefficient. But the questions themselves make sense: What did you do? What are you going to do? Are there any blockers? You should aim to communicate that information routinely, just not in a meeting.

The Washington Post explains...


McIntyre, who served as publisher at Razorbill, an imprint of Penguin Random House, was diagnosed in 2019 and proceeded through treatment without taking on debt, [husband Andrew Rose] Gregory told The Washington Post. But many fellow cancer patients she met were in more precarious financial positions, Gregory added. &quot;We were both so keenly aware that Casey had great health insurance through Penguin Random House,&quot; said Gregory, 41. &quot;Casey had no medical debt....&quot; 

About nine months before McIntyre died, her husband came across a video online about members of a North Carolina…</span>

In a blog post they call the updates &quot;an initiative that has become a cornerstone of the IT world&#x27;s approach to cybersecurity.&quot;
Originating from the Trustworthy Computing memo by Bill Gates in 2002, our unwavering commitment to protecting customers continues to this day and is reflected in Microsoft&#x27;s Secure Future Initiative announced this month. Each month, we deliver security updates on the second Tuesday, underscoring our pledge to cyber defense. As we commemorate this milestone, it&#x27;s worth exploring the inception of Patch Tuesday and its evolution through the years, demonstrating our adaptability to new technology and emerging cyber threats...

As use of high performance computing becomes ubiquitous in scientific computing and digital engineering, and AI use cases multiply, more and more data centers deploy GPUs and other compute accelerators.

But &quot;we condemn the use of unauthorized, confusing derivatives of the licenses.&quot;
Unfortunately, some authors engage in confusing practices by drafting licenses using existing terms and conditions of GNU free software licenses, without the intention of granting all four freedoms to users. For example, we have long seen attempts to add restrictions to the license text itself, placed in the LICENSE file, or included elsewhere in the program&#x27;s release. An example is the so-called &quot;Commons Clause,&quot; which, when applied to a free software license, affirms that the program is covered by the license. But, at the same time, is c…</span>

                              <span>&quot;And no, it&#x27;s not COBOL,&quot; jokes long-time Slashdot reader schwit1, sharing this report from ScienceAlert:


A secret text has been discovered in Türkiye, scattered among tens of thousands of ancient clay tablets, which were written in the time of the Hittite Empire during the second millennium BCE. No one yet knows what the curious cuneiform script says, but it seems to be a long-lost language from more than 3,000 years ago. 

Experts say the mysterious idiom is unlike any other ancient written language found in the Middle East, although it seems to share roots with other Anatolian-Indo-European languages. The sneaky scrawlings start at the end of a cultic ritual text written in Hittite — the oldest known Indo-European tongue — after an introduction that essentially translates to: &quot;From now on, read in the language of the country of Kalasma&quot;...

Currently, there are no available photos of the newly discovered tablet with Kalamaic writings, as experts are still working out how to translate it. Schwemer and his colleagues hope to publish their results along with images of their discovery sometime next year.

                              <span>Python &quot;come with downsides,&quot; argues a new article in Communications of the ACM. &quot;Its programs tend to run slowly, and because it is inefficient at running processes in parallel, it is not well suited to some of the latest AI programming.&quot; 


&quot;Hoping to overcome those difficulties, computer scientist Chris Lattner set out to create a new language, Mojo, which offers the ease of use of Python, but the performance of more complex languages such as C++ or Rust.&quot; Lattner tells the site &quot;we don&#x27;t want to break Python, we want to make Python better,&quot; while software architect Doug Meil says Mojo is essentially &quot;Python for AI... and it&#x27;s going to be way faster in scale across multiple hardware platforms.&quot;

                              <span>Recently the Register pointed out that the new (Debian-based) Raspberry Pi OS 5.0 has &quot;a completely new Wayland desktop environment replacing PIXEL, the older desktop based on LXDE and X.org, augmented with Mutter in its previous release.&quot; 

And when elementary OS 8 finally arrives, &quot;the development team plans to finally shift to the Wayland display server by default,&quot; reports Linux magazine (adding &quot;If you&#x27;d like to get early access to daily builds, you can do so by becoming an elementary OS sponsor on GitHub.&quot;) 

&quot;This is a transition that we have been planning and working towards for several years,&quot; writes CEO/co-founder Danielle Foré, &quot;and we&#x27;re finally in the home stretch... Wayland will bring us improved performance, better app security, and opens the doors to support more complex display setups like mixed DPI multi-monitor setups.&quot;
There are other things that we&#x27;re experimenting with, like the possibility of an immutable OS, and there are more mundane things that will certainly happen like shipping Pipewire. You&#x27;ll also see on the project board that we&#x27;re looking to replace the onscreen keyboard and it&#x27;s time to re-evaluate some things like SystemD Boot. You can expect lots more little features to be detailed over the coming months. 

Meanwhile, Linux Mint is getting &quot;experimental&quot; Wayland support next month. And also in December, Firefox will let Wayland support be enabled by default. 

And last month the Register noted a merge request for GNOME to remove the gnome-xorg.desktop file. &quot;To put this in context, the Fedora project is considering a comparable change: removing or hiding the GNOME on X.org session from the login menu, which is already the plan for the Fedora KDE spin when it moves to KDE version 6, which is still in development.&quot;

Whatever comes next will be neither simply organic nor simply machinic but will be the result of the increasingly symbiotic relationship between human beings and technology. Bound together as parasite/host, neither people nor technologies can exist apart from the other because they are constitutive prostheses of each other... So-called &quot;artificial&quot; intelligence is the latest extension of the emergent process through which life takes ever more diverse and complex forms. 

The article lists &quot;four trajectories that will be increasingly important for the symbiotic relationship between humans and machines.&quot;

CNN reports that disinformation operation is even &quot;at times threatening its targets with violence, a CNN review of court documents and public disclosures by social media companies has found.&quot;

The onslaught of attacks — often of a vile and deeply personal nature — is part of a well-organized, increasingly brazen Chinese government intimidation campaign targeting people in the United States, documents show.

JetBrains&#x27; Kotlin language, a Java rival endorsed by Google for Android mobile development, continues to scale up Tiobe&#x27;s index of language popularity, reaching the 15th spot in the November 2023 rankings... 

Software quality services company Tiobe cites Kotlin advantages including interoperability with Java and unrivaled Android accommodations as reasons for the language&#x27;s rise. Kotlin, Tiobe CEO Paul Jansen said, also fits in with a modern programming culture of expressive languages that have a strong type system and avoid null pointer exceptions by design. &quot;Based on my experience, I am pretty sure Kotlin can reach a top 10 position,&quot; Jansen said. It remains to be seen if it can ever scale as high as a top four slot, he added... 
In the rival Pypl Popularity of Programming languages index this month, Kotlin was ranked 13th with a 1.76% share, having slipped slightly year-over-year. 

Kotlin&#x27;s rank on the TIOBE index rose three positions in the last month — after rising two positions the month before. TIOBE&#x27;s CEO says the language has now achieved its highest ranking ever on the index, surpassing 2017&#x27;s &quot;first wave of Kotlin popularity...when Google announced first class support for Kotlin on Android.&quot; 
Rust now ranks #20 on the index, behind Delphi/Object Pascal, Swift, Ruby, and R.

there&#x27;s no query plan walking infrastructure or I just didn&#x27;t find it.

                              <span>Bill Gates argues that when it comes to climate change, &quot;there are more reasons to be hopeful than many people realize — and it&#x27;s not just that renewable energy sources like wind and solar are getting cheaper. 

&quot;And it&#x27;s not just because many of the steps already taken to reduce carbon emissions are working: Carbon emissions from fossil fuels will probably peak in 2025.&quot;
The main thing that makes me optimistic is all the innovation I&#x27;m seeing. As someone who has been funding climate solutions for years, I get to learn from ingenious scientists who are working on ideas that will help the world solve climate change. And their work makes me confident that innovation will help the world get on track to meet its climate goals.

Now the other piece of the puzzle is available: the source code (mostly in assembly, with some C and Pascal) to their microcomputer interpreters.

 Infocom, publisher of the best-selling Zork series, ported their text adventures to most of the diverse microcomputer platforms of the 1980s by using an early virtual machine, known as the Z-machine or ZIP. This enabled them to sell games simultaneously for everything from the TI-99/4A to the Commodore 128. Hobbyists reverse-engineered the technology in the 1990s to create modern implementations, but now the original source code can be studied directly.

In brief, Rust Linux is continuing to mature and is getting strong support from developers and vendors, such as Cisco, Samsung, and Canonical... Rust is taking the steps it needs to become — along with C — a fully-fledged member of the Linux language toolchain... That&#x27;s not to say that we&#x27;re ready to retire C for Rust just yet. In fact, that day is unlikely ever to come. But Rust is definitely on its way to becoming an important language for Linux development... 

As for the day-to-day work that&#x27;s required to make Rust fully integrated with Linux, the &quot;official&quot; website of the initiative is now the se…</span>

                              <span>&quot;NFTs aren&#x27;t gone yet,&quot; writes the Verge. 

&quot;Disney will launch an &#x27;all-new socially driven collectible experience&#x27; called Disney Pinnacle later this year, turning characters from Pixar, Star Wars, and its classic animated films into tradable digital pins.&quot;


While announcing Pinnacle, Disney and its partner Dapper Labs won&#x27;t even say the word &quot;NFT.&quot; Dapper Labs still calls itself &quot;the NFT company,&quot; but between a variety of scams, an eye-blistering episode at a recent Bored Ape event, and a market that has plunged since peaking in early 2021, that&#x27;s a term they apparently will steer clear of. The only thing available on the site right now is a privacy policy that makes clear this is a Dapper Labs effort that&#x27;s licensing content from Disney — not an in-house effort on the level of Disney Plus. 

The NFT collection is being launched through an iOS app, and a spokesperson tells CoinDesk that web and Android applications will come later.

 
The Disney Pinnacle website has a few seconds of background animation showing the pins — and, of course, a waitlist signup form.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s stock price plumetted 16% after OpenAI fired CEO Sam Altman — but appears to have immediately recovered most of the drop in after-hours trading. Yet OpenAI&#x27;s move &quot;also blindsided key investor and minority owner Microsoft,&quot; writes Ars Technica, &quot;reportedly making CEO Satya Nadella furious.&quot; 


Tech reporter Kara Swisher called the firing a &quot;badly managed coup de Sam,&quot; tweeting more details Friday night. &quot;Sources tell me that the profit direction of the company under Altman and the speed of development, which could be seen as too risky, and the nonprofit side dedicated to more safety and caution were at odds. One person on the Sam side called it a &#x27;coup,&#x27; while another said it was the the right move.&quot;

                              <span>CNN reports

SpaceX made a second attempt to successfully launch Starship, the most powerful rocket ever constructed. The uncrewed rocket took off just after 7 a.m. CT (8 a.m. ET). The rocket took off as intended, making it roughly 8 minutes into flight before SpaceX confirmed it had to intentionally explode the Starship spacecraft as it flew over the ocean... 

This mission comes after months of back-and-forth with federal regulators as SpaceX has awaited a launch license. The company is also grappling with pushback from environmentalists... 

After separating from the Super Heavy rocket booster, the Starship spacecraft soared to an altitude of approximately 93 miles (150 kilometers) before SpaceX lost contact, according to a statement issued by the company. For context, the U.S. government considers 50 miles (80 kilometers) above Earth&#x27;s surface the edge of outer space... 

SpaceX is OK with rockets exploding in the early stages of development. That&#x27;s because the company uses a completely different approach to rocket design than, say, NASA. The space agency focuses on building one rocket and strenuously designing and testing it on the ground before its first flight — taking years but all but guaranteeing success on the first launch. SpaceX, however, rapidly builds new prototypes and is willing to test them to their breaking point because there&#x27;s usually a spare nearby. During a drive by the company&#x27;s facilities on Friday — four Starship spacecraft and at least two Super Heavy boosters could be seen from public roadways. 
CNN reminds readers that &quot;so far in 2023 alone, the Falcon 9 has launched more than 70 spaceflights... 


&quot;Elon Musk described Starship as the vehicle that underpins SpaceX&#x27;s founding purpose: sending humans to Mars for the first time. NASA has its own plans for the rocket.&quot;

The article notes a threat assessment from U.S. Space Force Chief Master Sergeant Ron Lerch:

What&#x27;s most concerning isn&#x27;t the swarm of satellites but the types. &quot;We know that there are kinetic kill vehicles,&quot; Lerch said — for example, a Russian &quot;nesting doll&quot; satellite, in which a big satellite releases a tiny one and the tiny one releases a mechanism that can strike and damage another satellite. There are machines with the ability to cast nets and extend grappling hooks, too. China, whose presence in space now far outpaces Russia&#x27;s, is launching unmanned &quot;space planes&quot; into orbit, testing potentially unbreakable quantum comm…</span>

Three weeks ago a new podcast launched with Python core developer/steering council member Pablo Galindo and Python developer-in-residence Åukasz Langa.

This month the Python Sofware Foundation announced its seventh Python Developers Survey. 

And for the fifth year in a row the foundation partnered with JetBrains to offer a 30% discount on JetBrains&#x27; dedicated Python Integrated Development Environment &quot;PyCharm&quot; — with all proceeds benefitting the Python Software Foundation (&quot;The discount will be automatically applied when you check out. The promotion will only be available through November 27th...&quot;) 

A PSF blog post about the fundraiser notes you can also just make a direct donation to the Python Software Foundation, or sign up to become a foundation member to &quot;help us sustain what we do.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from SecurityWeek: Moving to clamp down on the growing scourge of SIM-swapping and port-out fraud, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has unveiled new rules mandating telcos to give consumers greater control of their mobile phone accounts. Under the new rules, wireless carriers are required to notify customers of any SIM transfer requests, a measure designed to thwart fraudulent attempts by cybercriminals. The FCC has also revised its customer proprietary network information and local number portability rules, making it more challenging for scammers to access sensitive subscriber information.
 
The new protective measures (PDF) are meant to address SIM-swapping and port-out attacks widely documented in cybercriminal attacks against businesses and consumers. The attack technique is used to hijack mobile accounts, change and steal passwords, bypass MFA roadblocks and raid bank accounts. Studies have found that major mobile carriers in the US are vulnerable to SIM-swapping with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) receiving thousands of consumer complaints every year.

                              <span>The world&#x27;s largest single-site solar farm has gone online in the United Arab Emirates. Called the Al Dhafra solar farm, it features almost 4 million bifacial solar panels and will power nearly 200,000 homes -- all while eliminating 2.4 million tons of carbon emissions annually. Electrek reports: Now that Al Dhafra is online, the UAE&#x27;s solar power production capacity has increased to 3.2 GW. In September, EWEC called for proposals to develop a 1.5 GW solar farm in Al Khazna near Abu Dhabi. UAE is aiming to triple its renewable energy capacity to 14 GW by 2030. The UAE is hosting COP28 in Dubai, which kicks off on November 30, so, understandably, its rulers would time the launch of the world&#x27;s largest solar farm just ahead of that event -- it&#x27;s simply good PR.
 
UAE is rightly being criticized for putting the CEO of its state oil company, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company -- the world&#x27;s 12th-biggest oil company by production -- in charge of COP28. It&#x27;s also being criticized for hosting COP28 yet having an all-of-the-above approach to energy. The UAE Energy Strategy 2050 targets an energy mix of 44% clean energy, 38% gas, 12% &quot;clean coal&quot; (yes, it really says that), and 6% nuclear. It says it will become carbon neutral by 2050, but how it will do that on 50% fossil fuels is anyone&#x27;s guess.

                              <span>According to a new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine, women in the U.S. are now projected to live about six years longer than U.S. men. TIME reports: [T]he 2021 data represent the largest gender-based life expectancy gap in the U.S. since 1996. The gulf began to widen before the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors note, but the trend accelerated from 2019 to 2021. Deaths from COVID-19 and unintentional injuries, a category that includes accidental drug overdoses, were the largest contributors to the widening of the gap, but differential rates of homicide, heart disease, and suicide deaths also played a role, according to the report. It&#x27;s well-established that men die of these causes more frequently than women, and in recent years, they have been some of the most common causes of death overall. Heart disease, COVID-19, and unintentional injuries accounted for three of the top five in 2021.
 
The gender gap would have been even wider, the authors note, but for factors including increases in maternal mortality and decreases in cancer deaths among men. Overall, the data underscore the continued importance of limiting COVID-19&#x27;s spread, and of finding better ways to improve national mental health and prevent drug overdoses and suicides -- fatalities sometimes labeled by experts as &quot;deaths of despair.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: This Sunday, November 19, makes a full 25 years since the original Half-Life first hit (pre-Steam) store shelves. To celebrate the anniversary, Valve has uploaded a feature-packed &quot;25th anniversary update&quot; to the game on Steam, and made the title free to keep if you pick it up this weekend. Valve&#x27;s 25th Anniversary Update page details a bevy of new and modernized features added to the classic first-person shooter, including:
 - Four new multiplayer maps that &quot;push the limits of what&#x27;s possible in the Half-Life engine&quot; - New graphics settings, including support for a widescreen field-of-view on modern monitors and OpenGL Overbright lighting (still no official ray-tracing support, though-leave that to the modders) - &quot;Proper gamepad config out of the box&quot; (so dust off that Gravis Gamepad Pro) - Steam networking support for easier multiplayer setup - &quot;Verified&quot; support for Steam Deck play (&quot;We failed super hard&quot; on the first verification attempt, Valve writes) - Proper UI scaling for resolutions up to 3840x1600 - Multiplayer balancing updates (because 25 years hasn&#x27;t been enough to perfect the meta) - New entity limits that allow mod makers to build more complex mods - A full software renderer for the Linux version of the game - Various bug fixes - &quot;Removed the now very unnecessary &#x27;Low video quality. Helps with slower video cards&#x27; setting&quot;
 
In addition, the new update includes a host of restored and rarely seen content, including:
 - Three multiplayer maps from the &quot;Half-Life: Further Data&quot; CD-ROM: Double Cross, Rust Mill, and Xen DM - Four restored multiplayer models: Ivan the Space Biker, Proto-Barney (from the alpha build), a skeleton, and Too Much Coffee Man (from &quot;Further Data&quot;) - Dozens of &quot;Further Data&quot; sprays to tag in your multiplayer matches - The original Half-Life: Uplink demo in playable form

                              <span>New submitter doc1623 shares a report from Wired: Swedish workers are uniting against Tesla. [Starting Friday], cleaners will stop cleaning Tesla showrooms, electricians won&#x27;t fix the company&#x27;s charging points, and dockworkers will refuse to unload Tesla cargo at all Swedish ports. What started as a strike by Tesla mechanics is spreading, in something Swedish unions describe as an existential battle between Elon Musk&#x27;s carmaker and the conventions they say make the country&#x27;s labor market fair and efficient. The standoff in Sweden is the biggest union action the company has faced anywhere in the world. Sweden doesn&#x27;t have laws that set working conditions, such as a minimum wage. Instead these rules are dictated by collective agreements, a type of contract that defines the benefits employees…</span>

                              <span>The newly updated U.S. Department of Agriculture&#x27;s &quot;plant hardiness zone map&quot; has gardeners across the nation researching what new plants they can grow in their warming regions, as the 2023 map is about 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the 2012 map. NPR reports: This week the map got its first update in more than a decade, and the outlook for many gardens looks warmer. The 2023 map is about 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the 2012 map across the contiguous U.S., says Chris Daly, director of the PRISM Climate Group at Oregon State University that jointly developed the map with the USDA. Daly says the new map means about half the country has shifted into a new half zone and half hasn&#x27;t. In some locations, people may find they can grow new types of flowers, fruits, vegetables and plants.
 
Daly says he is hesitant to explicitly attribute the specific changes from the 2012 map to the 2023 map to climate change because of the volatility of the key statistic they used to create this map. They were mapping &quot;the coldest night of the year, each year, over the past 30 years&quot;, Daly says, and it&#x27;s a highly variable figure. In an email, a press officer for the USDA says, &quot;Changes to plant hardiness zones are not necessarily reflective of global climate change because of the highly variable nature of the extreme minimum temperature of the year.&quot; But Daly says, in the big picture, climate change is playing a role in changing what grows where in the US: &quot;Over the long run, we will expect to see a slow shifting northward of zones as climate change takes hold.&quot;

There would be no change in product roadmap as a result of his decision, she added.

                              <span>A court in Canada struck down a regulation classifying some plastic products as toxic, &quot;a ruling that could hurt a push by Ottawa to ban single-use plastic items like bags, straws and forks.&quot; From the report: A ban on manufacturing and importing &quot;harmful&quot; single-use plastics came into effect last December after the federal government formally drew up a order that added them to a list of toxic items. But the Federal Court in Ottawa overturned that decision, calling the listing &quot;unreasonable and unconstitutional.&quot; The case was brought by plastics manufacturers such as Dow Inc as well as Imperial Oil.
 
The office of Environment Minister Stephen Guilbeault said it was considering an appeal. &quot;We strongly believe in taking action to tackle this crisis and keep millions of garbage bags worth of trash off our beaches, out of our waters, and away from nature,&quot; spokeswoman Kaitlin Power said in a statement.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: On Wednesday, Replicate developer Charlie Holtz combined GPT-4 Vision (commonly called GPT-4V) and ElevenLabs voice cloning technology to create an unauthorized AI version of the famous naturalist David Attenborough narrating Holtz&#x27;s every move on camera. As of Thursday afternoon, the X post describing the stunt had garnered over 21,000 likes. &quot;Here we have a remarkable specimen of Homo sapiens distinguished by his silver circular spectacles and a mane of tousled curly locks,&quot; the false Attenborough says in the demo as Holtz looks on with a grin. &quot;He&#x27;s wearing what appears to be a blue fabric covering, which can only be assumed to be part of his mating display.&quot; &quot;Look closely at the subtle arch of his eyebrow,&quot; it continues, as if narrating a BBC wildlife documentary. &quot;It&#x27;s as if he&#x27;s in the midst of an intricate ritual of curiosity or skepticism. The backdrop suggests a sheltered habitat, possibly a communal feeding area or watering hole.&quot;
 
How does it work? Every five seconds, a Python script called &quot;narrator&quot; takes a photo from Holtz&#x27;s webcam and feeds it to GPT-4V -- the version of OpenAI&#x27;s language model that can process image inputs -- via an API, which has a special prompt to make it create text in the style of Attenborough&#x27;s narrations. Then it feeds that text into an ElevenLabs AI voice profile trained on audio samples of Attenborough&#x27;s speech. Holtz provided the code (called &quot;narrator&quot;) that pulls it all together on GitHub, and it requires API tokens for OpenAI and ElevenLabs that cost money to run. During the demo video, when Holtz holds up a cup and takes a drink, the fake Attenborough narrator says, &quot;Ah, in its natural environment, we observe the sophisticated Homo sapiens engaging in the critical ritual of hydration. This male individual has selected a small cylindrical container, likely filled with life-sustaining H2O, and is tilting it expertly towards his intake orifice. Such grace, such poise.&quot;

                              <span>Sam Altman has been fired as CEO of OpenAI, the company announced on Friday. Slashdot reader tagous submitted this statement from OpenAI&#x27;s board: Mr. Altman&#x27;s departure follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities. The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI. 
The Verge reports:
Chief technology officer Mira Murati will be the interim CEO, effective immediately. The company will be conducting a search for the permanent CEO successor. Employees at OpenAI found out about the news when it was announced publicly, according to multiple sources. This is an extremely sudden turn of events as Altman has largely been the face of OpenAI, which arguably kickstarted the current AI arms race with last year&#x27;s hugely popular ChatGPT. Just last week, Altman keynoted at the company&#x27;s DevDay conference, where it announced a suite of major new updates to compete with other big tech companies like Microsoft and Google. Altman also spoke at Thursday&#x27;s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference. &quot;I loved my time at OpenAI,&quot; Altman said in a post on X. &quot;It was transformative for me personally, and hopefully the world a little bit. Most of all I loved working with such talented people. Will have more to say about what&#x27;s next later.&quot;

                              <span>Google&#x27;s company-defining effort to catch up to ChatGPT creator OpenAI is turning out to be harder than expected. From a report: Google representatives earlier this year told some cloud customers and business partners they would get access to the company&#x27;s new conversational AI, a large language model known as Gemini, by November. But the company recently told them not to expect it until the first quarter of next year, according to two people with direct knowledge. The delay comes at a bad time for Google, whose cloud sales growth has slowed while that of its bigger rival, Microsoft, has accelerated. Part of Microsoft&#x27;s success has come from selling OpenAI&#x27;s technology to its customers.

                              <span>After months of wrangling, the European Commission says it has decided to renew the license for the weedkiller compound glyphosate, approving its use in European Union countries for ten more years. From a report: Following the decision yesterday, the Commission released a statement saying that, on the basis of comprehensive safety assessments carried out by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), it would renew the licence, &quot;subject to certain new conditions and restrictions.&quot; These include a ban on the use of the chemical to dry crops before harvest, and &quot;the need for certain measures to protect non-target organisms.&quot; Governments can still restrict the use of glyphosate in their own countries if they consider the risks too high, particularly in regard to the need to protect biodiversity, the statement added. 

Glyphosate is the active ingredient in Roundup, the world&#x27;s most widely used herbicide. Over the years, a debate has developed about whether the chemical is safe to use on food crops, as well as its possible environmental impacts. Some studies point to a link between glyphosate and certain cancers; others suggest that the way in which it is used should not harm consumers. Glyphosate has been investigated extensively by food- and chemicals-safety agencies, but disagreements among researchers remain. The license allowing glyphosate&#x27;s use in the EU was last renewed for five years in 2017. Ahead of the authorization&#x27;s expiry in last December, the European Union temporarily extended it for another year to allow the EFSA to assess some 2,400 studies about the compound and to make a recommendation to governments.

                              <span>Doctors have long relied on a few key patient characteristics to assess risk of a heart attack or stroke, using a calculus that considers blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking and diabetes status, as well as demographics: age, sex and race. Now, the American Heart Association is taking race out of the equation. From a report: The overhaul of the widely used cardiac-risk algorithm is an acknowledgment that, unlike sex or age, race identification in and of itself is not a biological risk factor. The scientists who modified the algorithm decided from the start that race itself did not belong in clinical tools used to guide medical decision making, even though race might serve as a proxy for certain social circumstances, genetic predispositions or environmental exposures that raise the risk of cardiovascular disease. 

The revision comes amid rising concern about health equity and racial bias within the U.S. health care system, and is part of a broader trend toward removing race from a variety of clinical algorithms. &quot;We should not be using race to inform whether someone gets a treatment or doesn&#x27;t get a treatment,&quot; said Dr. Sadiya Khan, a preventive cardiologist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, who chaired the statement writing committee for the American Heart Association, or A.H.A. The statement was published on Friday [PDF] in the association&#x27;s journal, Circulation. An online calculator using the new algorithm, called PREVENT, is still in development.

                              <span>Davide Castelvecchi, writing for Nature: A Nature retraction last week has put to rest the latest claim of room-temperature superconductivity -- in which researchers said they had made a material that could conduct electricity without producing waste heat and without refrigeration. The retraction follows the downfall of an even more brazen claim about a supposed superconductor called LK-99, which went viral on social media earlier this year. Despite these high-profile setbacks, superconductivity researchers say the field is enjoying somewhat of a renaissance. &quot;It&#x27;s not a dying field -- on the contrary,&quot; says Lilia Boeri, a physicist who specializes in computational predictions at the Sapienza University of Rome. The progress is fuelled in part by the new capabilities of computer simulations to predict the existence and properties of undiscovered materials. 

Much of the excitement is focused on &#x27;super-hydrides -- hydrogen-rich materials that have shown superconductivity at ever-higher temperatures, as long as they are kept at high pressure. The subject of the retracted Nature paper was purported to be such a material, made of hydrogen, lutetium and nitrogen. But work in the past few years has unearthed several families of materials that could have revolutionary properties. &quot;It really does look like we&#x27;re on the hairy edge of being able to find a lot of new superconductors,&quot; says Paul Canfield, a physicist at Iowa State University in Ames and Ames National Laboratory.

                              <span>The way we buy and sell homes in the U.S. isn&#x27;t normal -- at least not compared with the rest of the world. From a report: The commission on a home sale here is typically around 5% to 6%, usually split between the seller&#x27;s and buyer&#x27;s agents. In most countries, the commissions are substantially smaller. The U.S. is home to as many as three million agents. By most estimates, no other country is even a close second. 

Though it is unclear how much a court decision on commissions last month will upend American real estate, if at all, the ruling opens up the possibility of forever changing how agents are paid for their work. And looking at home sales around the world offers a window into what could be in store. One reason commissions here remain high is the use of buyer agents, said Ryan Tomasello, managing director at investment bank Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods. Home sellers pay the commission -- typically between 5% and 6% of a home&#x27;s selling price -- which is usually split between the seller&#x27;s and buyer&#x27;s agent. Buyer agents aren&#x27;t nearly as common in other parts of the world, said Tomasello. 

[...] In the pre-internet days, a buyer agent&#x27;s main job was to screen and filter listings for hopeful home buyers. Today, much of that early house hunting can be done online. So the role of the buyer agent has shifted more to providing advice and support, as well as recommendations for home inspectors, lenders and lawyers. A good buyer agent will know how to make a strong offer and may push to lower the home price. In most countries, buyer agents are much less of a factor.

                              <span>Canonical hosted an amusingly failure-filled demo of its new easy-to-install, Ubuntu-powered tool for building small-to-medium scale, on-premises high-availability clusters, Microcloud, at an event in London yesterday. From a report: The intro to the talk leaned heavily on Canonical&#x27;s looming 20th anniversary, and with good reason. Ubuntu has carved out a substantial slice of the Linux market for itself on the basis of being easier to use than most of its rivals, at no cost -- something that many Linux players still seem not to fully comprehend. The presentation was as buzzword-heavy as one might expect, and it&#x27;s also extensively based on Canonical&#x27;s in-house tech, such as the LXD containervisor, Snap packaging, and, optionally, the Ubuntu Core snap-based immutable distro. (The only missing buzzword didn&#x27;t crop up until the Q&amp;A session, and we were pleased by its absence: it&#x27;s not built on and doesn&#x27;t use Kubernetes, but you can run Kubernetes on it if you wish.) 

We&#x27;re certain this is going to turn off or alienate a lot of the more fundamentalist Penguinistas, but we are equally sure that Canonical won&#x27;t care. In the immortal words of Kevin Smith, it&#x27;s not for critics. Microcloud combines several existing bits of off-the-shelf FOSS tech in order to make it easy to link from three to 50 Ubuntu machines into an in-house, private high-availability cluster, with live migration and automatic failover. It uses its own LXD containervisor to manage nodes and workloads, Ceph for distributed storage, OpenZFS for local storage, and OVN to virtualize the cluster interconnect. All the tools are packaged as snaps. It supports both x86-64 and Arm64 nodes, including Raspberry Pi kit, and clusters can mix both architectures. The event included several demonstrations using an on-stage cluster of three ODROID machines with &quot;Intel N6005&quot; processors, so we reckon they were ODROID H3+ units -- which we suspect the company chose because of their dual Ethernet connections.

                              <span>The technology has become the standard LAN worldwide. From a report: Ethernet became commercially available in 1980 and quickly grew into the industry LAN standard. To provide computer companies with a framework for the technology, in June 1983 Ethernet was adopted as a standard by the IEEE 802 Local Area Network Standards Committee. Currently, the IEEE 802 family consists of 67 published standards, with 49 projects under development. The committee works with standards agencies worldwide to publish certain IEEE 802 standards as international guidelines. 

A plaque recognizing the technology is displayed outside the PARC facility. It reads: &quot;Ethernet wired LAN was invented at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in 1973, inspired by the ALOHAnet packet radio network and the ARPANET. In 1980 Xerox, DEC, and Intel published a specification for 10 Mbps Ethernet over coaxial cable that became the IEEE 802.3-1985 Standard. Later augmented for higher speeds, and twisted-pair, optical, and wireless media, Ethernet became ubiquitous in home, commercial, industrial, and academic settings worldwide.&quot;

From a report: &quot;As we continue to invent, we&#x27;re shifting some of our efforts to better align with our business priorities, and what we know matters most to customers -- which includes maximizing our resources and efforts focused on generative AI,&quot; wrote Daniel Rausch, vice president of Alexa and Fire TV, in the memo, obtained by GeekWire. &quot;These shifts are leading us to discontinue some initiatives, which is resulting in several hundred roles being eliminated.&quot;

                              <span>One of the world&#x27;s most active ransomware groups has taken an unusual -- if not unprecedented -- tactic to pressure one of its victims to pay up: reporting the victim to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. From a report: The pressure tactic came to light in a post published on Wednesday on the dark web site run by AlphV, a ransomware crime syndicate that&#x27;s been in operation for two years. After first claiming to have breached the network of the publicly traded digital lending company MeridianLink, AlphV officials posted a screenshot of a complaint it said it filed with the SEC through the agency&#x27;s website. Under a recently adopted rule that goes into effect next month, publicly traded companies must file an SEC disclosure within four days of learning of a security incident that had a &quot;material&quot; impact on their business. 

&quot;We want to bring to your attention a concerning issue regarding MeridianLink&#x27;s compliance with the recently adopted cybersecurity incident disclosure rules,&quot; AlphV officials wrote in the complaint. &quot;It has come to our attention that MeridianLink, in light of a significant breach compromising customer data and operational information, has failed to file the requisite disclosure under item 1.05 of form 8-K within the stipulated four business days, as mandated by the new SEC rules.&quot; The violation category selected in the online report was &quot;Material misstatement or omission in a company&#x27;s filings or financial statements or a failure to file.&quot;

I&#x27;m happy to say I now have an official answer: nope. RCS will use green bubbles just like SMS. [...] Apple has confirmed to me that blue bubbles will still be used to represent iMessages, while green bubbles will represent RCS messages. The company uses blue bubbles to denote what it believes is the best and most secure way for iPhone users to communicate, which is iMessage.

                              <span>Alibaba is canceling the scheduled IPO of its cloud division due to the impact of the U.S. government&#x27;s CPU export bans to China. The Register reports: The Chinese e-commerce giant reported the move alongside its calendar Q3 earnings, otherwise a generally positive quarter, with the group reporting an income from operations of $4.6 billion, up 34 percent year-on-year, and revenue of $30.8 billion, up 9 percent. Alibaba also said US export restrictions could affect its business more generally by making it harder for the company to upgrade its existing hardware. [...] It&#x27;s worth noting that the Cloud Intelligence Group brought in $3.789 billion in revenue but earnings before income tax and amortization was $193 million, up 44 percent on the same period a year earlier. Cloud sales growth has stalled in 2023 as customers weigh up their spending. 
&quot;We believe that these new restrictions [referring to expanded restrictions announced in October] may materially and adversely affect Cloud Intelligence Group&#x27;s ability to offer products and services and to perform under existing contracts, thereby negatively affecting our results of operations and financial condition,&quot; Alibaba said. &quot;We believe that a full spin-off of Cloud Intelligence Group may not achieve the intended effect of shareholder value enhancement,&quot; the company added. &quot;Accordingly, we have decided to not proceed with a full spin-off, and instead we will focus on developing a sustainable growth model for Cloud Intelligence Group (CIG) under the fluid circumstances.&quot;
 
&quot;The US needs to stop politicizing and weaponizing trade and tech issues and stop destabilizing global industrial and supply chains,&quot; Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said in response to the US&#x27;s new restrictions.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Prison phone company Global Tel*Link leaked the personal information of nearly 650,000 users and failed to notify most of the users that their personal data was exposed, the Federal Trade Commission said today. The company agreed to a settlement that requires it to change its security practices and offer free credit monitoring and identity protection to affected users, but the settlement doesn&#x27;t include a fine. &quot;Global Tel*Link and two of its subsidiaries failed to implement adequate security safeguards to protect personal information they collect from users of its services, which enabled bad actors to gain access to unencrypted personal information stored in the cloud and used for testing,&quot; the FTC said.

                              <span>Google has announced that its News app and news.google.com will remove support for paid magazines next month. &quot;The removal not only applies to new subscriptions/purchases, but also to existing libraries of magazines,&quot; reports 9to5Google. &quot;That means that users who have paid for magazines to use them in the Google News app will be cut off pretty soon.&quot; From the report: Ahead of the December 18 shutdown, users will be able to export copies of paid magazines. Magazines that cannot be exported due to interactive elements will be eligible for a refund. Google explains: &quot;Support for magazine content in Google News is being discontinued beginning on December 18, 2023, which means if you previously purchased or subscribed to magazines, access from Google News apps or news.google.com to your library of magazines will be removed. To continue to access previously purchased magazine content, we are providing the opportunity to export and save each purchased issue. In some cases, purchased magazines contain interactive elements that cannot be downloaded and saved for future access, and we are offering a refund for this content.&quot;
 
The company further adds that affected users will receive an email titled &quot;An update to Google News magazine support&quot; which will contain instructions on how to download copies of magazines they&#x27;ve paid for. However, the cutoff for downloads and/or refunds is also December 18, 2023, which means the clock is ticking. You can access your library of magazines on News here.

                              <span>Cambridge dictionary&#x27;s word of the year for 2023 is &quot;hallucinate,&quot; a verb that took on a new meaning with the rise in popularity of artificial intelligence chatbots. The Guardian reports: The original definition of the chosen word is to &quot;seem to see, hear, feel, or smell&quot; something that does not exist, usually because of &quot;a health condition or because you have taken a drug.&quot; It now has an additional meaning, relating to when artificial intelligence systems such as ChatGPT, which generates text that mimics human writing, &quot;hallucinates&quot; and produces false information. The word was chosen because the new meaning &quot;gets to the heart of why people are talking about AI,&quot; according to a post on the dictionary site.
 
Generative AI is a &quot;powerful&quot; but &quot;far from perfect&quot; tool, &quot;one we&#x27;re all still learning how to interact with safely and effectively -- this means being aware of both its potential strengths and its current weaknesses.&quot; The dictionary added a number of AI-related entries this year, including large language model (or LLM), generative AI (or GenAI), and GPT (an abbreviation of Generative Pre-trained Transformer). &quot;AI hallucinations remind us that humans still need to bring their critical thinking skills to the use of these tools,&quot; continued the post. &quot;Large language models are only as reliable as the information their algorithms learn from. Human expertise is arguably more important than ever, to create the authoritative and up-to-date information that LLMs can be trained on.&quot;

All of these Windows 11 changes are part of key tweaks that Microsoft has to make to its operating system to comply with the European Commission&#x27;s Digital Markets Act, which comes into effect in March 2024.

                              <span>samleecole writes: People who paid to speak to an AI girlfriend modeled after real life 23-year-old influencer Caryn Marjorie are distraught because the service they paid for, Forever Companions, no longer works. It appears that the service stopped working shortly after Forever Companion CEO and founder John Meyer was arrested for trying to set his own apartment on fire. 

404 Media tested CarynAI today as well as other AI bots and confirmed the service is not working. According to what we saw in the Telegram channel where Forever Companion users start conversations with CarynAI, the service has not been working since October 23. &quot;I terminated my relationship with Forever Voices due to unforeseen circumstances,&quot; Marjorie told 404 Media in an email. &quot;I wish the best for John Meyer and his family as he recovers from his mental health crisis. We didn&#x27;t see this coming but I vow to push CarynAI forward for my fans and supporters.&quot; On October 30, Marjorie also announced that she&#x27;s making a similar AI companion, &quot;CarynAI 2.0,&quot; with another company called Banter AI. On social media for the last few weeks, the official Forever Voices Twitter account has been posting bizarre videos and statements about the CIA, Donald Trump, and the FBI.

                              <span>Despite more than a decade of reminding, prodding, and downright nagging, a surprising number of developers still can&#x27;t bring themselves to keep their code free of credentials that provide the keys to their kingdoms to anyone who takes the time to look for them. From a report: The lapse stems from immature coding practices in which developers embed cryptographic keys, security tokens, passwords, and other forms of credentials directly into the source code they write. The credentials make it easy for the underlying program to access databases or cloud services necessary for it to work as intended. [...] 

The number of studies published since following the revelations underscored just how common the practice had been and remained in the years immediately following Uber&#x27;s cautionary tale. Sadly, the negligence continues even now. Researchers from security firm GitGuardian this week reported finding almost 4,000 unique secrets stashed inside a total of 450,000 projects submitted to PyPI, the official code repository for the Python programming language. Nearly 3,000 projects contained at least one unique secret. Many secrets were leaked more than once, bringing the total number of exposed secrets to almost 57,000.

                              <span>gaiageek writes: Of note, given the recent Slashdot article about Signal opening up to trying out usernames, is the $6 million annual cost of sending SMS messages for account verification, which certainly suggests that getting rid of phone number verification would be a significant cost-saving solution. Signal pays $14 million a year in infrastructure costs, for instance, including the price of servers, bandwidth, and storage. It uses about 20 petabytes per year of bandwidth, or 20 million gigabytes, to enable voice and video calling alone, which comes to $1.7 million a year. The biggest chunk of those infrastructure costs, fully $6 million annually, goes to telecom firms to pay for the SMS text messages Signal uses to send registration codes to verify new Signal accounts&#x27; phone numbers.

                              <span>9to5Mac: In a surprising move, Apple has announced today that it will adopt the RCS (Rich Communication Services) messaging standard. The feature will launch via a software update &quot;later next year&quot; and bring a wide range of iMessage-style features to messaging between iPhone and Android users. Apple&#x27;s decision comes amid pressure from regulators and competitors like Google and Samsung. It also comes as RCS has continued to develop and become a more mature platform than it once was. 

In a statement to 9to5Mac, an Apple spokesperson said that the company believes RCS will offer better interoperability for cross-platform messages. &quot;Later next year, we will be adding support for RCS Universal Profile, the standard as currently published by the GSM Association. We believe RCS Universal Profile will offer a better interoperability experience when compared to SMS or MMS. This will work alongside iMessage, which will continue to be the best and most secure messaging experience for Apple users.&quot;

                              <span>The UK has said it will refrain from regulating the British artificial intelligence sector, even as the EU, US and China push forward with new measures. From a report: The UK&#x27;s first minister for AI and intellectual property, Viscount Jonathan Camrose, said at a Financial Times conference on Thursday that there would be no UK law on AI &quot;in the short term&quot; because the government was concerned that heavy-handed regulation could curb industry growth. The announcement comes as executives and policymakers around the world debate how to regulate the emerging technology, which holds the promise of transforming many industries and driven the rise in large tech company valuations over the past year. 

The EU has led the field, with its legislation on AI regulation expected to come into force before the end of this year. Beijing is also implementing measures to regulate the industry, while US President Joe Biden recently issued an executive order to promote &quot;responsible innovation.&quot; Camrose added: &quot;I would never criticise any other nation&#x27;s act on this. But there is always a risk of premature regulation.&quot; In rushing to introduce industry controls, &quot;you are not actually making anybody as safe as it sounds,&quot; he said. &quot;You are stifling innovation, and innovation is a very very important part of the AI equation.&quot;

                              <span>Samsung has admitted that hackers accessed the personal data of U.K.-based customers during a year-long breach of its systems. From a report: In a statement to TechCrunch, Samsung spokesperson Chelsea Simpson, representing the company via a third-party agency, said Samsung was &quot;recently alerted to a security incident&quot; that &quot;resulted in certain contact information of some Samsung U.K. e-store customers being unlawfully obtained.&quot; Samsung declined to answer further questions about the incident, such as how many customers were affected or how hackers accessed its internal systems. 

In a letter sent to affected customers, Samsung admitted that attackers exploited a vulnerability in an unnamed third-party business application to access the personal information of customers who made purchases at Samsung U.K.&#x27;s store between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020. The letter, which was shared on X (formerly Twitter), Samsung said it didn&#x27;t discover the compromise until more than three years later, on November 13, 2023. Samsung told affected customers that hackers may have accessed their names, phone numbers, postal addresses, and email addresses.

                              <span>Britain&#x27;s drugs regulator has approved a groundbreaking treatment for two painful and debilitating lifelong blood disorders, which works by &quot;editing&quot; the gene that causes them. From a report: The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has given the green light for Casgevy to be used to treat sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. It is the first medicine licensed anywhere that works by deploying gene editing that uses the &quot;genetic scissors,&quot; known as CRISPR, for which its inventors won the Nobel prize for chemistry. 

Casgevy&#x27;s developers hope the pioneering treatment could banish the pain, infections and anaemia sickle cell disease brings and the severe anaemia experienced by those with beta thalassemia. About 15,000 people in the UK, almost all of African or Caribbean heritage, have sickle cell disease. About 1,000 -- mainly of Mediterranean, south Asian, south-east Asian and Middle Eastern background -- have beta thalassemia and need regular blood transfusions to treat their anaemia. Experts in the illnesses hope Casgevy may be a cure, making it no longer necessary for people with the conditions to have a bone marrow transplant. Until now this has been the only treatment available, even though the body can reject the donor marrow. The Sickle Cell Society welcomed the MHRA&#x27;s decision as a &quot;historic moment for the sickle cell community&quot; which &quot;offers [them] newfound hope and optimism.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: In May this year, Alexis Hancock&#x27;s daughter got a children&#x27;s tablet for her birthday. Being a security researcher, Hancock was immediately worried. &quot;I looked at it kind of sideways because I&#x27;ve never heard of Dragon Touch,&quot; Hancock told TechCrunch, referring to the tablet&#x27;s maker. As it turned out, Hancock, who works at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, had good reasons to be concerned. Hancock said she found that the tablet had a slew of security and privacy issues that could have put her daughter&#x27;s and other children&#x27;s data at risk. 

The Dragon Touch KidzPad Y88X contains traces of a well-known malware, runs a version of Android that was released five years ago, comes pre-loaded with other software that&#x27;s considered malware and a &quot;potentially unwanted program&quot; because of &quot;its history and extensive system level permissions to download whatever application it wants,&quot; and includes an outdated version of an app store designed specifically for kids, according to Hancock&#x27;s report, which was released on Thursday and seen by TechCrunch ahead of its publication. Hancock said she reached out to Dragon Touch to report these issues, but the company never responded. Dragon Touch did not respond to TechCrunch&#x27;s questions either. After TechCrunch reached out to the company, Walmart removed the listing from its website, while Amazon said it&#x27;s looking into the matter.

                              <span>Amazon is the driving force behind a trio of advocacy groups working to thwart Microsoft&#x27;s growing ambition to become a major cloud computing contractor for governments, a Bloomberg analysis shows. From the report: The groups -- the Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE), the Coalition for Fair Software Licensing and the Alliance for Digital Innovation -- want to convince policymakers that Microsoft has improperly locked customers into Azure, its cloud computing service, choking off its rivals and hindering the advancement of technology within the government and beyond. These groups have dozens of members. But Amazon is the biggest funder for two of them and the largest company, measured by revenue, that funds another. 

Spokespeople for the groups say no single company determines their agendas. But according to a Bloomberg News review of tax filings, documents and interviews with people familiar with the three groups&#x27; operations, Amazon Web Services plays a direct role in shaping their efforts in ways that would boost the cloud giant. Through aggressive lobbying of policymakers, these groups want to ensure that customers can use popular Microsoft products like Office Suite or Windows on any cloud computing system -- and, in particular, on Amazon Web Services, the world&#x27;s number one cloud infrastructure provider and the retail giant&#x27;s top profit driver. 

To hammer that message, they&#x27;ve filed complaints, lobbied regulators and sought to shape the views of policymakers probing the cloud market. In one case, an Amazon executive is listed as the author of a public comment to the Federal Trade Commission, as well as testimony and letters to Congress on behalf of the group, according to an analysis of the documents&#x27; metadata, revealing the tech giant&#x27;s role in the lobbying campaign. (The group says the documents reflect the consensus position of its members.) Amazon denied it authored statements for the group.

                              <span>Airbnb has acquired a secretive new AI startup, GamePlanner.AI, for around $200 million. TechCrunch reports: GamePlanner was co-founded by Adam Cheyer and Siamak Hodjat. Cheyer famously helped co-launch the startup Siri, which Apple acquired and whose technology became the basis for Apple&#x27;s AI-powered Siri assistant. Hodjat previously worked with Cheyer at Viv Labs, a firm that Samsung bought and leveraged to launch its own AI assistant, Bixby, in 2017. It&#x27;s not immediately clear what GamePlanner does. A LinkedIn search only turns up two associates: Gabe Greenbaum, a general partner at B Capital who sits on GamePlanner&#x27;s board of directors, and Joseph Huang, head of design at GamePlanner. GamePlanner hasn&#x27;t had a web presence for some time; the Internet Archive&#x27;s earliest cache of the website (from December 2021) yields a blank page.
 
But in a canned statement, Airbnb CEO and co-founder Brian Chesky hinted that the 12-person startup combines expertise in AI and design toward crafting AI-driven experiences, sort of like an AI-focused consultancy. &quot;AI will rapidly alter our world more than any other technology in our lifetime, but we need to ensure that it augments humanity in a positive way,&quot; Chesky said, adding that the GamePlanner team will focus on &quot;accelerating&quot; select AI projects and integrating their tooling into Airbnb&#x27;s platform. &quot;Airbnb is one of the more humanistic companies in technology, and I believe that, together with Adam and his team, we can develop some of the best interfaces and practical applications for AI.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Engadget: A group of lawmakers from a House of Representatives committee wants Apple, like many Jon Stewart enthusiasts, to explain why its streaming arm abruptly canceled the talk show The Problem With Jon Stewart. The current affairs TV series hosted by Jon Stewart briefly made its debut on Apple TV+ in 2021 but its time on air ended when the show received the ax for a third season, reportedly due to &quot;disagreements&quot; over show topics.
 
According to Reuters, Lawmakers want to know if the show&#x27;s coverage and criticism of China has anything to do with the show&#x27;s cancellation. The government officials have asked Apple to speak on the issue by Dec 15, 2023. In a letter to the tech giant, the House members wrote that while Apple has the right to determine what content it deems appropriate for its platform, &quot;the coercive tactics of a foreign power should not be directly or indirectly influencing these determinations.&quot; This effort is bipartisan, with members from both Republican and Democratic parties affiliated with the House of Representatives&#x27; Select Committee on Competition with the Chinese Communist Party.

                              <span>Once a product category proves popular, it&#x27;s common for more companies to enter the market. Eventually, many options appear that are essentially mostly the same. Now we&#x27;ve got something that quacks like a commodity.
Once we&#x27;ve got a commodity, generics eventually follow. Devoid of fancy packaging, marketing, and advertising, prices fall while quality remains perfectly acceptable.
Brand name products might be slightly better on some dimensions, but it ultimately becomes a value judgement. A few bucks difference? The confidence of buying a brand name still feels worth it. Many, many bucks different? Maybe not.
This happens in most industries. Maybe not in airplanes, but absolutely in peanut butter. And you know what&#x27;s closer to peanut butter than airplanes? Software is.
Strangely, many software categories have commoditized, but, given that nearly everything is a service these days, operational costs have remained universally high. This makes it hard for lower priced generics to creep in. This means people continue to pay luxury prices for software services that are essentially commodities. We think something&#x27;s wrong with that. Sounds like an opportunity.
This is where ONCE comes in.
One facet of our initial strategy with ONCE is to find those commoditized pay-forever services everyone&#x27;s running, and make our own radically simplified &quot;80/20&quot; versions as pay-once products. And this time you get to own for less, not rent for more. And you&#x27;ll get the code, too.
In about a month we&#x27;ll unveil the first ONCE product. Any guesses?

                              <span>Michael Larabel reports via Phoronix: Guardrails have been in place where the Firefox browser has enabled Wayland by default (when running on recent GTK versions) but as of today that code has been removed... Firefox will try to move forward with stable releases where Wayland will ship by default! Mozilla Bug 1752398 to &quot;ship the Wayland backend to release&quot; has been closed this evening! After the ticket was open for the past two years, it&#x27;s now deemed ready to hopefully ship enabled for Firefox 121!
 
This patch drops the &quot;early beta or earlier&quot; check to let Wayland support be enabled by default when running on recent GTK versions (GTK 3.24.30 threshold). Firefox 121 is due for release around 19 December and if all continues to hold, it will finally ship with the Wayland back-end enabled by default as another big step forward.

                              <span>In what may be a potentially confusing rebranding move, Microsoft today has rebranded Bing Chat to Copilot, sharing the same brand name as multiple other Microsoft AI products. Search Engine Land reports: Bing is no longer &quot;your AI-powered copilot for the web.&quot; However, Microsoft Bing will still provide a combined Search and chat experience. It will just be called CoPilot heading forward. For people who may not want that combined experience, CoPilot will have its own standalone ChatGPT-style experience at https://copilot.microsoft.com/.
 
Microsoft said the rebrand is to unify the Copilot experience: &quot;Our efforts to simplify the user experience and make Copilot more accessible to everyone starts with Bing, our leading experience for the web. Beginning today, Bing Chat and Bing Chat Enterprise are becoming Copilot, with commercial data protection enforced when any eligible user is signed in with Microsoft Entra ID.&quot;
 
While it&#x27;s definitely a more unified experience, it also seems a bit confusing because Microsoft&#x27;s chatbot &quot;companion&quot; is used across multiple apps, including Microsoft 365, Edge, Windows and more -- some free, some not. In addition to Bing Chat, Bing Chat Enterprise is also rebranded as Copilot Pro. It offers the same chat functionality with greater commercial data protection for Microsoft 365 subscribers.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: If you&#x27;ve only ever used standard Qi chargers with devices that don&#x27;t have their own schemes, the Wireless Power Consortium&#x27;s announcement today of the first Qi 2.0 devices being ready to launch before the holidays, with more than 100 in the queue behind them, is great. Qi2 sports a &quot;Magnetic Power Profile&quot; (MPP), created with help by Apple&#x27;s MagSafe team, to help align devices and chargers&#x27; coils for faster, more efficient charging. Qi2-certified devices set onto Qi2 chargers can achieve 15 W charging, up from 7.5 W in the standard Qi scheme.
 
That brings Qi2 devices up to the same speed as iPhones on MagSafe chargers, and it clears up some consumer confusion about how fast a device might charge on Qi, MagSafe, or proprietary charger…</span>

                              <span>Nasa&#x27;s James Webb space telescope has revealed a planet where specks of sand fall as rain, in groundbreaking observations. From a report: The planet, Wasp-107b, lies 200 light years away in the Virgo constellation and had already caught the attention of astronomers because it is very large but very light, earning it the nickname the &quot;candy floss&quot; planet. The latest observations give an unprecedented glimpse of a strange and exotic world beyond our solar system that features silicate sand clouds and rain, scorching temperatures, raging winds and the distinct burnt-matches scent of sulphur dioxide. &quot;Our knowledge of other planets is based on what we know from Earth,&quot; said Prof Leen Decin, of the Catholic Institute (KU) Leuven and first author of the research. &quot;That&#x27;s a very restricted knowledge.&quot; 

The planet was discovered in 2017 after astronomers spotted a telltale periodic flickering of light from its host star each time the planet passed in front of it. &quot;It&#x27;s like a fly in front of a street lamp,&quot; said Decin. &quot;You see a slight dimming of the light.&quot; James Webb takes these observations to the next level by measuring starlight that is filtered through the planet&#x27;s atmosphere. Because different elements absorb different wavelengths of light, the spectrum of starlight indicates which gases are present. Wasp-107b is similar in mass to Neptune but almost the size of Jupiter, and its vast, diffuse nature allows the James Webb telescope to peer deep into its atmosphere.

                              <span>Amazon said on Wednesday that it was removing seven eyedrops products from its website after the Food and Drug Administration warned the company that the eyedrops had not been recognized as safe and effective. From a report: The F.D.A. said in a letter to Andrew Jassy, Amazon&#x27;s chief executive, on Monday that Amazon had violated federal regulations by selling the eyedrops, which claimed to help with problems including pink eye, dry eyes, eyestrain and floaters. &quot;These products are especially concerning from a public health perspective,&quot; the F.D.A. letter said. &quot;Ophthalmic drug products, which are intended for administration into the eyes, in general pose a greater risk of harm to users because the route of administration for these products bypasses some of the body&#x27;s natural defenses.&quot; 

The eyedrops named in the letter are: Similasan Pink Eye Relief, The Goodbye Company Pink Eye, Can-C Eye Drops, Optique 1 Eye Drops, OcluMed Eye Drops, TRP Natural Eyes Floaters Relief, and Manzanilla Sophia Chamomile Herbal Eye Drops. None of the eyedrops appeared to be available for purchase on Amazon on Wednesday morning. The company said in an emailed statement on Wednesday that &quot;safety is a top priority.&quot;

                              <span>Microsoft and Nvidia want to help developers run and configure AI models on their Windows PCs. During the Microsoft Ignite event on Wednesday, Microsoft announced Windows AI Studio: a new hub where developers can access AI models and tweak them to suit their needs. From a report: Windows AI Studio allows developers to access development tools and models from the existing Azure AI Studio and other services like Hugging Face. It also offers an end-to-end &quot;guided workspace setup&quot; with model configuration UI and walkthroughs to fine-tune various small language models (SLMs), such as Microsoft&#x27;s Phi, Meta&#x27;s Llama 2, and Mistral. 

Windows AI Studio lets developers test the performance of their models using Prompt Flow and Gradio templates as well. Microsoft says it&#x27;s going to roll out Windows AI Studio as a Visual Studio Code extension in the &quot;coming weeks.&quot; Nvidia, similarly, revealed updates to TensorRT-LLM, which the company initially launched for Windows as a way to run large language models (LLMs) more efficiently on H100 GPUs. However, this latest update brings TensorRT-LLM to PCs powered by GeForce RTX 30 and 40 Series GPUs with 8GB of RAM or more.

                              <span>Tencent dismissed concerns that US export controls will constrain its AI development capabilities, at least for the foreseeable future. From a report: The Shenzhen-based company has stockpiled Nvidia&#x27;s H800 artificial intelligence accelerators, enough to develop its proprietary Hunyuan AI model for at least another couple of generations, President Martin Lau said on an analyst call after earnings on Wednesday. &quot;Right now we actually have one of the largest inventories of AI chips in China among all the players,&quot; Lau said. &quot;We were the first to put in orders for H800 and that allows us to have a pretty good inventory of H800 chips. So we have enough chips to continue our development.&quot; 

The Biden administration in October escalated export controls on AI semiconductors heading to China, depriving the Asian nation from access to a broad range of the world&#x27;s best AI-training hardware. The purpose of the measures is to prevent China&#x27;s military from obtaining the advanced technology, Washington argues, but they&#x27;re also making business harder for the country&#x27;s private sector. Elsewhere in China, AI industry veteran Kai-Fu Lee&#x27;s unicorn startup 01.AI has been buying up the Nvidia chips it needs to develop its own foundation models, with Lee saying the company has enough semiconductors for the next 18 months.

                              <span>Microsoft is officially launching its Notion-like productivity and collaboration app called Loop. From a report: Loop lets you use flexible, collaborative workspaces and pages to make it easier to cooperate on work. If you&#x27;re familiar with Notion&#x27;s interface at all, Loop looks and feels remarkably similar -- right down to the ability to easily access a bunch of tools and formatting options by typing the forward slash key (which pulls up what Microsoft calls the &quot;insert menu&quot;). But because Loop is built by Microsoft, that means it has some useful integrations with other Microsoft software.

                              <span>The EU has struck a deal that will force the fossil fuel industry to rein in dangerous methane pollution. From a report: Under the proposed law, which is the first of its kind, coal, oil and gas companies would be required to report their methane emissions and take steps to avoid them. The measures include finding and fixing leaks, and limiting wasteful practices such as venting and flaring gas by 2027. Jutta Paulus, a German MEP with the Green grouping who worked on the proposal, said: &quot;Finally, the EU tackles the second most important greenhouse gas with ambitious measures. Less methane emissions mean more climate protection and more energy sovereignty.&quot; 

Methane has more than 80 times the global heating power of carbon dioxide over a 20-year timespan but does not last as long in the atmosphere. Cutting methane emissions is seen as a cheap and easy way to stop extreme weather growing more violent in the short-term. The new EU rules, which were agreed on Wednesday by the European parliament and European Council, mean fossil fuel companies must try to repair leaks no more than five days after finding them, and fully fix them within a month. By the end of next year, operators will have to survey their existing sites and submit action plans to find and fix methane leaks.

                              <span>Microsoft unveiled its first homegrown AI chip and cloud-computing processor in an attempt to take more control of its technology and ramp up its offerings in the increasingly competitive market for AI computing. The company also announced new software that lets clients design their own AI assistants. From a report: The Maia 100 chip, announced at the company&#x27;s annual Ignite conference in Seattle on Wednesday, will provide Microsoft Azure cloud customers with a new way run AI programs that generate content. Microsoft is already testing the chip with its Bing and Office AI products, said Rani Borkar, a vice president who oversees Azure&#x27;s chip unit. Microsoft&#x27;s main AI partner, ChatGPT maker OpenAI, is also testing the processor. Both Maia and the server chip, Cobalt, will debut in some Microsoft data centers early next year. 

Microsoft&#x27;s multi-year investment shows how critical chips have become to gaining an edge in both AI and the cloud. Making them in-house lets companies wring performance and price benefits from the hardware. The initiative also could insulate Microsoft from becoming overly dependent on any one supplier, a vulnerability currently underscored by the industrywide scramble for Nvidia&#x27;s AI chips. Microsoft&#x27;s push into processors follows similar moves by cloud rivals. Amazon.com Inc. acquired a chip maker in 2015 and sells services built on several kinds of cloud and AI chips. Google began letting customers use its AI accelerator processors in 2018.

                              <span>Ever wanted to add your own annotations to search results you find on Google? With Google&#x27;s new &quot;Notes&quot; experiment, launching Wednesday as an opt-in feature through Search Labs, you&#x27;ll be able to. From a report: If you&#x27;ve opted in to Notes, buttons to add and see notes will appear under search results and under articles on Discover in the Google app. When you create a note, you can add colorful fonts and images. During a briefing, Google showed me a note for an article about different kinds of frosting that had green text, an image of a cake, and a heart sticker. (At the bottom of the note, there was a link to the article the note was about.) 

If you post a note, it should show up &quot;within minutes,&quot; unless it&#x27;s flagged for human review, Google VP Cathy Edwards said in an interview with The Verge. When you look at all of the notes for a link, what&#x27;s shown will be ranked dynamically based on things like the user&#x27;s query and a note&#x27;s relevance to the content on the page.

                              <span>Huawei and China Mobile have built a 3,000 kilometer (1,860-mile) internet network linking Beijing to the south, which the country is touting as its latest technological breakthrough. From a report: The two firms teamed up with Tsinghua University and research provider Cernet.com to build what they claim is the world&#x27;s first internet network to achieve a &quot;stable and reliable&quot; bandwidth of 1.2 terabits per second, several times faster than typical speeds around the world. Trials began July 31 and it&#x27;s since passed various tests verifying that milestone, the university said in a statement. 

Tsinghua, Chinese President Xi Jinping&#x27;s alma mater, is plugging the project as an industry-first built entirely on homegrown technology, and credits Huawei prominently in its statement. The Chinese firm in August made waves when it released a 5G smartphone with a sophisticated made-in-China processor, inspiring celebration in Chinese state and social media. That event also spurred debate in Washington about whether the Biden administration has gone far enough in attempts to contain Chinese technological achievement.

From the report: The move marks a phasing out of Fitbit products after the Big Tech company acquired wearable company in 2021. Last month, Fitbit said it would remove itself from Asian markets Hong Kong, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines, along with European markets Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Romania, and Slovakia. It&#x27;s possible Google is removing Fitbit and Nest from the European markets because they don&#x27;t have a Google Store support. If that changes, Fitbit products and Nest Aware subscriptions could return. New products like the Pixel Watch could also arrive for the first time. &quot;We remain committed to our customers and have not made any changes that impact the existing Fitbit devices they already own. Existing Fitbit customers will continue to have access to the same customer support, warranties will still be honored, and products will continue to receive software and security updates,&quot; the Google spokesperson said.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Intel on Tuesday pushed microcode updates to fix a high-severity CPU bug that has the potential to be maliciously exploited against cloud-based hosts. The flaw, affecting virtually all modern Intel CPUs, causes them to &quot;enter a glitch state where the normal rules don&#x27;t apply,&quot; Tavis Ormandy, one of several security researchers inside Google who discovered the bug, reported. Once triggered, the glitch state results in unexpected and potentially serious behavior, most notably system crashes that occur even when untrusted code is executed within a guest account of a virtual machine, which, under most cloud security models, is assumed to be safe from such faults. Escalation of privileges is also a possibility.

                              <span>A few months ago, by accepting RFC 3355, the decision was made to start working on an official specification for the Rust language. Eric (maintainer of the Rust Reference), Felix (Rust language team), Joel (Rust Foundation) and Mara (author of the RFC) have been working together to get this effort started.
With this blog post, we present the steps we have taken so far and our plans for approaching the rest of this big task.
Editor
One of the first steps was to fill the role of &quot;editor&quot; as laid out in the RFC. The responsibility of coordination and editing of the specification is purposely delegated to the Rust Foundation, to ensure continuity of the work.
As part of the hiring effort for this role by the Foundation, we interviewed a few interested candidates with relevant experience. Becau…</span>

The company says that, although it already has policies that prohibit manipulated media, AI necessitated the creation of new policies because of its potential to mislead viewers if they don&#x27;t know the video has been &quot;altered or synthetically created.&quot; One of the changes that will roll out involves the creation of new disclosure requirements for YouTube creators. Now, they&#x27;ll have to disclose when they&#x27;ve created altered or synthetic content that appears realistic, including videos made with AI tools. For instance, this disc…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Electrek: On Monday, Rivian released an incremental software update 2023.42, which bricked the infotainment system in R1Ses and R1Ts. The company is frantically working on a fix, but it might not be an OTA. [...] The vehicles are drivable, but software and displays go black. It appears that the 2023.42 software update hangs at 90% on the vehicle screen or 50% on the app screen, and then the vehicle screens black out. All systems appear to still work except for the displays. At the moment, it appears that Amazon vans are not impacted. Update: The company has acknowledged the issue with affected customers but has yet to issue a fix or plan to fix. Rivian&#x27;s vice president of software engineering, Wassim Bensaid, took to Reddit to update users on the situation, writing: &quot;Hi All, We made an error with the 2023.42 OTA update -- a fat finger where the wrong build with the wrong security certificates was sent out. We cancelled the campaign and we will restart it with the proper software that went through the different campaigns of beta testing. Service will be contacting impacted customers and will go through the resolution options. That may require physical repair in some cases. This is on us -- we messed up. Thanks for your support and your patience as we go through this.
 
*Update 1 (11/13, 10:45 PM PT): The issue impacts the infotainment system. In most cases, the rest of the vehicle systems are still operational. A vehicle reset or sleep cycle will not solve the issue. We are validating the best options to address the issue for the impacted vehicles. Our customer support team is prioritizing support for our customers related to this issue. Thank you.&quot;

                              <span>India&#x27;s capital, New Delhi, is preparing a new weapon in the fight against deadly air pollution: cloud seeding. From a report: The experiment, which could take place as early as next week, would introduce chemicals like silver iodide into a cloudy sky to create rain and, it&#x27;s hoped, wash away the fine particulate matter hovering over one of the world&#x27;s largest cities. The need is desperate. Delhi has already tried traffic restriction measures, multimillion-dollar air filtration towers, and the use of fleets of water-spraying trucks to dissolve the particulate matter in the air -- but to no avail. 

The use of cloud seeding, if it goes ahead, would be controversial. &quot;It&#x27;s not at all a good use of resources because it&#x27;s not a solution, it&#x27;s like a temporary relief,&quot; says Avikal Somvanshi, a …</span>

                              <span>Some of the United States&#x27; largest civil liberties groups are urging Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer not to pursue a short-term extension of the Section 702 surveillance program slated to sunset on December 31. From a report: The more than 20 groups -- Demand Progress, the Brennan Center for Justice, American Civil Liberties Union, and Asian Americans Advancing Justice among them -- oppose plans that would allow the program to continue temporarily by amending &quot;must-pass&quot; legislation, such as the bill needed now to avert a government shutdown by Friday, or the National Defense Authorization Act, annual legislation set to dictate $886 billion in national security spending across the Pentagon and US Department of Energy in 2024. 

&quot;In its current form, [Section 702] is dangerous to our liberties and our democracy, and it should not be renewed for any length of time without robust debate, an opportunity for amendment, and -- ultimately -- far-reaching reforms,&quot; a letter from the groups to Schumer says. It adds that any attempt to prolong the program by rushed amendment &quot;would demonstrate blatant disregard for the civil liberties and civil rights of the American people.&quot;

                              <span>The Top500 organization released its semi-annual list of the fastest supercomputers in the world, with the AMD-powered Frontier supercomputer retaining its spot at the top of the list with 1.194 Exaflop/s (EFlop/s) of performance, fending off a half-scale 585.34 Petaflop/s (PFlop/s) submission from the Argonne National Laboratory&#x27;s Intel-powered Aurora supercomputer. From a report: Argonne&#x27;s submission, which only employs half of the Aurora system, lands at the second spot on the Top500, unseating Japan&#x27;s Fugaku as the second-fastest supercomputer in the world. Intel also made inroads with 20 new supercomputers based on its Sapphire Rapids CPUs entering the list, but AMD&#x27;s EPYC continues to take over the Top500 as it now powers 140 systems on the list -- a 39% year-over-year increase. 

Intel and Argonne are currently still working to bring Arora fully online for users in 2024. As such, the Aurora submission represented 10,624 Intel CPUs and 31,874 Intel GPUs working in concert to deliver 585.34 PFlop/s at a total of 24.69 megawatts (MW) of energy. In contrast, AMD&#x27;s Frontier holds the performance title at 1.194 EFlop/s, which is more than twice the performance of Aurora, while consuming a comparably miserly 22.70 MW of energy (yes, that&#x27;s less power for the full Frontier supercomputer than half of the Aurora system). Aurora did not land on the Green500, a list of the most power-efficient supercomputers, with this submission, but Frontier continues to hold eighth place on that list. However, Aurora is expected to eventually reach up to 2 EFlop/s of performance when it comes fully online. When complete, Auroroa will have 21,248 Xeon Max CPUs and 63,744 Max Series &#x27;Ponte Vecchio&#x27; GPUs spread across 166 racks and 10,624 compute blades, making it the largest known single deployment of GPUs in the world. The system leverages HPE Cray EX â&quot; Intel Exascale Compute Blades and uses HPE&#x27;s Slingshot-11 networking interconnect.

                              <span>After a tech entrepreneur and investor lost his password for retrieving $100,000 in bitcoin and hired experts to break open the wallet where he kept it, they failed to help him. But in the process, they discovered a way to crack enough other software wallets to steal $1 billion or more. From a report: On Tuesday, the team is releasing information about how they did it. They hope it&#x27;s enough data that the owners of millions of wallets will realize they are at risk and move their money, but not so much data that criminals can figure out how to pull off what would be one of the largest heists of all time. 

Their start-up, Unciphered, has worked for months to alert more than a million people that their wallets are at risk. Millions more haven&#x27;t been told, often because their wallets were created at cryptocurrency websites that have gone out of business. The story of those wallets&#x27; vulnerabilities underscores the enormous risk in experimental currencies, beyond their wild fluctuations in value and fast-changing regulations. Many wallets were created with code containing profound flaws, and the companies that used that code can disappear. Beyond that, it is a sobering reminder that underneath software infrastructure of all kinds, even ones explicitly dedicated to securing funds, are open-source programs that few or no people oversee. &quot;Open-source ages like milk. It will eventually go bad,&quot; said Chris Wysopal, a co-founder of security company Veracode who advised Unciphered as it sorted through the problem.

                              <span>In research published in Science today, Google DeepMind&#x27;s model, GraphCast, was able to predict weather conditions up to 10 days in advance, more accurately and much faster than the current gold standard. From a report: GraphCast outperformed the model from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in more than 90% of over 1,300 test areas. And on predictions for Earth&#x27;s troposphere -- the lowest part of the atmosphere, where most weather happens -- GraphCast outperformed the ECMWF&#x27;s model on more than 99% of weather variables, such as rain and air temperature. Crucially, GraphCast can also offer meteorologists accurate warnings, much earlier than standard models, of conditions such as extreme temperatures and the paths of cyclones. In September, GraphCast accurately predicted that Hurricane Lee would make landfall in Nova Scotia nine days in advance, says Remi Lam, a staff research scientist at Google DeepMind. Traditional weather forecasting models pinpointed the hurricane to Nova Scotia only six days in advance. 

[...] Traditionally, meteorologists use massive computer simulations to make weather predictions. They are very energy intensive and time consuming to run, because the simulations take into account many physics-based equations and different weather variables such as temperature, precipitation, pressure, wind, humidity, and cloudiness, one by one. GraphCast uses machine learning to do these calculations in under a minute. Instead of using the physics-based equations, it bases its predictions on four decades of historical weather data. GraphCast uses graph neural networks, which map Earth&#x27;s surface into more than a million grid points. At each grid point, the model predicts the temperature, wind speed and direction, and mean sea-level pressure, as well as other conditions like humidity. The neural network is then able to find patterns and draw conclusions about what will happen next for each of these data points.

                              <span>Nothing Phone 2 owners get blue bubbles now. The company shared it has added iMessage to its newest phone through a new &quot;Nothing Chats&quot; app powered by the messaging platform Sunbird. From a report: The feature will be available to users in North America, the EU, and other European countries starting this Friday, November 17th. Nothing writes on its page that it&#x27;s doing this because &quot;messaging services are dividing phone users,&quot; and it wants &quot;to break those barriers down.&quot; But doing so here requires you to trust Sunbird. Nothing&#x27;s FAQ says Sunbird&#x27;s &quot;architecture provides a system to deliver a message from one user to another without ever storing it at any point in its journey,&quot; and that messages aren&#x27;t stored on its servers. 

Marques Brownlee has also had a preview of Nothing Chats. He confirmed with Nothing that, similar to how other iMessage-to-Android bridge services have worked before, &quot;...it&#x27;s literally signing in on some Mac Mini in a server farm somewhere, and that Mac Mini will then do all of the routing for you to make this happen.&quot; Nothing&#x27;s US head of PR, Jane Nho, told The Verge in an email that Sunbird stores user iCloud credentials as a token &quot;in an encrypted database&quot; and associated with one of its Mac Minis in the US or Europe, depending on the user&#x27;s location, that then act as a relay for iMessages sent via the app. She added that, after two weeks of inactivity, Sunbird deletes the account information.

                              <span>An anonymous reader writes: Videos collected by 404 Media over months give a peek into the world of spoofing numbers, automated call scripts, and a specific seller of the phones. From the report: &quot;Alright lads,&quot; a man sitting in the passenger seat of a moving car says in a heavy British accent. In his left hand he holds a special phone he is showing off to his clients, while with the other he films his demonstration which was later uploaded to Telegram. &quot;I&#x27;m only going to say it once, yeah. You swipe, and it&#x27;s gone,&quot; he continues, demonstrating one app installed that can instantly destroy data stored on the device. The phone in question is one from &quot;Russiancoms,&quot; an underground outfit that sells the devices for just under $2,000 each. For that price, customers get a laundry list of features: the ability to spoof phone numbers, play hold music, and have a computerized voice read pre-determined scripts. While Russiancoms does not acknowledge in its Telegram channel what the phones might really be for, those are features well suited to committing fraud. 

The Russiancoms Telegram channel periodically deletes its videos and other messages, but 404 Media has been archiving many of them for months. They provide insight into a little known industry of fraud phones, ones that make it easy for anyone to enter the world of robocalling or other scams. While much of the underground phone industry has been focused on providing secure communications to criminals -- companies like Phantom Secure, Encrochat, and Sky for example -- Russiancoms and similar companies appear to cater to a different use case: enabling people to make calls that fraudulently appear to come from someone else. A common tool in the underground is also so-called Russian SIMs, which can spoof numbers in some cases. Russiancoms&#x27; phones, however, are more fully featured.

                              <span>The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has struggled to stop a hyper-aggressive cybercrime gang that&#x27;s been tormenting corporate America over the last two years, according to nine cybersecurity responders, digital crime experts and victims. Reuters: For more than six months, the FBI has known the identities of at least a dozen members tied to the hacking group responsible for the devastating September break-ins at casino operators MGM Resorts International and Caesars Entertainment, according to four people familiar with the investigation. Industry executives have told Reuters they were baffled by an apparent lack of arrests despite many of the hackers being based in America. &quot;I would love for somebody to explain it to me,&quot; said Michael Sentonas, president of CrowdStrike, one of the firms leading the response effort to the hacks. 

&quot;For such a small group, they are absolutely causing havoc,&quot; Sentonas told Reuters in an interview last month. Sentonas said the hackers were &quot;known&quot; but didn&#x27;t provide specifics. He did say, &quot;I think there is a failure here.&quot; Asked who was responsible for the failure, Sentonas said, &quot;law enforcement.&quot; [...] Dubbed by some security professionals as &quot;Scattered Spider,&quot; the hacking group has been active since 2021 but it grabbed headlines following a series of intrusions at several high profile American companies.

                              <span>AI could be used to predict if a person is at risk of having a heart attack up to 10 years in the future, a study has found. From a report: The technology could save thousands of lives while improving treatment for almost half of patients, researchers at the University of Oxford said. The study, funded by the British Heart Foundation (BHF), looked at how AI might improve the accuracy of cardiac CT scans, which are used to detect blockages or narrowing in the arteries. 

Prof Charalambos Antoniades, chair of cardiovascular medicine at the BHF and director of the acute multidisciplinary imaging and interventional centre at Oxford, said: &quot;Our study found that some patients presenting in hospital with chest pain -- who are often reassured and sent back home -- are at high risk of having a heart attack in the next decade, even in the absence of any sign of disease in their heart arteries. Here we demonstrated that providing an accurate picture of risk to clinicians can alter, and potentially improve, the course of treatment for many heart patients.&quot; 

About 350,000 people in the UK have a CT scan each year but, according to the BHF, many patients later die of heart attacks due to their failure in picking up small, undetectable narrowings. Researchers analysed the data of more than 40,000 patients undergoing routine cardiac CT scans at eight UK hospitals, with a median follow-up time of 2.7 years. The AI tool was tested on a further 3,393 patients over almost eight years and was able to accurately predict the risk of a heart attack. AI-generated risk scores were then presented to medics for 744 patients, with 45% having their treatment plans altered by medics as a result.

Google says the men weaponized copyright law&#x27;s notice-and-takedown system to sabotage competitors&#x27; trade, while damaging the search engine&#x27;s business and those of its customers.

                              <span>Hello again from the Rust Leadership Council!
We wanted to share an update on what the Council has been working on since our last update.
Accomplishments so far
We have elected new project directors!
Through the great work of the Project Director Election Process Committee,
we have defined a process for selecting Project Directors for the Rust Foundation Board of Directors.
We carried out the process, and recently announced the new directors.
We will be following up with a retrospective to identify what went well and what can be improved,
and feed those improvements back into the process for next year.
We have established a new home for Project governance documentation at https://forge.rust-lang.org/governance/index.html.
As changes to the governance policies are accepted via the RFC proce…</span>

                              <span>I can&#x27;t thank Honeypot and Carolina Cabral enough for the producing The Rails Documentary that was just released today. Looking back on those early, formative years of Ruby on Rails with Tobi, Jamis, Jeremy, and Jason was actually kind of profound. I usually don&#x27;t spend much time looking back, so for once to stop and marvel at how we got started twenty years ago was really special. A fitting tribute to two decades of working with Ruby on the web.
Together with 37signals, Rails has been my life&#x27;s work. I&#x27;ve had the pleasure to collaborate with literally thousands of people on evolving the framework, and I&#x27;ve been humbled to see well over a million applications be built with it. Everything from tiny internal apps to $77 billion behemoths like Shopify.
Now one of the reasons I don&#x27;t spend too…</span>

                              <span>The Rust compiler&#x27;s front-end can now use parallel execution to significantly
reduce compile times. To try it, run the nightly compiler with the -Z threads&#x3D;8 option. This feature is currently experimental, and we aim to ship
it in the stable compiler in 2024.
Keep reading to learn why a parallel front-end is needed and how it works, or
just skip ahead to the How to use it
section.
Compile times and parallelism
Rust compile times are a perennial concern. The Compiler Performance Working
Group
has continually improved compiler performance for several years. For example,
in the first 10 months of 2023, there were mean reductions in compile time of
13%,
in peak memory use of
15%,
and in binary size of
7%,
as measured by our performance suite.
However, at this point the compiler has been heavil…</span>

Here’s the 16th installment of my popular Heard Something, Read Something, Saw Something series.
So, what do we have this time...
Heard Something
Lately I&#x27;ve been enjoying listening to discussions about free will. Do we have it? If so, how much? Always? Sometimes? Never? Is it real or an illusion? I find the concept fascinating. One of my favorite recent conversations (debates?) about the topic was between Russ Roberts and Robert Sapolsky on Robert&#x27;s EconTalk podcast. Listen in. 
Hear it: https://www.econtalk.org/robert-sapolsky-on-determinism-free-will-and-responsibility/
Read Something
Every once in a while you read something that swirls with someone’s body of work and undeniably signals they definitively know what the fuck they’re doing. This is that, by Jonathan Hoefler.
Read it: https://typography.com/blog/text-for-proofing-fonts
Saw Something
Driving Dreams is a wonderful documentary on the golden age of Italian automotive design. Full of colorful characters, poetic stories, and the celebration of an art form — and approach — that&#x27;s now long gone. Well worth the 52 minutes.
See it: https://www.amazon.com/Driving-Dreams-Gianluca-Migliarotti/dp/B07455DCH7/
Until next time.

                              <span>As React UI controls become more sophisticated, complex logic can get
     intertwined with the visual representation. This makes it hard to reason
     about the behavior of the component, hard to test it, and necessary to
     build similar components that need a different look. Juntao
     Qiu tackles this by using a Headless Component, which
     extracts all non-visual logic and state management, separating the brain of
     a component from its looks.

From Lamborghini to Pagani, Porsche to Ferrari, Aston Martin to Bentley, I have owned and loved them all. A+ use of lottery money, would do it again!
It&#x27;s against all these delightful automotive experiences that I&#x27;ve been shocked at how utterly compelling the Tesla Model S Plaid has revealed itself to be. And in just a month&#x27;s worth of ownership.
This is a car that now retails for $86,090 in the US. About the same as an Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio or a BMW M3 with a couple of options. Expensive, premium cars, but far from the realm of the brands mentioned above. And yet, somehow, it&#x27;s proven itself to be as special and as exotic a…</span>

All on the premise that we&#x27;d work towards becoming profitable, remaining in the country, and avoiding the VC timebomb. The one that has already fulfilled all the objectives is Workfeed, and now they&#x27;re ready to take on the American market. It&#x27;s a proud moment!
Workfeed makes employee scheduling software. That might sound pretty boring, but if you run or work at a restaurant (or store or anywhere else in the service industry!) still trying to do things with Excel spreadsheets or call sheets, you know this can be a huge pain and time suck. That&#x27;s exactly the kind of drudgery that software was meant to solve, and Workfeed does an amazing job at this.

                              <span>The most counterintuitive of the Stoic mental exercises is that of negative visualization. Willfully imagining all manner of terrible things that might befall you, but haven&#x27;t yet. Described like this, it sorta sounds like a fancy word of anxiety, but if you look closer, it&#x27;s in fact its opposite.
The point of visualizing the consequences of an accident, the loss of a loved one, or the bankruptcy of your business is not to stew in despair, but to prepare yourself for the inevitability of hardship. Nobody makes it through life entirely on easy mode, and if you haven&#x27;t done any manner of mental preparation, even small setbacks can seem calamitous. So you really ought to prepare.
In this way, negative visualization is like the dojo in The Matrix. It&#x27;s a way to level up your skills inside a si…</span>

Not only has the site stayed up, despite hysteric proclamations that it would crater soon after his personnel changes, but X has been able to increase the pace of experimentation and feature introductions at the same time. It&#x27;s been impressive to watch, regardless of what you think of the politics involved.
Now I understand that for many it&#x27;s indeed impossible to leave those politics aside. And however you&#x27;re aligned, you&#x27;ll find a chart to support your position that X is either thriving or has one foot in the grave. So let&#x27;s not even get into that.

We want to improve the reliability and performance of crate downloads.
&quot;Non-canonical downloads&quot; (that use URLs containing hyphens or underscores where the crate published uses the opposite) are blocking these plans.
On 2023-11-20 support for &quot;non-canonical downloads&quot; will be disabled.
cargo users are unaffected.
What are &quot;non-canonical downloads&quot;?
The &quot;non-canonical downloads&quot; feature allows everyone to download the serde_derive crate from https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/serde_derive/1.0.189/download, but also from https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/SERDE-derive/1.0.189/download, where the underscore was replaced with a hyphen (crates.io normalizes underscores and hyphens to be the same for uniqueness purposes, so it isn&#x27;t possible to publish a crate named serde-derive because serde_de…</span>
