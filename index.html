                              <span>Amazon.com has introduced a generative AI service that it claims will &quot;dramatically improve the listing creation and management experience for sellers.&quot; The company says the AI &quot;will simplify how Amazon sellers create more thorough and captivating product descriptions&quot; and &quot;enrich existing listings, helping customers more confidently make purchase decisions.&quot; The Register reports: Using an unspecified large language model, Amazon will allow sellers to enter &quot;a brief description of the product in a few words or sentences&quot; and then &quot;generate high-quality content for their review.&quot; Sellers can review the AI output, or just &quot;directly submit the automatically generated content to the Amazon catalog.&quot; Amazon reckons the results will offer customers &quot;more complete, consistent, and engaging product information that will enhance their shopping experiences.&quot;
 
Authors who post their works to the e-tail elephant&#x27;s Kindle bookstore also need to consider AI as last week the content guidelines for e-book authors and publishers added a requirement to disclose machine-generated content &quot;when you publish a new book or make edits to and republish an existing book.&quot; Amazon wants to be told of any AI-generated images, texts, or translations. Altering the work of an AI does not exempt authors and publishers from this requirement, as Amazon&#x27;s definition of &quot;AI-generated&quot; includes material generated by a machine that received &quot;substantial edits&quot; by a human. AI-assisted content -- defined as material created by a human and then offered to a machine for edits, refinements, error-checks or other improvements -- doesn&#x27;t have to be disclosed.

                              <span>Global cryptocurrency exchange CoinEX announced that someone hacked its hot wallets and stole large amounts of digital assets that were used to support the platform&#x27;s operations. BleepingComputer reports: The incident occurred on September 12 and preliminary results of the investigation show that the unauthorized transactions involved Ethereum ($ETH), Tron ($TRON), and Polygon ($MATIC) cryptocurrency. CoinEx has not provided any info about the financial impact incurred, as the investigation has yet to determine the complete losses.
 
However, a report from blockchain security firm PeckShield says that the attack drained CoinEx of about $19 million in $ETH, $11 million in $TRON, $6.4 million in Smart Chain Coin ($BSC), $6 million in Bitcoin (BTC), and approximately $295,000 in (MATIC). According to PeckShield, the loss from this attack amounts to about $43 million, while the remaining $72 million kept on the same stash has been transferred to better-protected cold wallets.
 
A more recent estimation on the CoinEx losses coming from CertiK Alert raises the figure to $53 million, analyzed as seen in this document. User assets have not been impacted by the incident, CoinEx said, and assuring that any parties suffering loss will receive full compensation. At the time of writing, all deposit and withdrawal services on CoinEx have been suspended to protect user assets and will only resume after the exchange&#x27;s IT team makes sure that all risk has been eliminated.

The company pioneered the use of huge presses with 6,000 to 9,000 tons of clamping pressure to mold the front and rear structures of its Model Y in a &quot;gigacasting&quot; process that slashed production costs and left rivals scrambling to catch up. In a bid to extend its lead, Tesla is closing in on an innovation that would allow it to die cast nearly all the complex underbody of an EV in one piece, rather than about 400 parts in a conventional car, the people said.

The Register reports: On Tuesday, GitHub responded to the hostile feedback by stating that some of the questioned behavior was actually due to bugs that have now been fixed, even as it doubled down on its decision to combine the previously separate &quot;Following&quot; and &quot;For You&quot; feeds. The &quot;Following&quot; feed included &quot;activity by people you follow and from repositories you watch.&quot; It was the result of deliberate user choice: developers selected the code and contributors they were interested in.

They&#x27;re also the first smartphones to support the open-source smart home protocol Thread. The Verge&#x27;s Jennifer Pattison Tuohy explains how Apple might deploy this wireless connectivity protocol in its ecosystem: The obvious use for Thread in the iPhone is as a Thread border router for the slew of new Apple Home and Matter-enabled Thread smart home devices from companies like Eve, Nanoleaf, and Belkin WeMo.

However, there seemed to be no immediate prospect of an EU-wide ban as the European Commission said it would wait for feedback from other EU countries before deciding on any action. European Union member states, which were notified by the French regulator on Wednesday, have three months to provide comments. Some, such as Italy, said they would take no steps for now.

                              <span>GoDaddy needs to cut more jobs, reduce the tech budget, and address why it is falling short of financial targets outlined at its shareholder day in 2022, or the board should consider exploring a sale of the business. From a report: This is the view from activist investor Starboard Blue LLP, GoDaddy&#x27;s third largest shareholder and one which is agitating for change and a seat on the corporation&#x27;s board, something it has so far failed to secure. An open letter [PDF] to GoDaddy&#x27;s top brass starts off friendly enough, with Starboard Value managing member Peter Feld describing the business as a &quot;one-stop shop for micro- and small-businesses looking to develop a web presence.&quot; 

Feld says Starboard Value invested in the stock, a move it made public in early 2022, on the basis of opportunities for strong revenue growth, &quot;meaningful margin expansion&quot; and a &quot;more appropriate capital allocation strategy.&quot; &quot;Unfortunately, despite each of these opportunities remaining, over the last 18 months we have been disappointed by GoDaddy&#x27;s operational, financial and stock price performance,&quot; the letter adds. At the investor day, GoDaddy projected compound annual growth in revenue of 10 percent between 2022 and 2024, as well as 15 percent EBITDA, 20 percent free cashflow per share and $3 billion in share buybacks.

                              <span>A luxury cruise ship that had been stuck for three days after running aground off the coast of Greenland was pulled free on Thursday morning, the authorities said. From a report: The ship, the Ocean Explorer, had been carrying 206 passenger and crew members and was headed toward Alpefjord, in a remote corner of Greenland. The ship&#x27;s destination was the Northeast Greenland National Park, the world&#x27;s northernmost national park, which is home to icebergs, glaciers and high mountains. The Joint Arctic Command, which is part of Denmark&#x27;s defense forces, and SunStone Maritime Group, the coordinators of the rescue operation, said in statements on Thursday that the ship had been pulled free by a vessel named Tarajoq. 

There were no reported injuries on board the ship, and there was no threat to the environment. The ship&#x27;s operator, Aurora Expeditions, a cruise company based in Australia, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The rescue came after an unsuccessful attempt on Wednesday, in which a fishing research vessel owned by the government of Greenland tried and failed to pull free the Ocean Explorer at high tide. Bad weather also slowed the government&#x27;s rescue operations, officials said. Before the ship was freed, the Joint Arctic Command had said that &quot;the crew and passengers are in a difficult situation, but after the circumstances, the atmosphere on the ship is good and everyone on board is fine.&quot;

                              <span>California, the home to many of tech&#x27;s biggest companies and the nation&#x27;s most populous state, is pushing ahead with a right-to-repair bill for consumer electronics and appliances. From a report: After unanimous votes in the state Assembly and Senate, the bill passed yesterday is expected to move through a concurrence vote and be signed by Governor Gavin Newsom. &quot;Since Right to Repair can pass here, expect it to be on its way to a backyard near you,&quot; said iFixit CEO Kyle Wiens in a statement. iFixit, a seller of repair parts and tools and advocate for right-to-repair laws, based in San Luis Obispo, California, was joined in its support for the California repair law by another California company with a history of opposing repair laws: Apple. The consumer tech giant&#x27;s letter urging passage of the bill was surprising, to say the least, though Apple said that the bill&#x27;s stipulations for &quot;individual users&#x27; safety&quot; and &quot;product manufacturers&#x27; intellectual property&quot; were satisfactory. 

California&#x27;s bill goes further than right-to-repair laws in other states. Rather than limiting its demand that companies provide parts, tools, repair manuals, and necessary software for devices that are still actively sold, California requires that vendors provide those items for products sold after July 1, 2021, starting in July 2024. Products costing $50 to $99.99 must be accompanied by those items for three years, and items $100 and more necessitate seven years. The bill also provides for stronger enforcement mechanisms, allowing for municipalities to bring superior court cases rather than contact the state attorney general.

From the report: Unity, the maker of tools and technology for video games, set off a firestorm on Sept. 12 by announcing it will begin charging developers a new fee for games made using its software, called the Unity Engine. Beginning Jan. 1, makers of Unity games will have to pay per user installation after a certain threshold is reached. Some video-game makers accused Unity of violating its own terms of service and lamented that the new charges could threaten their livelihoods. Many game studios put out harshly worded statements urging the technology company to reconsider.

                              <span>Google is working to push back the expiration date of Chromebooks, addressing concerns held by school administrators that the laptops are too short-lived to be cost effective. From a report: The Alphabet-owned company -- which develops the Chrome operating system running on computers made mostly by others -- said Thursday it plans to provide software updates for Chromebooks for up to a decade. The new policy, which starts next year, ensures that no existing Chromebook will expire within the next two years. The disclosure of this policy change comes after an August column in The Wall Street Journal detailing schools&#x27; struggles with expiring Chromebooks. Chromebooks are ubiquitous in classrooms around the country, but some education software doesn&#x27;t work after what Google calls the Auto Update Expiration date. Unsupported Chromebooks can&#x27;t be used for mandatory state testing, even if the hardware still appears functional. 

When the laptops expire, school districts recycle them, sometimes at a cost, and spend millions of dollars on replacements. Google currently sets expiration dates based on the release date of specific models. Newer models have eight years of support, while older Chromebooks have five. Starting in 2024, Google will support a given laptop &quot;platform&quot; -- a certain combination of hardware components -- for 10 years after the first device in the platform hits store shelves. These so-called platforms aren&#x27;t unique to specific brands or manufacturers and can be found in a variety of distinct models.

                              <span>HP is the latest company to announce a foldable-screen PC. From a report: The 17-inch Spectre Foldable PC has a keyboard that can be used wirelessly with the device propped up on its kickstand. Or you could magnetically attach the keyboard to the screen&#x27;s bottom half or even slide the keyboard toward you for a 1.5-screen-like experience. The OLED device addresses concerns around battery life and portability by including two battery packs instead of one. But the bendy, Intel 12th-gen computer will have to do quite a lot to even begin rationalizing its staggering $5,000 price. The Spectre Fold works as a 17-inch, 0.33-inch (8.5 mm) thick OLED tablet. Uniquely, it has an integrated kickstand for propping the PC up at a 120-degree angle. This is key because HP cites the kickstand as one of the reasons the computer is so costly, but this also means you don&#x27;t have to deal with separate origami stands/sleeves. 

With the PC propped up, it should be easy to work with the included wireless keyboard or stylus, which both charge wirelessly on the device. The Bluetooth keyboard can attach to the bottom half of the PC&#x27;s screen for a 12.3-inch laptop view. If you slide the keyboard down toward you, revealing more of the OLED, the PC will automatically display windows north of the keyboard. This scenario is like working on a 14-inch laptop. HP says it worked with Microsoft to customize Windows 11&#x27;s Snap feature so it&#x27;s easy to bring a window or two to the space above the docked keyboard. Lenovo&#x27;s Yoga Book 9i, a clamshell laptop with a second OLED screen where you&#x27;d expect the keyboard and touchpad to be, also lets you place windows on top of a docked keyboard. But when I tested that laptop, I typically found looking down physically uncomfortable.

                              <span>The Justice Department will press its argument Thursday that Google sought to strike agreements with mobile carriers to win powerful default positions on smartphones to dominate search in an antitrust trial that could change the future of the internet. From a report: The government will wrap up questioning Thursday of Antonio Rangel, who teaches behavioral biology at the California Institute of Technology. Other witnesses will be James Kolotouros, for Google, and Brian Higgins, from Verizon Communications. The government says the Alphabet unit paid $10 billion annually to wireless companies like AT&amp;T, device makers like Apple and browser makers like Mozilla to fend off rivals and keep its search engine market share near 90%. The government has also alleged that Google illegally took steps to protect communications about the payments. 

The government called witnesses on Tuesday and Wednesday to show that Google, as far back as the mid-2000s, sought to attract a large number of search queries by winning default status on mobile devices. Another witness, Rangel, discussed how powerful default status was, although data he used to show this was largely redacted. Google&#x27;s clout in search, the government alleges, has helped Google build monopolies in some aspects of online search advertising. Search is free so Google makes money through advertising.

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s attempt at avoiding deeper European Union scrutiny of its Teams video-conferencing app fell flat with the bloc&#x27;s antitrust enforcers readying a formal complaint against the firm&#x27;s conduct. From a report: Microsoft&#x27;s recent proposal to split its Teams from a broader business software package and sell it to customers separately with an annual discount wasn&#x27;t enough to satisfy regulators&#x27; concerns, according to people familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The European Commission is preparing a statement of objections to send to the company, which could come in the next few months, the people said. At the end of August, Microsoft attempted to allay concerns raised by the EU&#x27;s antitrust arm as part of a new investigation into how it ties Teams to its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 packages. The EU&#x27;s investigation followed a complaint from Salesforce&#x27;s messaging platform Slack some three years ago.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Engadget: The ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware group claimed responsibility for the MGM Resorts cyber outage on Tuesday, according to a post by malware archive vx-underground. The group claims to have used common social engineering tactics, or gaining trust from employees to get inside information, to try and get a ransom out of MGM Resorts, but the company reportedly refuses to pay. The conversation that granted initial access took just 10 minutes, according to the group.
 
&quot;All ALPHV ransomware group did to compromise MGM Resorts was hop on LinkedIn, find an employee, then call the Help Desk,&quot; the organization wrote in a post on X. Those details came from ALPHV, but have not been independently confirmed by security researchers. The international resort chain started experiencing outages earlier this week, as customers noticed slot machines at casinos owned by MGM Resorts shut down on the Las Vegas strip. As of Wednesday morning, MGM Resorts still shows signs that it&#x27;s experiencing downtime, like continued website disruptions. In a statement on Tuesday, MGM Resorts said: &quot;Our resorts, including dining, entertainment and gaming are currently operational.&quot; However, the company said Wednesday that the cyber incident has significantly disrupted properties across the United States and represents a material risk to the company.
 
&quot;[T]he major credit rating agency Moody&#x27;s warned that the cyberattack could negatively affect MGM&#x27;s credit rating, saying the attack highlighted &#x27;key risks&#x27; within the company,&quot; reports CNBC. &quot;The company&#x27;s corporate email, restaurant reservation and hotel booking systems remain offline as a result of the attack, as do digital room keys. MGM on Wednesday filed a 8-K report with the Securities and Exchange Commission noting that on Tuesday the company issued a press release &#x27;regarding a cybersecurity issue involving the Company.&#x27;&quot; MGM&#x27;s share price has declined more than 6% since Monday.

                              <span>&quot;AFRINIC, the regional internet registry for the African continent and Indian Ocean region, has been placed under receivership following an injunction obtained against it in the Supreme Court of Mauritius,&quot; writes Slashdot reader Kelerei. &quot;This appears to be a result of poor governance at AFRINIC, and in part a consequence of an IP address assignment debacle in 2021.&quot; MyBroadband reports: Industry players on both sides of a conflict involving the registry have welcomed the Mauritian Supreme Court&#x27;s latest ruling, as it potentially creates a path to reconstitute the ailing entity&#x27;s board and appoint a CEO. Headquartered in Mauritius, AFRINIC found itself on the wrong side of the country&#x27;s corporate governance laws after repeatedly ignoring warnings from its members and community about the danger. It also disregarded judgments on some occasions, with the courts warning AFRINIC that it was in danger of being held in contempt. The blow that finally left Afrinic without a quorate board and ultimately without a CEO was struck by Crystal Web, a defunct Internet Service Provider that used to offer consumer DSL and fiber broadband in South Africa. Although Crystal Web landed the paralyzing hit, it was hardly the primary litigant in the over 55 court cases brought against AFRINIC since June 2020.

                              <span>Visual effects workers at Marvel Studios have unanimously voted to unionize with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, marking a historic milestone for the industry. Rolling Stone reports: Following the successful vote with the NLRB, Marvel&#x27;s VFX union will now enter into collective bargaining negotiations with Marvel. A start date for those negotiations hasn&#x27;t been announced yet. Underpinning the union drive were the poor working conditions visual effects professionals have endured on Marvel productions, including a lack of pay equity, grueling hours, understaffing, excessive requests for changes, and unfair turnaround times.
 
VFX crews have been a crucial part of film and TV productions since the introduction of visual effects in the first Star Wars films of the 1970s. But while many other backstage/behind-the-scenes crews and professions (such as production designers, editors, lighting, make-up, and props) have long been unionized under the IATSE umbrella, VFX workers largely remained non-union.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from the Associated Press: As young children went back to school across Sweden last month, many of their teachers were putting a new emphasis on printed books, quiet reading time and handwriting practice and devoting less time to tablets, independent online research and keyboarding skills. The return to more traditional ways of learning is a response to politicians and experts questioning whether the country&#x27;s hyper-digitalized approach to education, including the introduction of tablets in nursery schools, had led to a decline in basic skills. Swedish Minister for Schools Lotta Edholm, who took office 11 months ago as part of a new center-right coalition government, was one of the biggest critics of the all-out embrace of technology. &quot;Sweden&#x27;s students …</span>

                              <span>The Justice Department sought on Wednesday to show how Google did all it could to get people to use its search engine and build itself into a $1 trillion search and advertising giant on the second day of a once-in-a-generation antitrust trial. From a report: First out of the gate, the government questioned a former Google executive, Chris Barton, about billion-dollar deals with mobile carriers and others that helped make Google the default search engine. Barton, who was at Google from 2004 to 2011, said the number of Google executives working to win default status with mobile carriers grew dramatically when he was with the company, recognizing the potential growth of handheld devices and early versions of smartphones.

From a report: The first 20 prototype IVAS 1.2 goggles were delivered in late July and assessed by two squads of solders in late August to check for improvements in reliability, low-light performance and how well they fit without repeats of the nausea and dizziness that halted the deployment of earlier versions. The devices, based on Microsoft&#x27;s HoloLens &quot;mixed reality&quot; goggles, &quot;demonstrated improvements in reliability, low light sensor performance, and form factor&quot; in tests last month at Fort Drum, New York, and &quot;soldier feedback was positive,&quot; spokesman David Patterson said in an email.

WSJ: Musk, the CEO of Tesla and owner of X (formerly Twitter), warned about what he views as AI&#x27;s potential to threaten humanity, according to a participant. Microsoft founder Gates said the technology could help address world hunger, said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), who convened the session. Other speakers included Facebook founder Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Google, Microsoft, Nvidia and IBM, along with union leaders.

                              <span>The White House, weighing in for the first time on concerns about a Chinese backlash against Apple, said it is monitoring reports of a growing government ban of iPhones and believes the move is a reprisal against the US. From a report: &quot;It seems to be of a piece of the kinds of aggressive and inappropriate retaliation to US companies that we&#x27;ve seen from the PRC in the past,&quot; said John Kirby, the council&#x27;s spokesman, referring to the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Bloomberg News reported this month that China plans to expand a ban on the use of iPhones to a plethora of state-backed companies and agencies, a sign of growing challenges for Apple in the country. Several Chinese agencies have begun instructing staff not to bring their iPhones to work. 

But the situation grew more muddled Wednesday, when Beijing pushed back on reports about iPhone restrictions while also raising concerns about security problems with the device. &quot;China has not issued laws and regulations to ban the purchase of Apple or foreign brands&#x27; phones,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular press briefing in Beijing on Wednesday. It marked the government&#x27;s first comments on the issue, but didn&#x27;t seem to refer directly to workplace bans of the device.

                              <span>A journalist and researcher on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), or UFOs as they&#x27;re better known, presented the remains of purported &quot;non-human&quot; beings to lawmakers in Mexico on Tuesday during the country&#x27;s first public congressional hearing on the topic. From a report: Jamie Maussan brought two boxes containing what he said were the small, stuffed bodies of extraterrestrials recovered in Peru in 2017. He said carbon-14 dating carried out by the National Autonomous University of Mexico had determined the remains were 700 and 1,800 years old. Each of the figures has only three fingers on each hand and elongated heads, resembling, at least superficially, the Hollywood-born character ET. 

&quot;This is the first time it (extraterrestrial life) is presented in such a form and I think there is a clear demonstration that we are dealing with non-human specimens that are not related to any other species in our world,&quot; Maussan told the lawmakers, urging them to consider the topic, which he said should not be viewed as &quot;a political topic -- it&#x27;s a topic for humanity.&quot; He said DNA evidence could prove the specimens were not of this planet, but it wasn&#x27;t clear if any such tests had been carried out. At least one previous claim by Maussan about purported &quot;non-human&quot; remains discovered in Peru has been debunked, though the specimens he presented Tuesday in Mexico City appeared different to the one he previously spoke about in 2015.

From a report: The daylong, high-profile gathering, featuring Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Sam Altman and other tech figures, has its share of skeptics in both parties. Some senators lamented that the so-called AI Insight Forum is closed to the public and the media. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said it would allow tech billionaires to lobby senators behind closed doors about one of the most critical issues facing the country and economy. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who organized the bipartisan gathering along with Sens. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., Todd Young, R-Ind., and Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., dismissed the criticism, noting that three public hearings on AI have been held and that the forums will also include labor and civil rights leaders, national security experts and academics.

From a report: Criminal networks have for several years been using money from drug deals, robberies, fraud and contract killings to pay for false Spotify streams of songs published by artists with ties to the gangs, an investigative report in Svenska Dagbladet claimed. They then get paid by the platform for the high number of streams, thereby laundering the money. The newspaper said its information had been confirmed by four gang members from separate criminal networks in Stockholm, as well as an anonymous police investigator.

                              <span>AmiMoJo writes: France has ordered Apple to stop selling the iPhone 12 for emitting too much electromagnetic radiation. On Tuesday, the French watchdog which governs radio frequencies also told the tech giant to fix existing phones. The ANFR has advised Apple that if it cannot resolve the issue via a software update, it must recall every iPhone 12 ever sold in the country. France&#x27;s digital minister Jean-Noel Barrot told French newspaper Le Parisien the decision was due to radiation levels above the acceptable threshold, according to Reuters. He said the ANFR found the iPhone 12&#x27;s Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) was above what is legally allowed. &quot;Apple is expected to respond within two weeks,&quot; he said. &quot;If they fail to do so, I am prepared to order a recall of all iPhones 12 in circulation. The rule is the same for everyone, including the digital giants.&quot;

                              <span>Sony is rolling out a big new PS5 update today, just over a month after it first started testing the changes in a beta. From a report: The update adds Dolby Atmos, lets you mute that annoying bootup beep, and even supports pairing a second controller as an assist one to let you help friends or family complete a game. Sony is also expanding its PS Remote Play app to Google&#x27;s Chromecast with Google TV (4K), allowing you to stream games from a PS5 or PS4 to Android TV OS 12 devices. The Dolby Atmos support comes in the form of Sony&#x27;s 3D Audio implementation (Tempest 3D AudioTech). It&#x27;s compatible with Dolby Atmos devices like sound bars, TVs, or home theater systems. Media apps like Netflix can also update their apps on PS5 soon to support Dolby Atmos audio. 

You can now mute the PS5 beep sound that chirps when you turn the console on or off, or even when it goes into rest mode after being idle. If you just want to adjust the volume of the beep there&#x27;s now an option for that, too. One of the most useful additions is the ability to use a second DualSense controller for assistance. &quot;You can now assign a second controller to one account as an assist controller, and use two controllers to operate your PS5 console as if you were using a single controller,&quot; explains Hideaki Nishino, senior vice president of platform experience at Sony Interactive Entertainment. &quot;This feature introduces a new way for you to enjoy games collaboratively with others or help a friend or child navigate a particularly challenging section of a game.&quot;

                              <span>Mozilla has released emergency security updates to fix a critical zero-day vulnerability exploited in the wild, impacting its Firefox web browser and Thunderbird email client. From a report: Tracked as CVE-2023-4863, the security flaw is caused by a heap buffer overflow in the WebP code library (libwebp), whose impact spans from crashes to arbitrary code execution. &quot;Opening a malicious WebP image could lead to a heap buffer overflow in the content process. We are aware of this issue being exploited in other products in the wild,&quot; Mozilla said in an advisory published on Tuesday. Mozilla addressed the exploited zero-day in Firefox 117.0.1, Firefox ESR 115.2.1, Firefox ESR 102.15.1, Thunderbird 102.15.1, and Thunderbird 115.2.2. Even though specific details regarding the WebP flaw&#x27;s exploitation in attacks remain undisclosed, this critical vulnerability is being abused in real-world scenarios.

                              <span>The ring/silent switch has been on the iPhone since the very first one was announced in 2007 by Steve Jobs, but now the writing is on the wall for the device&#x27;s last significant moving part. From a report: With its replacement by a haptic &quot;action button,&quot; it&#x27;s just a matter of time before the rest of the lineup is as smooth as a pebble from the river. At today&#x27;s iPhone event, the no doubt long-contemplated change was announced with little fanfare, selling the new button as a customizable shortcut to anything the user wants. Launch the camera, or an assistance feature, or a particular app, etc. Seems useful in some ways, especially for accessibility. But I mourn the loss of this switch the way I do every time they compromise the hardware design of Apple devices. Removing TouchID is one such choice I still hold out hope they will reverse. The haptic touchpads in MacBooks is not something I enjoy compared to the actual depression of the originals, though it&#x27;s probably a net benefit repair-wise. The attempt to unify under a single port was unsuccessful in everything but driving dongle sales. They have tried and failed to kill the magnetic power connector.

                              <span>The cofounder and main promoter of the $4 billion OneCoin pyramid scheme was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in one of the first and biggest criminal frauds involving cryptocurrency. Bloomberg: Karl Sebastian Greenwood, 46, was sentenced in New York Tuesday, after pleading guilty in December to creating and promoting a phony cryptocurrency. Greenwood was the wingman of Ruja Ignatova, the so-called &quot;Cryptoqueen&quot; and most wanted crypto fugitive in the world. US District Judge Edgardo Ramos called the fraud &quot;massive in many respects,&quot; noting that OneCoin had no blockchain, no real cryptocoin and no trading market. Victims could not withdraw their investments and most face the likelihood they&#x27;ll never get any of their money back. &quot;At base, it involved nothing more than old-fashioned snake oil,&quot; the judge said. Greenwoood&#x27;s sentencing closes one chapter of the OneCoin case, which authorities describe as one of the largest pyramid schemes in history. It impacted 3.5 million victims across the globe and foreshadowed a broader crackdown on crime in the cryptocurrency markets.

                              <span>Companies choose Alphabet&#x27;s Google as the default search engine for their browsers and smartphones because it is the best one, and not because of a lack of competition, a Google lawyer said Tuesday at the start of a high-stakes antitrust trial in Washington. From a report: Consumers use Google &quot;because it delivers value to them, not because they have to,&quot; John Schmidtlein, a partner at Williams &amp; Connolly LLP who is representing the company, said during his opening statements on the first day of the trial. &quot;Users today have more search options and ways to access information online than ever before.&quot; 

Schmidtlein pushed back on claims by US Justice Department antitrust enforcers that Google has used its market power -- and billions of dollars in exclusive deals with web browsers -- to illegally block rivals. Users have choices, and it&#x27;s easy to switch, he said. For example, Microsoft pre-selects its own search engine, Bing, on Windows PCs, yet most PC users switch to Google because it&#x27;s a better product, he said. Web browsers offered by Apple and Mozilla, which makes Firefox, have long chosen a default search engine in exchange for a revenue-share that helps pay for innovations, Schmidtlein said.

                              <span>Apple just announced its new high-end iPhones: the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. The Verge: They&#x27;re made of titanium, they have Action Buttons, and Apple promises they&#x27;re the most powerful smartphones Apple has ever made. The 15 Pro starts at $999 with 128GB of storage, and the Pro Max at $1,199 with 256GB of storage. Both will be available for preorder this Friday and on sale September 22nd. This year&#x27;s Pro has a 6.1-inch screen, and the Pro Max has a 6.7-inch display -- same as the new iPhone 15 and 15 Plus. Both are powered by the A17 Pro chip, which Apple says has the fastest performance in any smartphone and can even challenge some high-end PCs. Along with a redesigned GPU, Apple seems to think these devices could be poised to level up the kinds of games you can play on your phone.

                              <span>Inditex is racing to iron bugs out of a new anti-shoplifting system for its Zara stores, slightly delaying its rollout partly because the security tags were easy to identify and remove in initial tests, Bloomberg reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. From the report: Chief Executive Officer Oscar Garcia Maceiras unveiled the new technology in March and pledged to roll it out for tests in all Zara stores worldwide over the summer. The system relies on tiny chips known as RFID, doing away with the hard plastic tags on garments that require checkout clerks to remove them. The new technology has run into teething issues. Staff in several countries have raised concerns to management that the technology may actually make theft easier, according to the people, who asked not to be identified.

                              <span>Apple has just announced the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, and the big news is a USB-C port. From a report: We&#x27;ve been waiting for the day that the iPhone would switch to the widely used USB-C standard instead of Apple&#x27;s proprietary Lightning connector. Apple confirmed last year that it would make the change to USB-C to comply with the European Union&#x27;s upcoming regulations, and the iPhone 15 is now the first iPhone to make the switch. The iPhone 15 is priced starting at $799 for a 128GB model and the iPhone 15 Plus starts at $899 for a 128GB version. 

USB-C is good news, but if you were hoping for a totally new iPhone 15 design, well, that&#x27;s not happening this year. This year&#x27;s iPhone looks largely the same as the iPhone 14 before it, with the iPhone 15 continuing to use a 6.1-inch display. All models of the iPhone 15 will come with the Dynamic Island. That&#x27;s the pill-shaped cutout that first debuted on the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max, providing a new way to see certain notifications and interact with apps. The iPhone 15 also has an OLED Super Retina display, which supports Dolby Vision content with 1,600 nits of brightness. The peak brightness of this display is 2,000 nits in sunlight, double that of the iPhone 14.

                              <span>The World Bank poured billions of dollars into fossil fuels around the world last year despite repeated promises to refocus on shifting to a low-carbon economy, research has suggested. From a report: The money went through a special form of funding known as trade finance, which is used to facilitate global transactions. Urgewald, a campaign group that tracks global fossil fuel finance, found that the World Bank supplied about $3.7bn in trade finance in 2022 that was likely to have ended up funding oil and gas developments. 

Heike Mainhardt, the author of the research, called for reform of the World Bank and its private finance arm, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), to make such transactions more transparent and to exclude funding for fossil fuels from its lending. &quot;They can&#x27;t say that they are aligned with the Paris agreement, because there isn&#x27;t enough transparency to be able to tell,&quot; she said. Fossil fuel companies would take advantage of this, she added. &quot;They can see that they can access public money this way, without drawing attention to themselves, and they&#x27;re very clever, so they will do this,&quot; she told the Guardian. Trade finance is a form of funding more opaque than standard project finance. Whereas project finance usually flows to governments, organisations or consortiums for a particular well-defined purpose and is relatively easy to track, trade finance is more diffuse.

                              <span>Major corporations from oil and gas companies to retail giants would have to disclose their direct greenhouse gas emissions as well as those that come from activities like employee business travel under legislation passed Monday by California lawmakers, the most sweeping mandate of its kind in the nation. From a report: The legislation would require thousands of public and private businesses that operate in California and make more than $1 billion annually to report their direct and indirect emissions. The goal is to increase transparency and nudge companies to evaluate how they can cut their emissions. &quot;We are out of time on addressing the climate crisis,&quot; Democratic Assemblymember Chris Ward said. &quot;This will absolutely help us take a leap forward to be able to hold ourselves accountable.&quot; 

The legislation was one of the highest profile climate bills in California this year, racking support from major companies that include Patagonia and Apple, as well as Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the United Nations convention behind the 2015 Paris climate agreement. The bill would still need final approval by the state Senate before it can reach Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom. Lawmakers backing the bill say a large number of companies in the state already disclose some of their own emissions. But the bill is a controversial proposal that many other businesses and groups in the state oppose and say will be too burdensome.

                              <span>Alphabet&#x27;s Google pays more than $10 billion a year to maintain its position as the default search engine on web browsers and mobile devices, stifling competition, the US Justice Department said Tuesday at the start of a high-stakes antitrust trial in Washington. From a report: &quot;This case is about the future of the internet and whether Google&#x27;s search engine will ever face meaningful competition,&quot; Kenneth Dintzer, a government lawyer, said in his opening statement. &quot;The evidence will show they demanded default exclusivity to block rivals.&quot; Dintzer said Google became a monopoly by at least 2010 and today controls more than 89% of the online search market. 

&quot;The company pays billions for defaults because they are uniquely powerful,&quot; he said. &quot;For the last 12 years, Google has abused its monopoly in general search.&quot; The monopolization trial is the first pitting the federal government against a US technology company in more than two decades. The Justice Department and 52 attorneys general from states and US territories allege Google illegally maintained its monopoly by paying billions to tech rivals, smartphone makers and wireless providers in exchange for being set as the preselected option or default on mobile phones and web browsers.

                              <span>HMD Global, the Finnish company best known for producing Nokia-branded smartphones, has revealed plans to launch its own line of mobile devices. From a report: On Monday, HMD Global CEO Jean-Francois Baril announced on Linkedin that the company will be expanding its portfolio with a new HMD brand that will co-exist alongside its Nokia phones and collaborations with &quot;exciting new partners&quot; that have yet to be disclosed. &quot;It has been a great journey as &#x27;HMD -- the home of Nokia phones&#x27; -- an exclusive position we have held for the past six years,&quot; said Baril. &quot;Now we are ready for the next step on our journey -- to enter the market independently as a force to create a new world for telecommunications focused on consumer needs.&quot;

From a report: The original commitments, which were announced in July, were aimed at ensuring that AI&#x27;s considerable power was not used for destructive purposes. Google, OpenAI and OpenAI partner Microsoft signed onto the commitments in July.

                              <span>An artificial intelligence benchmark group called MLCommons unveiled the results on Monday of new tests that determine how quickly top-of-the-line hardware can run AI models. From a report: A Nvidia chip was the top performer in tests on a large language model, with a semiconductor produced by Intel a close second. The new MLPerf benchmark is based on a large language model with 6 billion parameters that summarizes CNN news articles. The benchmark simulates the &quot;inference&quot; portion of AI data crunching, which powers the software behind generative AI tools. 

Nvidia&#x27;s top submission for the inference benchmark build around eight of its flagship H100 chips. Nvidia has dominated the market for training AI models, but hasn&#x27;t captured the inference market yet. &quot;What you see is that we&#x27;re delivering leadership performance across the board, and again, delivering that leadership performance on all workloads,&quot; Nvidia&#x27;s accelerated computing marketing director, Dave Salvator, said. Intel&#x27;s success is based around its Gaudi2 chips produced by the Habana unit the company acquired in 2019. The Gaudi2 system was roughly 10% slower than Nvidia&#x27;s system.

                              <span>Credit card disputes at Visa continued rising past their pandemic boom despite the proliferation of prevention software, as fraud grows alongside e-commerce and inflation. From a report: Disputes on Visa&#x27;s network rose to more than 90 million in 2022, data provided by the payment company showed. More than 70 million disputes were filed in 2019, Visa said in a presentation, before rising 24% in 2020 during the pandemic and about 2% a year in 2021 and 2022. 

Despite being easy for consumers to file, making it one of the most-common credit card frauds, disputes are an opaque part of the payments industry. Both Mastercard Inc. and American Express declined to provide disputes data. Visa and Mastercard both bought dispute prevention companies in 2019, Verifi and Ethoca, respectively, and regularly promote their offerings at conferences. Disputes can be costly and onerous for both credit card companies and merchants to process, while chargebacks, when a dispute results in a refund, cost merchants dearly -- about $2.40 for every dollar disputed, according to Visa&#x27;s Verifi, or as high as $3.36 for every dollar, according to Mastercard&#x27;s Ethoca.

                              <span>A WhatsApp for Android beta update (version 2.23.19.8) that came out today contains a new screen called Third-party chats, reports WABetaInfo. The Verge: For now, the screen is neither functional nor accessible by users, according to WABetaInfo. But its title is a strong clue that this is likely the first step to opening Meta&#x27;s encrypted messages app to cross-platform compatibility. The beta comes just days after the European Commission confirmed that WhatsApp owner Meta meets the definition of a &quot;gatekeeper&quot; under the EU&#x27;s Digital Markets Act (DMA), which requires communication software like WhatsApp to interoperate with third-party messaging apps by March 2024.

                              <span>There&#x27;s nothing complicated about company culture.


Culture simply happens. It&#x27;s emergent behavior. There&#x27;s nothing to do, it just is.


A company&#x27;s culture is a 50-day moving average. It&#x27;s what you&#x27;ve been collectively doing as a company over the last 50 days.


How do you treat people? Who have you hired (or fired) and why? What do you when people are stressed out? How do you help people? How do you critique each other? How do you share? How do you help people who are stuck? Where&#x27;s the bar on quality? How do you support customers? How do you close deals? What have you let go on too long? What have you celebrated? What have you let slide? How honest have you been with each other and yourself.


It&#x27;s all that and a zillion other things. But it&#x27;s all stuff that actually happened, it&#x27;s not lists of things you wish had happened, or declared would happen in some ideal setting. Much of it is interpersonal, expressed both inside and outside the organization.


Why 50 days? It&#x27;s enough time for patterns to emerge, yet malleable enough to be current and honest. One day, or even a couple weeks, isn&#x27;t enough to stand for culture. A series of moments tied together loosely by near-term time just isn&#x27;t enough to establish what it&#x27;s really like somewhere. We can all be on our best behavior for a little while, but the longer while tells the truth.


Culture is the non-fiction story of an organization. It writes itself.

                              <span>Lockheed Martin may see more than $800 million in payments withheld through next June until it wins approval for the software powering its most advanced version of the F-35, according to newly disclosed delivery figures. From a report: The No. 1 US defense contractor is on tap to finish production of about 52 of the upgraded TR-3 model fighter jets by Dec. 31 and approximately 12 per month after that, or 72 more by June 30, for as many as 124 jets, according to the data released Monday by Russ Goemaere, the Pentagon&#x27;s spokesman on the F-35. 

The Pentagon is withholding $7 million per aircraft until the new software is validated because the aircraft are being placed in storage until then. At 124 jets, that&#x27;s $868 million. Last month, the Defense Department withheld $7 million on each of the first four upgraded F-35s. The aircraft needs the delay-plagued software upgrade to function fully with new cockpit hardware before it can carry more precise weapons and gather more information on enemy aircraft and air defenses. The upgrade will increase processing power 37 times and memory 20 times over the F-35&#x27;s current capabilities.

                              <span>Grocery delivery app Instacart set a target valuation that was way below its prior funding round in 2021, a sign of companies treading carefully as they test investor appetite for new listings. From a report: The San-Francisco based firm said Monday it&#x27;s pricing its shares between $26 and $28 per share. Instacart said it has 279 million shares outstanding as of Aug. 15. Including the stock options and the restricted stock units of 20.45 million and 31.47 million, respectively, the total stock for the purpose of valuing the company comes to 331 million shares. This makes for a valuation between $8.6 billion to $9.3 billion, far below its valuation of $39 billion set in a fundraising round in 2021. The company&#x27;s internal valuation last year in March was $24 billion, and in July was reduced to $15 billion to reflect the selloff in technology stocks, a person familiar with the matter had told Barron&#x27;s.

                              <span>The European Union has lowered its forecast for economic growth this year and next, saying inflation is taking a heavy toll on people&#x27;s willingness to spend in shops -- while higher interest rates are sharply restricting the credit needed for investment and purchases. From a report: The revised forecast Monday from the European Commission, the EU&#x27;s executive arm, comes as fears of recession grow and as the European Central Bank faces a key decision this week on whether to keep raising rates, which are aimed at getting inflation under control. The 20 countries that use the euro currency are expected to see growth of 0.8% this year instead of 1.1% projected in the spring forecast, the commission said. For next year, growth expectations were lowered to 1.3% from 1.6%. For the broader 27-country EU, the forecast also was lowered to 0.8% from 1% this year and to 1.4% from 1.7% next year. 

&quot;Weakness in domestic demand, in particular consumption, shows that high and still increasing consumer prices for most goods and services are taking a heavier toll than expected,&quot; a commission statement said. EU Economy Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said at a news conference that &quot;further weakening in the coming months&quot; was foreseen as the economy faces &quot;multiple headwinds.&quot; One source of uncertainty is how far the ECB will go on interest rates -- more expensive credit restrains economic growth in some areas such as real estate, but if higher rates succeed in lowering inflation, that would boost consumer spending power.

                              <span>Microsoft has made it clear: it will ax third-party printer drivers in Windows. From a report: The death rattle will be lengthy, as the timeline for the end of servicing stretches into 2027 -- although Microsoft noted that the dates will be subject to change. There is, after all, always that important customer with a strange old printer lacking Mopria support. 

Mopria is part of the Windows&#x27; teams justification for removing support. Founded in 2013 by Canon, HP, Samsung and Xerox, the Mopria Alliance&#x27;s mission is to provide universal standards for printing and scanning. Epson, Lexmark, Adobe and Microsoft have also joined the gang since then. Since Windows 10 21H2, Microsoft has baked Mopria support into the flagship operating system, with support for devices connected via the network or USB, thanks to the Microsoft IPP Class driver. Microsoft said: &quot;This removes the need for print device manufacturers to provide their own installers, drivers, utilities, and so on.&quot;

                              <span>The U.S. Copyright Office has again rejected copyright protection for art created using artificial intelligence, denying a request by artist Jason M. Allen for a copyright covering an award-winning image he created with the generative AI system Midjourney. From a report: The office said on Tuesday that Allen&#x27;s science-fiction themed image &quot;Theatre D&#x27;opera Spatial&quot; was not entitled to copyright protection because it was not the product of human authorship. The Copyright Office in February rescinded copyrights for images that artist Kris Kashtanova created using Midjourney for a graphic novel called &quot;Zarya of the Dawn,&quot; dismissing the argument that the images showed Kashtanova&#x27;s own creative expression. 

It has also rejected a copyright for an image that computer scientist Stephen Thaler said his AI system created autonomously. Allen said on Wednesday that the office&#x27;s decision on his work was expected, but he was &quot;certain we will win in the end.&quot; &quot;If this stands, it is going to create more problems than it solves,&quot; Allen said. &quot;This is going to create new and creative problems for the copyright office in ways we can&#x27;t even speculate yet.&quot;

                              <span>Microsoft is done supporting the original Surface Duo, three years after it first launched on September 10. From a report: The company has stated from the very start that the Surface Duo would receive just three years of OS updates, meaning today is the last day that Microsoft has to stay true to its word. Going forward, Microsoft will no longer ship new OS updates or security patches for the original Surface Duo, meaning Android 12L is the last version of the OS it will ever officially receive. Surface Duo only ever got two major OS updates, one shy of the average three that most high-end flagship Android devices get these days.

                              <span>Slash_Account_Dot shares a report: The FBI had a problem. In 2019 the agency was secretly running an encrypted phone company called Anom. Serious organized criminals were using the phones and Anom was gaining popularity. But even though Anom contained a backdoor -- a chunk of code that silently copied every message sent -- the FBI was unable to actually read Anom&#x27;s messages. The FBI had not obtained legal approval to rummage through that treasure trove of intelligence. 

[...] So the agency turned to what court records have described as a &quot;third country,&quot; the first country being America and the second being Australia, which ran a beta test of the Anom surveillance operation. The third country allowed the FBI to overcome this legal hurdle. The country hosted the Anom interception server for the FBI, and then provided Anom&#x27;s messages to American authorities every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. That country &quot;requested its participation be kept confidential,&quot; according to a document I previously obtained. The document said the third country was a European Union member but did not name the country itself. &quot;The FBI is neither now nor in the future in a position to release the identity of the aforementioned third country,&quot; the document added. That country was Lithuania, 404 Media has learned from a source briefed on the operation but who did not work on it on the U.S. side.

                              <span>Sundar Pichai said Google&#x27;s longstanding relationship with chipmaker Nvidia isn&#x27;t going to change any time soon -- in fact, he expects it to continue over the next 10 years. From a report: In an interview Wired published Monday, the Google CEO said the company worked &quot;deeply&quot; with Nvidia on Android and other initiatives for over a decade, adding that Nvidia has a &quot;strong track record&quot; with AI innovation. &quot;Look, the semiconductor industry is a very dynamic, cooperative industry,&quot; Pichai said. &quot;It&#x27;s an industry that needs deep, long-term R&amp;D and investments. I feel comfortable about our relationship with Nvidia and that we are going to be working closely with them 10 years from now.&quot;

                              <span>Apple is extending an agreement to get modem semiconductors from Qualcomm for three more years, a sign that its ambitious effort to design the chips in-house is taking longer than expected. From a report: The new pact will cover &quot;smartphone launches in 2024, 2025 and 2026,&quot; Qualcomm said in a statement Monday. The companies&#x27; agreement had been set to end this year, and the latest iPhone -- due on Tuesday -- was expected to be one of the last to rely on the Qualcomm modem chip. Instead, Qualcomm will maintain its lucrative position within Apple&#x27;s supply chain. The iPhone maker is Qualcomm&#x27;s largest customer -- accounting for nearly a quarter of revenue, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. And their relationship helps validate Qualcomm&#x27;s claim to having the best smartphone modem, a critical component that allows devices to connect to the internet and make calls. Starting with the iPhone 12 generation, the chip has supported speedier 5G networks.

                              <span>An anonymous Slashdot reader shared this report from the New York Times:

The collapse in cryptocurrency prices last year forced a procession of major firms into bankruptcy, triggering a government crackdown and erasing the savings of millions of inexperienced investors. But for a small group of corporate turnaround specialists, crypto&#x27;s implosion has become a financial bonanza. 

Lawyers, accountants, consultants, cryptocurrency analysts and other professionals have racked up more than $700 million in fees since last year from the bankruptcies of five major crypto firms, including the digital currency exchange FTX, according to a New York Times analysis of court records. That sum is likely to grow significantly as the cases unfold over the coming months.
Large fees are common in corporate bankruptcies, which require complex and time-intensive legal work to untangle. But in the crypto world, the mounting fees have sparked widespread outrage because many of the people owed money are amateur traders who lost their personal savings, rather than corporations with the ability to weather a financial crisis. Every dollar in fees is deducted from the pool of funds that will be returned to creditors at the end of the bankruptcies. 

The fees are &quot;exorbitant and ridiculous,&quot; said Daniel Frishberg, a 19-year-old investor who lost about $3,000 when the crypto company Celsius Network filed for bankruptcy last year. &quot;At every hearing, they have an army of people there, and most of them don&#x27;t need to be there. You don&#x27;t need 20 people taking notes.&quot;

                              <span>Last week IEEE Spectrum released its 10th annual rankings of the Top Programming Languages.
It choose a top language for each of three categories: 	actively used among typical IEEE members and working software engineers, in demand by employers, or &quot;in the zeitgeist&quot;. 


The results?

This year, Python doesn&#x27;t just remain No. 1 in our general &quot;Spectrum&quot; ranking — which is weighted to reflect the interests of the typical IEEE member — but it widens its lead. 

Python&#x27;s increased dominance appears to be largely at the expense of smaller, more specialized, languages. It has become the jack-of-all-trades language — and the master of some, such as AI, where powerful and extensive libraries make it ubiquitous. And although Moore&#x27;s Law is winding down for high-end computing, low-end microcontrolle…</span>

                              <span>Earlier this year, Singapore-based embedded security researcher yeokm1 built a ChatGPT client for MS-DOS. 
Now they&#x27;re back with a new project:
HDMI is a relatively modern video connector we take for granted on modern PCs and monitors. Now vintage PCs can join in the fun too with a native connection to modern HDMI monitors without any additional adapter. 

Two years ago, I learned of an open-source project called Graphics Gremlin by Eric Schlaepfer who runs the website Tubetime.us. It is an 8-bit ISA graphics card that supports display standards like Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) and Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA). CGA and MDA are display standards used by older IBM(-compatible) PCs in the 1980s. The frequencies and connectors used by CGA and MDA are no longer supported by modern monitors hence it is difficult for older PCs of the 1980s era to have modern displays connected to them without external adapters. Graphics Gremline addresses this problem by using techniques like scan doubling (for CGA) and increasing the vertical refresh rate (for MDA) then outputing to a relatively newer but still old VGA port. 

I fabricated and assembled the design then installed it into my IBM5155... I decided to modify the Graphics Gremlin design so it can connect natively to an external HDMI monitor and service the internal Composite-based CRT at the same time. 

The post concludes triumphantly with a photo of their IBM 5155 running the CGA Compatibility Tester displaying the color palette.

                              <span>When we first got our Tesla Model X four years ago, I wasn&#x27;t the biggest fan. Build quality was spotty, brakes didn&#x27;t match the performance, and handling was at best so-so. But it could carry seven, including luggage, was electric, and the dual-motor acceleration was a hoot. So it stayed in the garage, pending competition on these criteria. Well, now we got a Mercedes EQS SUV, which also carries seven, is electric, and is fun-fast for its size. But the Tesla still wins!
At least in judgement of the rest of the family. Their verdict was unanimous. The Tesla is &quot;less fuzzy&quot;, &quot;more fun&quot;, &quot;has games&quot;, and even is &quot;more comfortable&quot;. Now, personally, I appreciate the German build quality, prefer CarPlay over Tesla&#x27;s UI, and love the quieter cabin. But I&#x27;m clearly in the minority. Even though the Mercedes is considerably more money, and brand new, the rest of the family would rather keep the Tesla.
This is what the legacy car industry is up against. Most of its traditional virtues under attack by a huge portion of the market who just don&#x27;t give a damn. To whom the fact that, for example, Tesla has a sense of humor trumps the minor niggles it might still have compared to the legacy competition. It&#x27;s fascinating.
And even for people like yours truly, who absolutely do appreciate those traditional virtues, it&#x27;s becoming harder and harder to hate on Tesla. I mean look at the performance of the Plaid, with its 1,020 horsepower, and compare the fact that it&#x27;s now a mere $90,000. For a car that&#x27;ll beat a Bugatti Chiron, along with virtually every other car on the planet, in the quarter mile. That&#x27;s just ridiculous.
So the Model X is staying, and I&#x27;ve put down an order for a Model S Plaid. GG, Elon.</span>

&quot;Four million fewer teenagers enrolled at a college in 2022 than in 2012.&quot;


 For many, the price tag has simply grown too exorbitant to justify the cost. From 2010 to 2022, college tuition rose an average of 12% a year, while overall inflation only increased an average of 2.6% each year. Today it costs at least $104,108 on average to attend four years of public university — and $223,360 for a private university. 


At the same time, the salaries students can expect to earn after graduation haven&#x27;t kept up with the cost of college. A 2019 report from the Pew Research Center found that earnings for young college-educated workers had remained mostly flat over the past 50 years. Four years …</span>

More from MarketWatch:

Citing jail records, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Sunday that a man identified as game developer Mikhail Olson, known by the nickname Simbuilder, was arrested by U.S. Park Police on suspicion of having a concealed firearm in his vehicle, along with armor-piercing ammunition and a large-capacity magazine.

 
The awards ceremony was held at Fort Mason Center, which is on federal property. According to the Chronicle, the suspect was arrested Saturday afternoon after allegedly assaulting U.S. Park Police officers who had been called over a report of a disturbance outside the Roblox conference.

The cost of building an artificial intelligence product like ChatGPT can be hard to measure. But one thing Microsoft-backed OpenAI needed for its technology was plenty of water, pulled from the watershed of the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers in central Iowa to cool a powerful supercomputer as it helped teach its AI systems how to mimic human writing. 

 As they race to capitalize on a craze for generative AI, leading tech developers including Microsoft, OpenAI and Google have acknowledged that growing demand for their AI tools carries hefty costs, from expensive semiconductors to an increase in water consumption. But they&#x27;re often secretive about the specifics. Few people in Iowa knew about its status as a birthplac…</span>

                              <span>One year ago NASA crashed its DART spacecraft into the asteroid &quot;Dimorphos&quot; (which orbits around a much larger asteroid named &quot;Didymos&quot;). The BBC calls the mission &quot;part of an experiment to change the space rock&#x27;s direction and test Earth&#x27;s defences against asteroids in the future. 

&quot;However, a teacher and his class studying the rock have now discovered that since the collision, it has moved in a strange and unexpected way.&quot;
[U]sing their school telescope, a team of children and their teacher Jonathan Swift at Thacher School in California have found that more than a month after the collision, Dimorphos&#x27; orbit continuously slowed after impact... which is unusual and unexpected. As reported in the New Scientist, the team presented their findings at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society. 

After discovering the unusual behaviour of Dimorphos, it&#x27;s likely that Nasa will have to factor in the high school&#x27;s findings, if they ever launch another asteroid redirection mission in the future...

One explanation for the asteroid&#x27;s orbit continuing to change so long after the Dart collision is that material thrown up by the impact, including rocks several metres across, eventually fell back onto the surface of the asteroid, changing its orbit even more. The European Space Agency is launching a mission called Hera, which will arrive at Dimorphos in 2026 and could reveal more details as to what happened to the asteroid following the impact.

After the great Reddit protests, all three were removed from their positions. But now Ars Technica asks whether Reddit&#x27;s replacement moderators will be as capable of spotting dangerous advice?
In response to concerns that the new r/homeautomation mod team could overlook posts with dangerous misinformation, one moderator requesting anonymity pointed me to the subreddit&#x27;s sidebar, which has a disclaimer about the dangers of electricity.

The uses of WebAssembly, aka Wasm, have grown far beyond its initial target of web applications, according to The State of WebAssembly 2023 report. But some developers remain skeptical.

Released September 6 by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and SlashData, in collaboration with the Linux Foundation, the report finds mostly optimism among software developers about future adoption of Wasm for web and non-web environments... However, about 22% of participants in the report indicated pessimism about Wasm adoption for either the web or non-web environments. Further, 83% of the respondents reported challenges with Wasm including difficulties with debugging and troubleshooting, different performance between runtimes, lack of consistent developer experiences between runtimes, lack of learning materials, and compatibility issues with certain browsers. 

The report finds that respondents are using WebAssembly across a wide range of software projects including data visualization (35%), internet of things (32%, artificial intelligence (30%), games (28%), back-end services (27%), edge computing (25%), and more. While Wasm is still primarily used to develop web applications (58%), this is changing thanks to WASI (WebAssembly System Interface), which provides a modular interface for Wasm... 

Other findings of the State of WebAssembly 2023 report: 
- When migrating existing applications to Wasm, 30% of respondents experience performance benefits of more than 50%.
- JavaScript is the most popular language used with Wasm applications. But Rust stands out in popularity in Wasm projects compared to other use cases...
 

The article says WebAssembly developers were attracted by &quot;faster loading times, the ability to explore new use cases and technologies, and the ability to share code between projects. Improved performance over JavaScript and efficient execution of computationally intensive tasks also were cited.&quot;

                              <span>CNN reports:

The first experiment to produce oxygen on another planet has come to an end on Mars after exceeding NASA&#x27;s initial goals and demonstrating capabilities that could help future astronauts explore the red planet. The microwave-size device called MOXIE, or Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment, is on the Perseverance rover. 

The experiment kicked off more than two years ago, a few months after the rover landed on Mars. Since then, MOXIE has generated 122 grams of oxygen, equal to what a small dog breathes in 10 hours, according to NASA. The instrument works by converting some of Mars&#x27; plentiful carbon dioxide into oxygen. During the peak of its efficiency, MOXIE produced 12 grams of oxygen an hour at 98% purity or better, which is twice as much as NASA&#x27;s goals for the instrument. On August 7, MOXIE operated for the 16th and final time, having completed all its requirements...



Bigger and better versions of something such as MOXIE in the future could supply life support systems with breathable air and convert and store oxygen needed for rocket fuel used to launch on a return trip to Earth. 

In a statement NASA applauded the performance of the MIT-created experiment. &quot;When the first astronauts land on Mars, they may have the descendants of a microwave-oven-size device to thank for the air they breathe and the rocket propellant that gets them home... 

&quot;Rather than bringing large quantities of oxygen with them to Mars, future astronauts could live off the land, using materials they find on the planet&#x27;s surface to survive.&quot;

                              <span>Last Monday the U.S. celebrated Labor Day, the federal holiday honoring America&#x27;s labor movement and the contributions of U.S. workers. On that day a small protest was held outside Cruise&#x27;s headquarters in San Francisco — featuring taxi drivers and mass transit workers. 

CBS News spoke to Edward Escobar, a Bay Area Uber driver and director of the Alliance for Independent Workers. They report that Escobar orchestrated the protest &quot;to convey their concerns about the potential impact of robotaxis on their jobs.

&quot;There isn&#x27;t any dialogue happening. It&#x27;s pretty much one-sided. It&#x27;s being dictated by the tech titans, Waymo, which is Google, and General Motors, which is Cruise,&quot; Escobar said. &quot;And they&#x27;re pretty much dictating the terms, and the California Public Utilities Commission is allowin…</span>

 If realized, Eos Energy&#x27;s utility- and industrial-scale zinc-bromine battery energy storage system could provide cheaper, vastly more sustainable options for the country&#x27;s burgeoning renewable power infrastructure... Unlike lithium-ion and lithium iron phosphate batteries, alternatives such as the Eos Z3 design rely on zinc-based cathodes alongside a water-based electrolyte, notes MIT Technology Review. This important distinction both increases their stability, as well as makes it incredibly difficult for them to support combustion. Zinc-bromine batteries meanwhi…</span>

                              <span>Star Trek: The Animated Series was a half-hour Saturday morning cartoon that premiered exactly one half century ago — yesterday. You can watch its opening credits sequence on YouTube — with its strange 1970s version of the theme song. CBS&#x27;s YouTube channel also offers clips from various episodes. 

Starting in 1973, it ran for two seasons — a total of just 22 episodes. But the BBC notes it kept Star Trek in people&#x27;s minds after the original series had been cancelled in 1969:

While The Original Series had struggled in the ratings during its initial run, the show thrived in syndication, and created the phenomenon of fan conventions (think Comic-con in the present day). Because of this, studios were interested in more Star Trek, but there was a problem: the sets had been scrapped, the costum…</span>

                              <span>Localhost is the inevitable victim of every software’s commercial success.
Assume you’re a fintech running a Ruby on Rails monolith. If you ever get to PMF, you’ll inevitably have to scale to process more transactions, or you’ll have to hire more engineers to build ancillary features.
When that happens, you’ll have to break your monolith into microservices so it scales more efficiently or so that multiple teams can deploy software without stepping on each other’s toes.
Or someone in your company may have gone to too many AWS conferences and may want to sprinkle some lambdas here and there. “It’s scalable”, they’ll say.
As that happens, there will be a point of no return in which engineers can’t run the whole system on their machines anymore — at least not in a reliable way.

“People always asked me why I was smiling. Other guys had a sour face or they were pissed off that they had to do another rep or another set. But I looked forward to the work. Why? Because I knew that with every rep that I did, every set that I did, with every weight that I lifted, I got one step closer to turning my vision into reality.”
This is not how most people approach achievement. We get discouraged, are inconsistent, and let our own plans fall through. We get frustrated, punish, and guilt ourselves into trudging forward.
It doesn&#x27;t get better even if we achieve our goals. There’s a brief respite after crossing the finish line — but once we inevitably set a new goal, we’re running towards yet another finish line and beating o…</span>

                              <span>&quot;12 people account for the lion&#x27;s share of anti-vaccination propaganda posted to three of the leading social media outlets,&quot; NPR reported in 2021, citing a study from a London-based group opposed to online hate and disinformation.&quot; 

But this week Ars Technica reports that one of those 12 &quot;lost a lawsuit attempting to force YouTube to provide access to videos that were removed from the platform after YouTube banned his channels.&quot;

Joseph Mercola had tried to argue that YouTube owed him more than $75,000 in damages for breaching its own user contract and denying him access to his videos. However, in an order dismissing Mercola&#x27;s complaint, U.S. magistrate judge Laurel Beeler wrote that according to the contract Mercola signed, YouTube was &quot;under no obligation to host&quot; Mercola&#x27;s content after terminating his channel in 2021 &quot;for violating YouTube&#x27;s Community Guidelines by posting medical misinformation about COVID-19 and vaccines.&quot; 

&quot;The court found no breach because &#x27;there is no provision in the Terms of Service that requires YouTube to maintain particular content&#x27; or be a &#x27;storage site for users&#x27; content,&#x27;&quot; Beeler wrote. Because Mercola&#x27;s contract with YouTube was found to be enforceable and &quot;YouTube had the discretion to take down content that harmed its users,&quot; Beeler said that Mercola did not plausibly plead claims for breach of contract or unjust enrichment. 

Mercola&#x27;s complaint was dismissed without leave to amend.

Now the U.S. government &quot;plans to fix that by crisscrossing the reservation with fiber-optic cable — at an average cost of $53,000 for each household and workplace connected.&quot; 
While that amount exceeds the assessed value of some of the 658 homes getting hookups — at a cost of $35.2 million — &quot;the tribe is also starting an internet company to run the network, creating jobs and competing with an existing provider known for slow customer service.&quot;

                              <span>The Washington Post reports:
 Japan launched a lunar mission Thursday, overcoming multiple failures and delays to become the fifth country to head to the moon — just weeks after India — in a global race to better understand Earth&#x27;s closest neighbor... It is scheduled to enter the moon&#x27;s orbit in three to four months and land early next year. 


The rocket is carrying two space missions: a new X-ray telescope to help scientists better understand the origins of the universe and a lightweight high-precision moon lander that will serve as the basis for future moon landing technology. The telescope separated at 8:56 a.m., and the moon lander separated at 9:29 a.m... 

Japan has made several attempts to reach the moon, including its Omotenashi project to land an ultrasmall probe. In November, Japan abandoned the project after failing to restore communications with the spacecraft. Earlier this year, Tokyo-based space company ispace also pulled the plug on the first Japanese private-sector attempt to land on the moon. 
Japan&#x27;s high-precision lander hopes to land within 328 feet (100 meters) of its target — which the article says it &quot;much closer than conventional lunar landers, which usually have an accuracy of several kilometers.&quot;

                              <span>Huawei&#x27;s launch last week of the Mate 60 Pro smartphone &quot;shocked industry experts,&quot; reports CNN, who didn&#x27;t understand how Huawei &quot;would have the ability to manufacture such an advanced smartphone following sweeping efforts by the United States to restrict China&#x27;s access to foreign chip technology.&quot; 

And in a related note, CNN adds that South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix &quot;is investigating how two of its memory chips mysteriously ended up inside the Mate 60 Pro, a controversial smartphone launched by Huawei last week.&quot;

Shares in Hynix fell more than 4% on Friday after it emerged that two of its products, a 12 gigabyte (GB) LPDDR5 chip and 512 GB NAND flash memory chip, were found inside the Huawei handset by TechInsights, a research organization based in Canada specializing in semiconductors, which took the phone apart for analysis. &quot;The significance of the development is that there are restrictions on what SK Hynix can ship to China,&quot; G Dan Hutcheson, vice chair of TechInsights, told CNN. &quot;Where do these chips come from? The big question is whether any laws were violated.&quot; 

 A Hynix spokesperson told CNN Friday that it was aware of its chips being used in the Huawei phone and had started investigating the issue. 

The company &quot;no longer does business with Huawei since the introduction of the U.S. restrictions against the company,&quot; it said in a statement... Industry insiders said it was possible that Huawei had purchased the memory chips from the secondary market and not directly from the manufacturer. It&#x27;s also possible Huawei may have had a stockpile of components accumulated before the U.S. export curbs kicked in fully.

Long-time Slashdot reader theodp writes:
Some of the main findings of the report include: 
 1. The promise of education technology was overstated
2. Remote online learning worsened education disparities
3. Learning was hindered and altered
4. Regulation and guardrails are needed. 

Remember that the report covers countries around the world, with different levels of economic development. One section of the report is actually titled, &quot;Most learners were left behind,&quot; citing estimates that &quot;at least half of all students expected to access remote learning systems to continue their education were unable to do so due to technology gaps... In many parts of the world, accessing education via a technology portal was so uncommon and so unrealistic that many families did not even know that the option existed when schools closed.&quot;

This should not have come as a particular surprise. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the specialized agency of the United Nations for ICT, estimated that approximately 3.7 billion people — roughly half of the world&#x27;s population — lacked a functional internet connection in 2020... Countries around the world invested heavily in internet-connected solutions for education, even though these solutions commonly reached only a minority of students, resulting in a bifurcation of educational opportunity. 

The report begins with a warning from the agency&#x27;s assistant director-general for education. &quot;Ultimately, we should heed this publication&#x27;s recommendation to exercise greater humility and caution when considering the educational promise of the latest technological marvels.&quot;

                              <span>Rotten Tomatoes celebrated its 25th year of assigning scores to movies based on their aggregate review. Now Vulture writes that Rotten Tomatoes &quot;can make or break&quot; movies, &quot;with implications for how films are perceived, released, marketed, and possibly even green-lit&quot;. But unfortuately, the site &quot;is also erratic, reductive, and easily hacked.&quot; 

Vulture tells the story of a movie-publicity company contacting &quot;obscure, often self-published critics&quot; to say the film&#x27;s teams &quot;feel like it would benefit from more input from different critics&quot; — while making undisclosed payments of $50 or more.) A critic asking if it&#x27;s okay to pan the movie was informed that &quot;super nice&quot; critics move their bad reviews onto sites not included in Rotten Tomatoes scores.

                              <span>On August 30th the University of Michigan announced it had finally restored its internet connectivity and Wi-Fi network, according to the Ann Arbor News, &quot;after several days of outages caused by a &#x27;significant security concern,&#x27; officials said.&quot; The outage coincided with the first days of the new school year, although &quot;classes continued through the outage.&quot;
The internet was shut down on 1:45 p.m. on Sunday, Aug. 27, after the Information Assurance team at the university identified a security concern, according to previous reporting. The Information Assurance team fights cybersecurity threats and malicious actors... The investigation into the security issue is ongoing and no other information will be released, said Santa Ono, president of University of Michigan.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this report from the senior space editor at Ars Technica:
In a new report, the federal department charged with analyzing how efficiently U.S. taxpayer dollars are spent, the Government Accountability Office, says NASA lacks transparency on the true costs of its Space Launch System rocket program. Published on Thursday, the new report (see .pdf) examines the billions of dollars spent by NASA on the development of the massive rocket, which made a successful debut launch in late 2022 with the Artemis I mission. Surprisingly, as part of the reporting process, NASA officials admitted the rocket was too expensive to support its lunar exploration efforts as part of the Artemis program. &quot;Senior NASA officials told GAO that at current cost levels, the SLS program is unaffordable,&quot; the new report states... 


Moreover, the report indicates that NASA has not regularly updated its five-year production cost estimates for the rocket. The report also cites concerns about development costs of future hardware for NASA&#x27;s big-ticket rocket program, including the Exploration Upper Stage. Another problem with NASA&#x27;s cost estimates is that they do not appear to account for delays to Artemis missions. It is probable that the Artemis II mission, a crewed flight around the Moon, will launch no earlier than 2025. The Artemis III crewed landing will likely slip to at least 2026, if not more, with additional delays down the line... 


NASA officials interviewed by the Government Accountability Office acknowledged that they were concerned about the costs of the SLS rocket. &quot;NASA recognizes the need to improve the affordability of the SLS program and is taking steps to do so,&quot; the report states. &quot;Senior agency officials have told us that at current cost levels the SLS program is unsustainable and exceeds what NASA officials believe will be available for its Artemis missions.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Bloomberg: Cryptocurrency trading volume declined in August to the lowest level of the year, another sign of waning investor interest since the collapse of digital asset prices from all-time highs in late 2021. The combined monthly volume of so-called spot and derivatives trading fell 11.5% to $2.09 trillion, and was the second-lowest monthly total since October 2020, according to data compiled by CCData. &quot;The (spot) trading volumes on centralized exchanges have remained low since April this year and are now comparable to the stagnant trading activity in the bear market of 2019,&quot; CCData said in a report published Thursday.
 
The tepid interest appears to be carrying into September, with crypto bellwether Bitcoin little changed through much of the first week of the month. Bitcoin, which accounts for about half of crypto&#x27;s $1 trillion market capitalization, was little changed at around $25,800 on Thursday. It almost reached $69,000 in November 2021. [...] While Binance remains the largest exchange for crypto spot trading, its market share shrank for the sixth straight month, settling at 38.5%, the lowest since August 2022, according to CCData.

                              <span>A web caching issue resulted in some Wyze security camera owners being able to see webcam feeds that weren&#x27;t theirs. The Verge reports: Earlier on Friday, users on Reddit made posts about the issue. &quot;Went to check on my cameras and they are all gone be replaced with a new one... and this isn&#x27;t mine!&quot; wrote one user. &quot;Apologies if this is your house / dog... I don&#x27;t want it showing up as much as you don&#x27;t want it!&quot; &quot;I am able to click the events tab and see ALL the events on this random person&#x27;s camera INSIDE their house,&quot; wrote another. &quot;I don&#x27;t know why, but I can see someone else&#x27;s camera,&quot; wrote another.
 
Each thread has comments from other Reddit users reporting similar issues. Shockingly, I even saw some instances of people claiming they saw the same cameras that other people did. The user reports indicated that they were seeing the other feeds through Wyze&#x27;s web viewer at view.wyze.com.

The Washington Post reports: Released in 1987 by Forethought, a small software firm, PowerPoint was the digital successor to overhead projectors, transforming the labor-intensive process of creating slides -- a task typically assigned to design departments or outsourced -- to one where any employee with a computer could point, click and rearrange information with a mouse. &quot;Our users were familiar with computers, but probably not graphics software,&quot; Mr. Austin wrote in an unpublished history of the software&#x27;s development. &quot;They were highly motivated to look their best in front of others, but they weren&#x27;t savvy in graphics design.&quot;
 
Working alongside Robert Gaskins, the Forethought executive who conceived the software, it was Mr. Austin&#x27;s job as the software engineer to make PowerPoint (originally called Presenter) easy to operate. He accomplished this with a &quot;direct-manipulation interface,&quot; he wrote, meaning that &quot;what you are editing looks exactly like the final product.&quot; Originally targeted for Macintosh computers, which had a graphical interface, Presenter included ways for users to incorporate graphics, clip art and multiple fonts. In addition, the slides could be uniform with graphic borders, corporate logos and slide numbers. The goal, Mr. Austin wrote, was &quot;to create presentations -- not simply slides.&quot;
 
In his book &quot;Sweating Bullets: Notes about Inventing PowerPoint&quot; (2012), Gaskins wrote that &quot;Dennis came up with at least half of the major design ideas,&quot; and was &quot;completely responsible for the fluid performance and the polished finish of the implementation.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s a good bet,&quot; Gaskins added, &quot;that if Dennis had not been the person designing PowerPoint, no one would ever have heard of it.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from 404 Media: Historically, video game preservation efforts usually cover two types of games. The most common are very old or &quot;retro&quot; games from the 16-bit era or earlier, which are trapped on cartridges until they&#x27;re liberated via downloadable ROMs. The other are games that rely on a live service, like Enter the Matrix&#x27;s now unplugged servers or whatever games you can only get by downloading them via Nintendo&#x27;s Wii Shop Channel, which shut down in 2019. But time keeps marching on and a more recent era of games now needs to be attended to if we still want those games to be accessible: indies from the late aughts to mid twenty-teens. That&#x27;s right. Fez, an icon of the era and indie games scene, is now more than a decade old. And while we don&#x27;t think of t…</span>

                              <span>The SEC has approved the Nasdaq&#x27;s request to operate the first exchange AI-driven order type. CoinTelegraph reports: Called the dynamic midpoint extended life order (M-ELO), the new system expands on the M-ELO automated order type by making it &quot;dynamic,&quot; meaning it will use artificial intelligence to update and, essentially, recalibrate itself in real-time. Order types are a set of software instructions that execute specific trade pairs at exact market pricing thresholds. This form of automation has been around for a while, but the new AI-driven order type is the first of its kind to use real-time reinforcement learning AI to execute orders
 
This should have the follow-on effect of substantially speeding up orders placed with the system. In a blog post accompanying the approval announcement, Nasdaq states that dynamic M-ELO demonstrated a &quot;20.3% increase in fill rates and an 11.4% reduction in mark-outs&quot; during its research and testing. According to a data sheet published by Nasdaq: &quot;Calculated on a symbol-by-symbol basis, this new functionality analyzes 140+ data points every 30 seconds to detect market conditions and optimize the holding period prior to which a trade is eligible to execute.&quot; By adjusting the holding periods for orders in real time, as opposed to the traditional system that simply applies static timeouts to orders, fill rates should increase without a significant increase in market impact.

                              <span>According to Android specialist Mishaal Rahman, Android miscalculates the storage space taken up by system components, leading to inflated system storage utilization and potentially misleading users. Chandraveer Mathur writes via Android Police. From the report: We usually rely on Android&#x27;s storage utilization utility to find apps and files eating up storage space, so we can uninstall or delete them if required. However, Android specialist Mishaal Rahman discovered that Google&#x27;s calculation of the space consumed by Android system components is flawed. He executed shell commands to create a 3GB file in the /data/media/0 storage directory, which isn&#x27;t a file path used for Android system files. However, the phone&#x27;s storage breakdown showed a marked 3GB increase under the System heading, suggesting the OS suddenly became bigger.
 
This happens because Android calculates system storage as the space used up by anything other than what&#x27;s covered by other categories in the storage breakdown, including audios, videos, images, documents, trash, and games. This means the System heading in the break doesn&#x27;t just include Android system files. Android 14 also uses this dangerously flawed logic for calculating storage usage. Moreover, the Files app by Google also shows similar storage utilization by Android system components, perhaps because it uses the same incredulous attribution logic. By association, all other Android skins use flawed calculation of used storage space, but Samsung reportedly fixed this issue with the One UI 6 update. After running similar ADB commands as in the previous experiment, Rahman could confirm the increased utilization showed up under the Other files heading in the storage breakdown, instead of the System heading.

                              <span>Indonesia has awarded OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman its first &quot;Golden Visa&quot; -- a week after the program was launched to attract foreign investment to Southeast Asia&#x27;s largest economy. CNBC reports: &quot;There are several categories of golden visas apart from those based on investment/capital investment, one of which is the golden visa which is given to figures who have an international reputation and can provide benefits for Indonesia,&quot; Silmy Karim, Indonesia&#x27;s director general of immigration, said in a statement. &quot;With this golden visa, the hope is that Altman can contribute towards the development and use of AI in Indonesia,&quot; Karim said.
 
Altman&#x27;s Golden Visa is for 10 years. As a holder of the visa, the American entrepreneur will get to enjoy priority screening at airports across the country&#x27;s vast archipelago, along with longer periods of stay, and ease of entry and exit.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: Apple released security updates on Thursday that patch two zero-day exploits -- meaning hacking techniques that were unknown at the time Apple found out about them -- used against a member of a civil society organization in Washington, D.C., according to the researchers who found the vulnerabilities. Citizen Lab, an internet watchdog group that investigates government malware, published a short blog post explaining that last week they found a zero-click vulnerability -- meaning that the hackers&#x27; target doesn&#x27;t have to tap or click anything, such as an attachment -- used to target victims with malware.
 
The researchers said the vulnerability was used as part of an exploit chain designed to deliver NSO Group&#x27;s malware, known as Pegasus. &quot;The exploit chain was capable of compromising iPhones running the latest version of iOS (16.6) without any interaction from the victim,&quot; Citizen Lab wrote. Once they found the vulnerability, the researchers reported it to Apple, which released a patch on Thursday, thanking Citizen Lab for reporting them. Based on what Citizen Lab wrote in the blog post, and the fact that Apple also patched another vulnerability and attributed its finding to the company itself, it appears Apple may have found the second vulnerability while investigating the first. Citizen Lab researcher John Scott-Railton says Apple&#x27;s Lockdown Mode would have blocked the exploits found in this case. Lockdown Mode is an opt-in feature introduced in iOS 16 that gives users the option to temporarily switch off or limit features for security purposes. According to Apple, it &quot;should be used only if you believe you may be targeted by a highly sophisticated cyberattack, such as by a private company developing state-sponsored mercenary spyware.&quot;

According to the startup, these new formats are poised to address density, performance, and access paradigms, as well as the cost and sustainability demands of datacenters. Cerabyte, a German storage startup, has published an abstract from its upcoming presentation at the 2023 Storage Developer Conference in Fremont, California (h/t Blocks and Files).

                              <span>The FTC&#x27;s chief administrative law judge (ALJ) ruled that Intuit, the parent company of TurboTax, &quot;deceived consumers&quot; and &quot;engaged in deceptive advertising&quot; by advertising its &quot;Free Edition&quot; tax filing service as free when users ultimately had to pay. The Verge reports: The ruling (PDF) includes several pages of commercials and online ads where Intuit advertised its &quot;Free Edition&quot; software. While the name implies that the service is, well, free, people wound up having to pay to use it -- sparking a lawsuit from the FTC and a $141 million payout to affected users. Meanwhile, Intuit&#x27;s actually no-cost Free File version, which it launched in partnership with the IRS, remained exceedingly difficult to find. In 2021, Intuit exited the program after the IRS stopped letting companies hide their free filing services from search engines.
 
The FTC&#x27;s ALJ determined that there is a &quot;cognizant danger of a recurring violation&quot; by Intuit and issued a cease-and-desist order that prohibits the company from &quot;engaging in deceptive practices in the future.&quot; The ruling prevents Intuit from representing a product as free unless it actually is free for everyone to use and &quot;clearly and conspicuously discloses any terms that would limit the offer.&quot; In a statement, Intuit called the FTC&#x27;s investigation process &quot;flawed and highly questionable,&quot; noting &quot;Intuit already adheres to most of the advertising practices in the FTC&#x27;s erroneous decision.&quot; The company adds that it has &quot;been clear, fair, and transparent&quot; with customers and remains &quot;committed to free tax preparation.&quot;

It&#x27;s available for $20/month in the US or 18 pounds/month in the UK, and it promises five-times-higher usage limits, priority access to Claude during high-traffic periods, and early access to new features as they emerge. Like ChatGPT, Claude Pro can compose text, summarize, do analysis, solve logic puzzles, and more.
 
Claude.ai is what Anthropic offers as its conversational interface for its Claude 2 AI language model, similar to how ChatGPT provides an application wrapper for the underlying models GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. In February, OpenAI chose a subscripti…</span>

                              <span>Microsoft is teaming up with digital pathology provider Paige to build the world&#x27;s largest image-based artificial intelligence model for identifying cancer. From a report: The AI model is training on an unprecedented amount of data that includes billions of images, according to a release. It can identify both common cancers and rare cancers that are notoriously difficult to diagnose, and researchers hope it will eventually help doctors who are struggling to contend with staffing shortages and growing caseloads. Paige develops digital and AI-powered solutions for pathologists, which are doctors who carry out lab tests on bodily fluids and tissues to make a diagnosis. It&#x27;s a specialty that often operates behind the scenes, and it&#x27;s crucial for determining a patient&#x27;s path forward. 

&quot;You don&#x27;t have cancer until the pathologist says so. That&#x27;s the critical step in the whole medical edifice,&quot; Thomas Fuchs, co-founder and chief scientist at Paige, told CNBC in an interview. But despite pathologists&#x27; essential role in medicine, Fuchs said their workflow has not changed much in the last 150 years. To diagnose cancer, for instance, pathologists usually examine a piece of tissue on a glass slide under a microscope. The method is tried and true, but if pathologists miss something, it can have dire consequences for patients.

From a report: The federal government has announced it is taking statutory declarations into the digital age, saying it will accept electronic signatures and video link witnessing from next year. It makes permanent a change introduced during the pandemic, when attending a justice of the peace (JP) for a statutory declaration -- a practice that goes back to the 19th century -- was forbidden under lockdown restrictions. 

Legislation introduced this week by the federal attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, will also allow people to digitally execute a statutory declaration using the online platform myGov and the myGovID Digital ID. Dreyfus says the bill is intended to keep with the changing ways of Australians. &quot;This bill will respond to how Australians want and expect to engage and communicate digitally with government by providing options to make commonwealth statutory declarations facilitated by technology,&quot; he says. &quot;This bill is an important milestone in driving the digitisation of government services.&quot;

                              <span>Apple might be the king of tech. But in the growing cold economic war between the world&#x27;s two biggest economies, it is becoming just another game piece -- albeit a big one. WSJ: Still the world&#x27;s largest public company by market value, Apple has seen that value take a notable hit this week on increasing signs that its business in China might be coming under threat. The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that the Chinese government is banning the iPhone and other foreign-branded devices from use by workers at central government agencies. Bloomberg reported Thursday that such a ban might also be extended to state-owned enterprises and other government-backed entities. That could amount to a significant swath of people in a state-led economy with a population totaling more than 1.4 billion. 

According to China&#x27;s National Bureau of Statistics, about 56.3 million urban workers were employed by &quot;state-owned units&quot; in 2021. Those jobs commanded an average wage about 8% above the national urban average -- an attractive segment for a company specializing in premium devices. And because Apple now ships roughly 230 million iPhones globally every year, 56 million would be a notable chunk to take out of the pool of potential buyers -- especially in a mature global smartphone market with low growth prospects. [...] Apple&#x27;s stock price has thus slumped nearly 7% over the past two days, costing the company about $194 billion in market value. That might seem excessive considering the many unknowns about the reported iPhone bans and how they could ultimately play out. Also, China has at least some interest in not overly harming a major local employer during a time of growing unemployment. One Chinese city alone reportedly has more than one million workers building Apple products or employed in related jobs.

                              <span>Governments are failing to cut greenhouse gas emissions fast enough to meet the goals of the Paris agreement and to stave off climate disaster, a major report by the UN has found. From a report: Meeting the goals will require &quot;phasing out all unabated fossil fuels,&quot; the report says, in an acknowledgment that some oil-producing countries may find hard to take. The need to phase out fossil fuels has not been explicitly adopted by the UN before, under successive rounds of climate talks, and language over &quot;phasing out&quot; or &quot;phasing down&quot; fossil fuels has caused controversy at the annual UN climate talks. 

There is a &quot;rapidly narrowing window&quot; for governments to move faster, according to the report, as global greenhouse gas emissions must peak by 2025 at the latest, and be rapidly reduced from there, to limit temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Emissions are still rising, however, and there is a gap of 20 to 23 gigatonnes of CO2 between the cuts needed by 2030 to limit global temperatures to 1.5C and the world&#x27;s current emissions trajectory. The report, which was expected next week but was published hurriedly in draft by the UN on Friday, will form the basis of the first &quot;global stocktake&quot; under the 2015 Paris agreement. That process is meant to track countries&#x27; efforts to meet the goals of the treaty.

                              <span>New York law enforcement agencies have spent millions of dollars to expand their capabilities to track and analyze social media posts, new documents show, including by contracting with a surveillance firm accused of improperly scraping social media platforms for data. From a report: Documents obtained by the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (Stop), a privacy advocacy non-profit and shared with the Guardian, reveal the New York police department in 2018 entered a nearly $9m contract with Voyager Labs, a surveillance company that has been sued by Meta for allegedly using nearly 40,000 fake Facebook accounts to collect data on an estimated 600,000 users. NYPD purchased Voyager Labs products that the company claims can use artificial intelligence to analyze online human behavior and detect and predict fraud and crimes, the documents show. 

A separate document reveals a contract between the Queens district attorney and Israeli firm Cobwebs Technologies, which also offers social network mapping products, as well as tools to track location information through phones. It&#x27;s unclear how much that contract is worth. Law enforcement across the United States have worked with social media analytics companies for years, hoping to more effectively and efficiently collect and make sense of the hordes of personal information available on the internet. But experts have argued the practice can cross ethical and legal lines, particularly when used to access private information, make inferences or predict future criminality based on the content posted on social media, or otherwise help law enforcement skip obtaining subpoenas and warrants before gathering information on someone.

                              <span>Researchers at digital watchdog group Citizen Lab say they found spyware they linked to Israeli firm NSO that exploited a newly discovered flaw in Apple devices. From a report: While inspecting the Apple device of an employee of a Washington-based civil society group last week, Citizen Lab said it found the flaw had been used to infect the device with NSO&#x27;s Pegasus spyware, it said in a statement. 

Bill Marczak, senior researcher at Citizen Lab, said the attacker likely made a mistake during the installation which is how Citizen Lab found the spyware. Citizen Lab said Apple confirmed to them that using the high security feature &quot;Lockdown Mode&quot; available on Apple devices blocks this particular attack. The flaw allowed compromise of iPhones running the latest version of iOS (16.6) without any interaction from the victim, the digital watchdog said. The new update fixes this vulnerability.

                              <span>The Internal Revenue Service has started using artificial intelligence to investigate tax evasion at multibillion-dollar partnerships as it looks for ways to better police hedge funds, private equity groups, real estate investors and large law firms. From a report: The announcement on Friday demonstrated how a more muscular I.R.S. is using some of the $80 billion allocated through last year&#x27;s Inflation Reduction Act to target the wealthiest Americans and tackle the kinds of cases that had become too complex and cumbersome for the beleaguered agency to handle. The agency&#x27;s new funding is intended to help the I.R.S. raise more federal revenue by cracking down on tax cheats and others who use sophisticated accounting maneuvers to avoid paying what they owe. But the allocation has been politically contentious, with Republicans claiming that the I.R.S. will use the funding to harass small businesses and middle-class taxpayers. 

Earlier this year, Republicans succeeded in clawing back $20 billion as part of an agreement to raise the nation&#x27;s borrowing cap. That political fight has put the onus on Democrats and the Biden administration to show that the funding is primarily enabling the I.R.S. to target the rich. &quot;These are complex cases for I.R.S. teams to unpack,&quot; Daniel Werfel, the I.R.S. commissioner, said in a briefing with reporters. &quot;The I.R.S. has simply not had enough resources or staffing to address partnerships; in a real sense, we&#x27;ve been overwhelmed in this area for years.&quot;

                              <span>A special commission within Poland&#x27;s Senate concluded that the government&#x27;s use of spyware, like the one made by NSO Group, is illegal. From a report: The commission announced on Thursday the conclusion of its 18-month-long investigation into allegations that the Polish government used NSO&#x27;s spyware, known as Pegasus, to spy on an opposition politician and other politicians around the time of the country&#x27;s 2019 elections. &quot;Pegasus cannot be used under Polish law,&quot; the report read, according to a machine translation. &quot;This is because the Polish legal system does not allow the use of programs in which acquired operational data is transferred through transmission channels uncontrolled by the relevant services, as this creates the risk of violating its integrity and does not ensure its confidentiality, as required by law.&quot; 

In other words, NSO&#x27;s spyware is not designed in a way that respects Polish law, collects too much information, and cannot guarantee that that information is secured properly, according to the report. The commission also concluded that the Polish government used Pegasus to retaliate against opposition figures, and that these surveillance operations negatively influenced the 2019 elections in the country. The commission compared these abuses with Russian government hackers activities in the 2016 elections in the United States.

                              <span>Siddharth Vikram Philip, Sabah Meddings, and Supriya Singh, reporting for Bloomberg News: As chief commercial officer of aircraft-parts supplier AOG Technics, Ray Kwong can look back on a well-rounded career at A-list companies including All Nippon Airways, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Nissan Motor. That, at least, is Kwong&#x27;s two-decade corporate journey on what appears to be his LinkedIn profile, from which the self-proclaimed executive beams with a broad smile and striped tie in blue hues. Trouble is that -- much like the company for which Kwong now claims to work -- not all is as it seems. Kwong, if he even exists, was never employed at Nissan, or at ANA for that matter. Neither company has records of him as a former worker, they said in response to queries by Bloomberg News. His employment history could also not be verified at Mitsubishi. What is used as his profile picture turns out to be a stock photo that&#x27;s also washed up elsewhere on the Internet, from promotional material for a German textile startup to a clinic in Northbrook, Illinois. 

After Bloomberg reported on the case of bogus jet-engine repair parts being investigated by regulators, a deeper dive into AOG revealed that the fabrication not only concerned components, but extended to major aspects of the company behind the scandal. The proliferation of undocumented parts has sent shock waves through an industry where every component requires verification to ensure aircraft safety, leaving manufacturers, operators and authorities scrambling to determine the fallout. The parts supplied by AOG went into engines that power many older-generation Airbus SE A320 and Boeing 737 planes, by far the most widely flown category of commercial aircraft. These single-aisle jets are used by millions of passengers each day and by most airlines, mainly on short-haul flights. Airbus said it&#x27;s aware of media reports surrounding AOG, while Boeing said it will defer to regulators on the topic.

From there, Paint will automatically detect the subject of an image and cut away the background. Microsoft notes that you can also manually select the portion of the background that you want to remove.

                              <span>Clubhouse, the invite-only social audio app that went viral during the pandemic, is trying to make a comeback by rebranding itself as a better alternative for group texting. Engadget reports: The audio app is pivoting from its signature &quot;drop-in&quot; audio conversations to friend-centric voice chats, the company said in an update. Instead of sprawling rooms where users host live-streamed conversations open to any and all of the app&#x27;s users, the new Clubhouse will instead encourage users to join groups with people they know.
 
The groups are, somewhat confusingly, called &quot;chats,&quot; and allow friends and friends-of-friends to exchange voice messages. There&#x27;s still a &quot;drop-in&quot; element, but it&#x27;s less focused on real-time talking and geared more toward something like an Instagram Story -- a destination for checking in and sharing quick updates. The app is also ditching text-based direct messages in favor of private audio messages which, yes, it&#x27;s calling voicemails or VMs.
 
The biggest shift, however, isn&#x27;t just the format of the conversations but that Clubhouse is now positioning itself as more of a Snapchat, where smaller groups of friends communicate privately or semi-privately, than a Twitter, where all the app&#x27;s users are shouting into the void. &quot;It&#x27;s not about passively listening to people speaking,&quot; the company wrote in an update. &quot;You can listen to great conversations on podcasts, YouTube, TikTok, and a lot of other platforms. It&#x27;s about talking with people ... and becoming real-life friends with your friends&#x27; friends, and people you never would have met otherwise.&quot;

                              <span>I&#x27;m often asked how you know if an idea — product, business, or otherwise — is good. Good enough to pursue. Good enough to follow. Good enough to invest in. Good enough to get behind.


You don&#x27;t know. You feel. You give into your intuition, you tune into your senses, you notice goosebumps. What does it feel like? What&#x27;s the vibe of this thing? That&#x27;s what I want to know. 


Good ideas are like slipstreams — they have their own effortless, accelerated pull. They slide rather than grind. They have a smooth, silky texture — like a perfect milkshake being drawn through a wide straw. Everything has a nature, and good ideas have theirs.


Feeling like you&#x27;re on to something is an unmistakable feeling. Don&#x27;t look for it, don&#x27;t ask about it, don&#x27;t fish for opinions. Feel for it.

                              <span>After almost four years leading the Rust Infrastructure Team, in late July I
expressed my intent to step down as lead of the team to focus back on
technical work. On one side, I need to rest and recharge after doing
organizational and governance work for so long. On the other side, it&#x27;s healthy
for the team to rotate its leadership role to bring fresh ideas to the table!
Like the other Rust teams, the lead in the infra team is not who makes the
final decision, and their vote doesn&#x27;t have more weight. We make all decisions
together, and the lead is mostly responsible for running meetings, making sure
important tasks are not dropped on the floor, and representing the team with
third parties.
The whole team met this week to discuss our future. We decided that we want to
take inspiration from the compiler team&#x27;s rolling leads: we will
have two leads at the same time, with the expectation that after a number of
years (still to be defined) the one who served the most time as lead will step
down, making space for a new lead. We will also document our process in the
coming months.
We also have consensus on the two new leads of the team! I&#x27;m happy to announce
that for the next few years, the new team leads for infra will be:
Jake Goulding (@shepmaster), long time member of the infra team. He
maintains the Rust Playground, and has been instrumental in the
support for Apple Silicon in our CI.
Jan David Nose (@jdno), who joined the Rust Foundation last year to work
full-time inside the infrastructure team, bringing a lot of experience and
time.
On behalf of the team I want to thank them for stepping up, and we all wish
them best of luck in their new role!
As for myself, I&#x27;m proud of the work the whole team has been doing over the
past four years and all the challenges we overcame. It&#x27;s been an honor serving
as the lead and I look forward to going back to technical work in the coming
months.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Gizmodo: Google&#x27;s Privacy Sandbox, a controversial set of tools and settings meant to replace third-party cookies, is now on almost every single Chrome browser, according to a company blog post published Thursday. Google says Privacy Sandbox is now available to around 97% of Chrome users, and that number will reach 100% in the next few months. The news comes on the heels of the browser&#x27;s 15th anniversary, which Google is celebrating by redesigning Chrome to make it look and feel more closely aligned with the design paradigm of Android and the rest of the Google suite. The final step in this process comes in 2024, when Google will disable third-party cookies in Chrome for good, marking the end of their decades-long reign of privacy-violating terror.

                              <span>Morgan Stanley is rolling out a generative AI chatbot this month to help bankers quickly find research or forms without needing to sift through hundreds of thousands of documents. According to Reuters, it&#x27;s being developed with OpenAI. From the report: The bank is also developing technology which eventually, with clients&#x27; permission, could create a meeting summary of the conversation, draft a follow-up email suggesting next steps, update the bank&#x27;s sales database, schedule a follow-up appointment, and learn how to help advisers manage clients&#x27; finances on areas such as taxes, retirement savings and inheritances. The details of the program have not yet been reported.
 
While the bot will give insights and administrative support to financial advisers, investment advice will remain the purview of humans. &quot;The adviser is still at the center,&quot; said [Sal Cucchiara, Morgan Stanley&#x27;s chief information officer of wealth and investment management, who is among the executives driving the bank&#x27;s push into AI]. For now, employees view the technology as a helpful tool and aren&#x27;t worried that they&#x27;ll be replaced by bots, he said. The AI initiative is part of Morgan Stanley&#x27;s strategy to drive its wealth division, where net revenue surged 16% to a record in the second quarter and new client assets grew $90 billion.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from CNBC: Chinese state-aligned influence and disinformation campaigns are impersonating U.S. voters and targeting political candidates on multiple social media platforms with improved sophistication, Microsoft said in a threat analysis report Thursday. Chinese Communist Party-affiliated &quot;covert influence operations have now begun to successfully engage with target audiences on social media to a greater extent than previously observed,&quot; according to the report, which focused on the rise in &quot;digital threats from East Asia.&quot; The Microsoft report also cautioned that some Chinese influence campaigns are now using generative artificial intelligence to create visual content that&#x27;s &quot;already drawn higher levels of engagement from authentic&quot; users, a trend the company said began around March.
 
Chinese influence campaigns have historically struggled to gain traction with intended targets, who in this case are U.S. voters and residents. But since the 2022 midterm elections, those efforts have become more effective, Microsoft warned. Microsoft found content from Chinese influence campaigns on multiple apps, including Meta&#x27;s Facebook and Instagram, Microsoft-owned LinkedIn, and X. In August, Facebook parent Meta announced it had disrupted the largest ever identified disinformation campaign and linked it to China state-affiliated actors. Microsoft&#x27;s report included screenshots of two different X posts in April that were identified as CCP-affiliated disinformation. Both were about the Black Lives Matter movement and had the same graphic. The first came from an automated CCP-affiliated account. The second, Microsoft said, was uploaded by an account impersonating a conservative U.S. voter seven hours later.

                              <span>Ruby on Rails creator David Heinemeier Hansson has removed TypeScript from the forthcoming version 8 of the Turbo framework, saying he has &quot;never been a fan,&quot; but many Turbo users have protested that the decision was rushed and the change is unwelcome. From a report: A comment on the GitHub pull request that removes TypeScript states that this &quot;is a step back, for both library users and contributors.&quot; This comment has -- at the time of writing -- 357 likes and just 8 downvotes, suggesting wide support. Turbo is a framework for delivering HTML pages intended to &quot;dramatically reduce the amount of custom JavaScript,&quot; and is sponsored by Hannson&#x27;s company 37signals, whose products include the Basecamp project management platform and the Hey messaging system. Turbo is the engine of Hotwire, short for &quot;HTML over the wire,&quot; because it prefers sending HTML itself rather than JSON data and JavaScript code. 

Although Turbo itself is not among the most popular frameworks, Ruby on Rails is well-known and used by major web sites including GitHub and Shopify. Hansson posted that TypeScript &quot;pollutes the code with type gymnastics that add ever so little joy to my development experience, and quite frequently considerable grief. Things that should be easy become hard.&quot; The community around the open source Turbo project though is for the most part perplexed and disappointed, not only by the change itself, but also by the manner in which it was made.

                              <span>OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT, the wildly popular artificial intelligence chatbot launched in November, saw monthly website visits decline for the third month in a row in August, though there are signs the decline is coming to an end, according to analytics firm Similarweb. Reuters: Worldwide desktop and mobile website visits to the ChatGPT website decreased by 3.2% to 1.43 billion in August, following approximately 10% drops from each of the previous two months. The amount of time visitors spent on the website has also been declining monthly since March, from an average of 8.7 minutes on site to 7 minutes on site in August. But August worldwide unique visitors ticked up to 180.5 million users from 180 million. 

School coming back into session in September may help ChatGPT&#x27;s traffic and usage, and some schools have begun to embrace it. U.S. ChatGPT traffic in August rose slightly, in concert with American schools being back in session. &quot;Students seeking homework help appears to be part of the story: the percentage of younger users of the website dropped over the summer and is now starting to bounce back,&quot; said David F. Carr of Similarweb, who regularly tracks ChatGPT and its competitors.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Artificial intelligence, according to Nicolai Tangen, head of Norway&#x27;s huge $1.4tn oil fund, is like being &quot;in a rocket on the way into space ... It&#x27;s hugely exciting, but it&#x27;s also scary.&quot; Stretching the metaphor to its limits, the head of the world&#x27;s largest sovereign wealth fund adds: &quot;We hope we&#x27;re in Apollo 11, not Challenger. The mission statement is to return safely.&quot; All this might just seem to be a glib soundbite, but the Norwegian fund is among the most advanced of any of the world&#x27;s big traditional investors in publicly articulating its thoughts on AI. This is not just on the balance between risk and opportunity from AI but also what it thinks the companies it invests in should be doing. As the importance of AI only grows, the oil fund&#x27;s stance is going to be well worth following. 

[...] The first is ensuring boards are accountable for the responsible development and use of AI. Here, Tangen is damning. &quot;Boards are absolutely not on top of this,&quot; he says. Given how many companies have long struggled to get enough expertise on cyber security, AI is likely to be an even tougher ask. The oil fund could vote against those that do nothing, Tangen adds. The second relates to how transparent companies are on how they use AI and how they explain how those systems have been designed and tested. As well as the tech industry itself, the fund is paying particular attention to those sectors using AI with consumers such as healthcare, financial and consumer goods. The final element is risk management. The fund argues that companies should be proactive, and ensure outside verification and auditing of their AI systems and risk management processes.

                              <span>The U.S. Senate today approved a nominee to fill the vacant, fifth seat on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The Senate voted 55 to 43 to approve Anna Gomez as the fifth FCC Commissioner. Her term will be for five years from July 1, 2021, so effectively about three years. From a report: Gomez most recently has served as a senior advisor on communications policy at the Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy. She was also deputy administrator at the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) from 2009 to 2013. The NTIA is not only important as the advisor to the President on national spectrum policy, but the agency is also currently overseeing the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment (BEAD) program.

                              <span>Microsoft says it will defend buyers of its artificial intelligence products from copyright infringement lawsuits, an effort by the software giant to ease concerns customers might have about using its AI &quot;Copilots&quot; to generate content based on existing work. From a report: The Microsoft Copilot Copyright Commitment will protect customers as long as they&#x27;ve &quot;used the guardrails and content filters we have built into our products&quot; Hossein Nowbar, General Counsel, Corporate Legal Affairs and Corporate Secretary at Microsoft, said in a blog post Thursday. Microsoft also pledged to pay related fines or settlements and said it has taken steps to ensure its Copilots respect copyright. 

&quot;We believe in standing behind our customers when they use our products,&quot; Nowbar said. &quot;We are charging our commercial customers for our Copilots, and if their use creates legal issues, we should make this our problem rather than our customers&#x27; problem.&quot; Generative AI applications scoop up existing content such as art, articles and programming code and use it to generate new material that can simplify or automate a range of tasks. Microsoft is baking the technology, developed with partner OpenAI, into many of its biggest products, including Office and Windows, potentially putting customers in legal jeopardy.

                              <span>Google is killing off the last vestiges of Google Play Movies &amp; TV, a service that sold premium Hollywood films and TV shows as part of Google&#x27;s once-cohesive string of Google Play content stores. From a report: The company emailed users of Android TV to say that the &quot;Google Play Movies &amp; TV app will no longer be available on your Android TV device from 05 October 2023. You can continue to buy or rent movies directly through the Shop tab on your Android TV.&quot; Play Movies has been going through a slow death as Google shuffles around its media content. The smartphone Play Movies app became &quot;Google TV&quot; in 2022, and that same year, the Play Store app was stripped of movie and TV sales. 

On third-party smart TVs (this is a different category than today&#x27;s Android TV announcement) the app was killed in 2021. On Android TV, the new &quot;Shop&quot; tab seems to just be an OS-integrated Google TV content store. If you think this sounds confusing, you&#x27;re not alone. Google&#x27;s support page reflects the ridiculous state of Google&#x27;s video apps, instructing users that &quot;in Your Library, you can find content that you bought from: Google Play Movies &amp; TV, YouTube, Android TV, Google TV.&quot; How any normal person is supposed to understand that pile of Google media brands, and how it works across phones, the web, and various smart TV OSes, is beyond me.

                              <span>A new report says that a PR firm has been paying Rotten Tomatoes critics for positive reviews for over five years. From a report: Moviegoers, critics, and the average internet user have all used the aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes at one point or another. The website categorizes films and shows from &quot;fresh&quot; to &quot;rotten,&quot; with rotten being those with lower ratings. Now it looks like the site&#x27;s scores have been manipulated for more than five years. As noted by Vulture, it looks like a PR firm has manipulated movie scores on Rotten Tomatoes by paying the critics directly. This has been happening for years. 

The PR firm, named Bunker 15, is said to pay as much as $50.00 for a single Rotten Tomatoes review. The payments, which aren&#x27;t typically disclosed, are usually given to obscure critics who happen to be part of a pool tracked by Rotten Tomatoes. Though it&#x27;s worth noting that the aggregation site&#x27;s rules prohibit &quot;Reviewing based on a financial incentive.&quot; Director Paul Schrader, also a critic, spoke out against Rotten Tomatoes which he says is part of a &quot;broken&quot; system. &quot;The system is broken. Audiences are dumber. Normal people don&#x27;t go through reviews like they used to. Rotten Tomatoes is something the studios can game. So they do.&quot; The site responded by delisting a variety of Bunker 15 films from their website. Furthermore, they issued a warning to any critics that reviewed them. The warning emphasizes that they do not tolerate manipulation on their platform.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: In Cologne last month, Nintendo&#x27;s public Gamescom showfloor booth let you play Pikmin 4 and Super Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. But behind the scenes, the company had more up its sleeves. Developer presentations for Switch 2 took place behind closed doors, Eurogamer understands, with partners shown tech demos of how well the system is designed to run. 

One Switch 2 demo is a souped up version of Switch launch title Zelda: Breath of the Wild, designed to hit the Switch 2&#x27;s beefier target specs. (To be clear, though - this is just a tech demo. There&#x27;s no suggestion the game will be re-released.) Nintendo is yet to publicly discuss plans for its inevitable Switch successor, though its new hardware is widely-expected to launch at some point in 2024. Word that it is now being shown to external developers comes as details have begun to emerge around when we may see the system launch.

                              <span>Birmingham City Council, the largest local authority in Europe, has declared itself in financial distress after troubled Oracle project costs ballooned from $25 million to around $125.5 million. The Register reports: Contributing to the publication of a legal Section 114 Notice, which says the $4.3 billion revenue organization is unable to balance the books, is a bill of up to $954 million to settle equal pay claims. In a statement today, councillors John Cotton and Sharon Thompson, leader and deputy leader respectively, said the authority was also hit by financial stress owing to issues with the implementation of its Oracle IT system. The council has made a request to the Local Government Association for additional strategic support, the statement said.
 
In May, Birmingham City Council said it was set to pay up to $125.5 million for its Oracle ERP system -- potentially a fourfold increase on initial estimated expenses -- in a project suffering from delays, cost over-runs, and a lack of controls. After grappling with the project to replace SAP for core HR and finance functions since 2018, the council reviewed the plan in 2019, 2020, and again in 2021, when the total implementation cost for the project almost doubled to $48.5 million. The project, dubbed Financial and People, was &quot;crucial to an organisation of Birmingham City Council&#x27;s size,&quot; a spokesperson said at the time. Cotton said the system had a problem with how it was &quot;tracking our financial transactions and HR transactions issues as well. That&#x27;s got to be fixed,&quot; he said.
 
Earlier this year, one insider told The Register that Oracle Fusion, the cloud-based ERP system the council is moving to, &quot;is not a product that is suitable for local authorities, because it&#x27;s very much geared towards a manufacturing/trading organization.&quot; They said the previous SAP system had been heavily customized to meet the council&#x27;s needs and it was struggling to recreate these functions in Oracle.

And mostly, I look at people with a passionate preference and smile. Isn&#x27;t it great that people care so much about their craft that they volunteer to extol the benefits of their favorite tools! Yes it is, but there&#x27;s also a fine line between being a passionate evangelist and becoming a dogmatic crusader. And a sad but critical mass of the TypeScript faithful chose the latter in response to our decision to drop their beloved compiler from our project yesterday. It was at times a full-on meltdown. Yuck.

                              <span>In a press release today, the Federal Aviation Administration said UPS delivery drones are now allowed to fly longer distance flights beyond the sight of ground operators. &quot;This is the kind of move that opens the door for drone delivery companies like Wing, FedEx, and Zip to deliver packages across a wider area and service more customers,&quot; reports The Verge. From the report: UPS Flight Forward, a UPS subsidiary focused on drone delivery, can now deliver small packages beyond the visual line of sight (BVLOS) without spotters on the ground monitoring the route and skies for other aircraft, using SwissDrones SVO 50 V2 drones. The FAA also announced authorizations for two other companies to fly beyond sight for commercial purposes. That includes uAvionix Corp. and, last week, infrastructure inspection company Phoenix Air Unmanned.
 
UPS first received government approval to operate its drone service in 2019, the same year the FAA authorized Alphabet&#x27;s Wing service to operate commercially. The company first focused on building a drone delivery network for US hospital campuses.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from BleepingComputer: Toyota says a recent disruption of operations in Japan-based production plants was caused by its database servers running out of storage space. On August 29th, it was reported that Toyota had to halt operations on 12 of its 14 Japan-based car assembly plants due to an undefined system malfunction. As one of the largest automakers in the world, the situation caused production output losses of roughly 13,000 cars daily, threatening to impact exports to the global market.
 
In a statement released today on Toyota&#x27;s Japanese news portal, the company explains that the malfunction occurred during a planned IT systems maintenance event on August 27th, 2023. The planned maintenance was to organize the data and deletion of fragmented data in a database. However, as the storage was filled to capacity before the completion of the tasks, an error occurred, causing the system to shut down. This shutdown directly impacted the company&#x27;s production ordering system so that no production tasks could be planned and executed.
 
Toyota explains that its main servers and backup machines operate on the same system. Due to this, both systems faced the same failure, making a switchover impossible, inevitably leading to a halt in factory operations. The restoration came on August 29th, 2023, when Toyota&#x27;s IT team had prepared a larger capacity server to accept the data that was partially transferred two days back. This allowed Toyota&#x27;s engineers to restore the production ordering system and the plants to resume operations.

                              <span>Apple has been expanding its computing budget for building artificial intelligence to millions of dollars a day. The Information: One of its goals is to develop features such as one that allows iPhone customers to use simple voice commands to automate tasks involving multiple steps, according to people familiar with the effort. The technology, for instance, could allow someone to tell the Siri voice assistant on their phone to create a GIF using the last five photos they&#x27;ve taken and text it to a friend. Today, an iPhone user has to manually program the individual actions. 

The moves come four years after Apple&#x27;s head of AI, John Giannandrea, authorized the formation of a team to develop conversational AI, known as large-language models, before the technology became a focus of the software industry, according to people with knowledge of the team. That move now seems prescient following the launch last fall of ChatGPT, a chatbot that catalyzed a boom in language models. 

Although Giannandrea has repeatedly expressed skepticism to colleagues about the potential usefulness of chatbots powered by AI language models, the fact that Apple wasn&#x27;t completely unprepared for the language model boom could be considered an accomplishment -- and is the result of changes he made to the company&#x27;s software research culture, several colleagues said.

                              <span>The UK&#x27;s worst air-traffic outage in a decade was caused by an anomaly in the airspace manager&#x27;s software system, which confused two geographical checkpoints separated by some 4,000 nautical miles. From a report: The UK&#x27;s Civil Aviation Authority said Wednesday it will conduct an independent review of the incident, which forced hundreds of flights to be canceled or delayed last week after an error in processing an airline&#x27;s flight plan. The glitch triggered a shutdown of the software system run by NATS for safety reasons, according to a preliminary report from the public-private partnership formerly called National Air Traffic Services. This forced air-traffic staff to input flight plans manually, drastically reducing the amount of air traffic that could be processed. 

The event sent airlines and airports in the UK into turmoil on Aug. 28, leaving planes out of position and passengers stranded. Nearly 800 flights leaving UK airports were canceled, with a similar number of arrivals scrapped, according to analytics firm Cirium. The report by NATS showed that on the day of the incident, an airline entered a plan into the system which led through UK airspace. NATS Chief Executive Officer Martin Rolfe declined to discuss details of the flight, such as its route or the airline involved, saying the specifics weren&#x27;t pertinent to the outage. While the flight plan wasn&#x27;t faulty, it threw off the system because the software used by NATS received duplicate identities for two different points on the map. There are an infinite number of flight-plan waypoints in the world, and duplicates remain despite work to remove them, according to Rolfe.

                              <span>tlhIngan writes: Starfield, a Bethesda space-based RPG that was recently released, was criticized for not having Nvidia DLSS support -- instead the game was primarily written to feature AMD&#x27;s FSR support. This isn&#x27;t too surprising since the major consoles all use AMD processors and GPUs. However, an enterprising modder created a mod that enables players with Nvidia cards to enable DLSS. This isn&#x27;t the unusual bit -- the mod makes DLSS2 (ca. 2020) available for free, while the version enabling DLSS3 (which adds the ability to use AI to generate frames in-between) is behind a Patreon paywall. This has lead to several other people to crack the DRM protecting the mod itself (note: this is not the DRM on the game itself -- the game&#x27;s Steam page doesn&#x27;t seem to imply use of 3rd party DRM beyond Steam). Imagine that -- DRM on a game mod because it requires payment.

                              <span>YouTube is trying out games as its next experimental offering. The company is adding a new &quot;Playables&quot; section on the site that will include games that can be played on both the desktop website and mobile devices. From a report: Playables will only appear for &quot;a limited number of users to start,&quot; and there was no list of game titles published at this time. 9to5Google reports that one of the games to grace the new YouTube Playables experiment includes Stack Bounce, which involves a 3D ball bouncing on top of rings you must smash through with well-timed clicks. If you&#x27;ve heard of the game before, it&#x27;s because Google already offers it on its minigames service, GameSnacks.

                              <span>Roku will cut more than 300 staffers -- laying off 10% of its workforce -- as the streaming-platform company continues its battle to control costs. From a report: In addition, Roku will remove certain licensed and owned content from its platform as part of a &quot;strategic review of its content portfolio,&quot; resulting in an impairment charge of up to $65 million in the current quarter, the company disclosed in an SEC filing Wednesday. Other cost-cutting measures Roku outlined are consolidating office space and reducing outside services expenses. 

The goal is to reduce year-over-year operating expense growth rate, the company said. The layoffs represent Roku&#x27;s third round of job cuts in less than a year, after it pink-slipped 200 staffers in November 2022 and another 200 in March 2023. As of the end of 2022, Roku had approximately 3,600 full-time employees. The company, in addition to the layoffs, said it also plans to cut back on new hires.

                              <span>Slash_Account_Dot writes: An artificial intelligence company, whose founder Forbes included in a 30 Under 30 list recently, promises to use machine learning to convert clients&#x27; 2D illustrations into 3D models. In reality the company, called Kaedim, uses human artists for &#x27;quality control.&#x27; According to two sources with knowledge of the process interviewed by 404 Media, at one point, Kaedim often used human artists to make the models. One of the sources said workers at one point produced the 3D design wholecloth themselves without the help of machine learning at all. 

The news pulls back the curtain on a hyped startup and is an example of how AI companies can sometimes overstate the capabilities of their technology. Like other AI startups, Kaedim wants to use AI to do tedious labor that is currently being done by humans. In this case, 3D modeling, a time consuming job that video game companies are already outsourcing to studios in countries like China.

                              <span>The Pentagon is considering the development of a vast network of AI-powered technology, drones and autonomous systems within the next two years to counter threats from China and other adversaries. WSJ: Kathleen Hicks, the deputy secretary of defense, will provide new details in a speech later Wednesday about the department&#x27;s plans to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to develop an array of thousands of air-, land- and sea-based artificial-intelligence systems that are intended to be &quot;small, smart, cheap.&quot; 

The U.S. is seeking to keep pace with China&#x27;s rapidly expanding military amid concerns that the Pentagon bureaucracy takes too long to develop and deploy cutting-edge systems. [...] One approach could be to build on the capabilities demonstrated by Task Force 59, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s network of drones and sensors designed to monitor Iran&#x27;s military activities in the Middle East.

                              <span>The UK government will concede it will not use controversial powers in the online safety bill to scan messaging apps for harmful content until it is &quot;technically feasible&quot; to do so, postponing measures that critics say threaten users&#x27; privacy. Financial Times: A planned statement to the House of Lords on Wednesday afternoon will mark an eleventh-hour bid by ministers to end a stand-off with tech companies, including WhatsApp, that have threatened to pull their services from the UK over what they claimed was an intolerable threat to millions of users&#x27; security. The statement is set to outline that Ofcom, the tech regulator, will only require companies to scan their networks when a technology is developed that is capable of doing so, according to people briefed on the plan. Many security experts believe it could be years before any such technology is developed, if ever. 

&quot;A notice can only be issued where technically feasible and where technology has been accredited as meeting minimum standards of accuracy in detecting only child sexual abuse and exploitation content,&quot; the statement will say. The online safety bill, which has been in development for several years and is now in its final stages in parliament, is one of the toughest attempts by any government to make Big Tech companies responsible for the content that is shared on their networks.

                              <span>schwit1 writes: The Justice Department has spent three years over two presidential administrations building the case that Google illegally abused its power over online search to throttle competition. To defend itself, Google has enlisted hundreds of employees and three powerful law firms and spent millions of dollars on legal fees and lobbyists. On Tuesday, a judge in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia will begin considering their arguments at a trial that cuts to the heart of a long-simmering question: Did today&#x27;s tech giants become dominant by breaking the law? 

The case -- U.S. et al v. Google -- is the federal government&#x27;s first monopoly trial of the modern internet era, as a generation of tech companies has come to wield immense influence over commerce, information, public discourse, entertainment and labor. The trial moves the antitrust battle against those companies to a new phase, shifting from challenging their mergers and acquisitions to more deeply examining the businesses that thrust them into power. Such a consequential case over tech power has not unfolded since the Justice Department took Microsoft to court in 1998 for antitrust violations.

                              <span>By all accounts, TypeScript has been a big success for Microsoft. I&#x27;ve seen loads of people sparkle with joy from dousing JavaScript with explicit types that can be checked by a compiler. But I&#x27;ve never been a fan. Not after giving it five minutes, not after giving it five years. So it&#x27;s with great pleasure that I can announce we&#x27;re dropping TypeScript from the next big release of Turbo 8.
The fact is that I actually rather like JavaScript. I&#x27;d go so far as to say it&#x27;s my second favorite language after Ruby. Yes, a distant second, but a second none the less. This wasn&#x27;t always the case. But after we got proper classes in JavaScript, and all the other improvements that flowed since ES6, it&#x27;s become a real joy to write.
I still don&#x27;t think JavaScript is well-suited for most of the work we do…</span>

                              <span>According to Arm&#x27;s IPO documents, Apple has signed a new deal with the chipmaker for technology that &quot;extends beyond 2040.&quot; Reuters reports: Arm unveiled pricing on Tuesday for what it hopes will be a $52 billion initial public offering, which would be the largest such deal in the U.S. this year. Arm owner SoftBank plans to offer 95.5 million American depository shares of the United Kingdom-based company for $47 to $51 apiece, Arm said in a filing. Arm owns the intellectual property behind the computing architecture for most of the world&#x27;s smartphones, which it licenses to Apple and many others. Apple uses Arm&#x27;s technology in the processes of designing its own custom chips for its iPhones, iPads and Macs.
 
The two companies have a long history -- Apple was one of the initial companies that partnered to found the firm in 1990, before the release of its &quot;Newton&quot; handheld computer in 1993, which used an Arm-based processor chip. The Newton flopped, but Arm went on to become dominant in mobile phone chips because of its low power consumption, which helps batteries last longer. The deal disclosed on Tuesday was not mentioned in Arm&#x27;s previous IPO filing documents made public on Aug. 21, implying that the deal was signed between then and Sept. 5.

                              <span>Starting in December, Facebook users in the U.K., France and Germany will no longer see a dedicated section for news articles. CNBC reports: Meta said Tuesday that it is plans to &quot;deprecate&quot; the Facebook News tab in early December for users in those European countries as &quot;part of an ongoing effort to better align our investments to our products and services people value the most.&quot; The company added that it plans to spend more time and money on short-form video, as best exemplified by its TikTok-like Reels product.
 
News represents less than 3% of what people see in their Facebook feeds, Meta said. Meta said it would honor the Facebook News obligations it had made to publishers in those countries, but said it won&#x27;t enter into new deals and has no plans to offer new products for news publishers. In June, Meta removed all news content from Facebook and Instagram for users in Canada, following the passage of a bill requiring big tech companies to compensate news businesses when their content is made available on their services.

Now operating as a 501(c)(3) non-profit, the Museum of Classic Chicago Television has called YouTube home since 2007. However, copyright notices sent on behalf of Sony, protecting TV shows between 40 and 60 years old, could shut down the project in 48 hours. &quot;Our YouTube channel with 150k subscribers is in danger of being terminated by September 6th if I don&#x27;t find a way to resolve these copyright claims that Markscan made,&quot; Klein told TorrentFreak on Friday. &quot;At this point, I don&#x27;t even care if they were issued under authorization by Sony or not -- I just need to reach a live human being to try to resolve this without co…</span>

                              <span>Long-time Slashdot reader Mr_Blank shares a report from Axios: AI experts at leading universities favor creating a federal &quot;Department of AI&quot; or a global regulator to govern artificial intelligence over leaving that to Congress, the White House or the private sector. That&#x27;s the top-level finding of the new Axios-Generation Lab-Syracuse University AI Experts Survey of computer science professors from top U.S. research universities. The survey includes responses from 213 professors of computer science at 65 of the top 100 U.S. computer science programs, as defined by SCImago Journal rankings.
 
The survey found experts split over when or if AI will escape human control -- but unified in a view that the emerging technologies must be regulated. &quot;Regulation&quot; was the top response when asked what action would move AI in a positive direction. Just 1 in 6 said AI shouldn&#x27;t or can&#x27;t be regulated. Only a handful trust the private sector to self-regulate. About 1 in 5 predicted AI will &quot;definitely&quot; stay in human control. The rest were split between those saying AI will &quot;probably&quot; or &quot;definitely&quot; get out of human control and those saying &quot;probably not.&quot; &quot;No one individual is highly trusted to deal with AI issues,&quot; adds Axios. &quot;President Biden took the top spot, with 9% of respondents -- slightly higher than Sundar Pichai, Elon Musk or Sam Altman. Mark Zuckerberg and Donald Trump drew 2% and 1%, respectively.&quot;

                              <span>Apple will acquire the major Swedish classical music record label BIS Records, intending to fold it into Apple Music Classical and Platoon. MacRumors reports: BIS Records was founded in 1973 by Robert von Bahr. The label focuses on a range of classical music, with particular focus on works that are not well represented by existing recordings. It is an award-winning name in the world of classical music, acclaimed for its vast catalog and impressive audio quality. The label celebrates its 50th anniversary this week. The company announced its impending acquisition by Apple earlier today.
 
BIS is set to become a part of Apple Music Classical and the Apple-owned label Platoon. Apple acquired Platoon, a London-based A&amp;R startup focused on discovering rising music artists, in 2018. In 2021, Apple announced that it had purchased the classical music streaming service Primephonic and would be folding it into Apple Music via a new app dedicated to the genre. Apple released the Apple Music Classical app in March. The app offers a simpler interface for interacting with classical music specifically. Unlike the main Apple Music app, Apple Music Classical allows users to search by composer, work, conductor, catalog number, and more. Users can get more detailed information from editorial notes and descriptions.

Intel today said that it would provide foundry services and 300mm manufacturing capacity to Tower. As part of the deal, Tower would use Intel&#x27;s plant in New Mexico, operated by Intel Foundry Services (IFS), investing up to $300 million to &quot;acquire and own equipment and other fixed assets&quot; that would be installed in the manufacturing facility.
 
The deal will give Tower a new capacity corridor, it said, of &quot;over 600,000 photo layers per month&quot; to meet expected demand for 300mm chips. The deal will mean that Intel will be manufacturing Tower&#x27;s 65-nanometer pow…</span>

The new goal will be to scan 75 percent of all passengers, the email adds. The news signals CBP&#x27;s increasing focus on biometric, and in particular facial recognition, systems at airports. Although it is unclear if related to the shift in goals, one traveler was also recently told by airline industry staff &quot;CBP said everyone has to do it&quot; when they asked to opt-out of facial recognition while boarding for an international flight last month.

                              <span>Israel&#x27;s prime minister on Sunday floated the idea of building infrastructure projects such as a fiber optic cable linking countries in Asia and the Arabian Peninsula with Europe through Israel and Cyprus. From a report: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he&#x27;s &quot;quite confident&quot; such an infrastructure &quot;corridor&quot; linking Asia to Europe through Israel and Cyprus is feasible. He said such projects could happen if Israel normalizes relations with other countries in the region. The 2020 U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords normalized relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, and the Biden administration is trying to establish official ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia. 

&quot;An example and the most obvious one is a fiber optic connection. That&#x27;s the shortest route. It&#x27;s the safest route. It&#x27;s the most economic route,&quot; Netanyahu said after talks with Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides. The Israeli leader&#x27;s pitch is itself an extension of proposed energy links with Cyprus and Greece as part of growing collaboration on energy in the wake of discoveries of significant natural gas deposits in the economic zones of both Israel and Cyprus.

                              <span>One million lorries of sand a day are being extracted from the world&#x27;s oceans, posing a &quot;significant&quot; threat to marine life and coastal communities facing rising sea levels and storms, according to the first-ever global data platform to monitor the industry. From a report: The new data platform, developed by the UN Environment Programme (Unep), tracks and monitors dredging of sand in the marine environment by using the AIS (automatic identification systems) data from ships. Using data from 2012-19, Marine Sand Watch estimates the dredging industry is digging up 6bn tonnes of marine sand a year, a scale described as &quot;alarming.&quot; The rate of extraction is growing globally, Unep said, and is approaching the natural rate of replenishment of 10bn to 16bn tonnes of sand flowing into the sea from rivers and needed to maintain coastal structure and ecosystems. 

The platform has identified &quot;hotspots&quot; including the North Sea, south-east Asia and the east coast of the United States as areas of concern. In many places where extraction is more intense, including parts of Asia, marine sand is being extracted well beyond the rate at which it is being replenished from rivers. [...] Developed by GRID-Geneva, a centre for analytics within Unep, Marine Sand Watch has trained artificial intelligence to identify the movement of dredging vessels from its AIS data. It has data from 2012-19 from Global Fishing Watch, a company set up to track commercial fishing activities using AIS data from fishing vessels, but is working on more recent data.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Meta Platforms&#x27; releases of its large-language models, Llama and Llama 2, in the past six months have won the company praise for offering free, open-source alternatives to models from OpenAI and Anthropic. But for some of the scientists and engineers who worked on Llama, that praise was too little, too late. Many have quit, embittered by a previously unreported internal battle over computing resources with another Meta research team working on a rival model that the company ultimately abandoned, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. 

Their departures are a reminder of the simmering tensions over shortages of computing power that both big and small tech companies are grappling with in developing generative AI, which requires specialized chips that aren&#x27;t freely available. Big tech firms have more computing resources than most, and some, like Meta, highlight that fact when recruiting AI researchers. But even they are limited in what they can supply. The exodus also highlights the challenges for big tech companies in retaining highly prized AI researchers as demand for AI talent surges. More than half the 14 authors of the original Llama research paper published in February have left the company, several for AI startups or other big companies, the people with direct knowledge said.

From a report: The software giant has started testing the changes to Windows 11 in recent test builds of the operating system, but the changes are restricted to countries within the European Economic Area (EEA). &quot;In the European Economic Area (EEA), Windows system components use the default browser to open links,&quot; reads a change note from a Windows 11 test build released to Dev Channel testers last month. Microsoft has been ignoring default browser choices in its search experience in Windows 10 and the taskbar widget that forces users into Edge if they click a link instead of their default browser. Windows 11 continued this trend, with search still forcing users into Edge and a new dedicated widgets area that also ignores the default browser setting.

                              <span>Apple is developing a low-cost MacBook series to compete with Chromebook models in the education sector that could be launched as early as the second half of 2024, claims a new report out of Taiwan. From a report: According to DigiTimes&#x27; industry sources, Apple will likely launch the new product line to differentiate it from the company&#x27;s existing MacBook Air and Pro lines. The outer appearance will still use a metal casing but will be made of &quot;different materials&quot; and the cost of the mechanical components will be lower, claims the report. The launch timeframe for the alleged new MacBook series appears to be based on a lack of related activity at major Apple suppliers like Quanta Computer and Foxconn, making a launch in the first half of next year unlikely.

                              <span>Julian Assange&#x27;s supporters will urge the US to drop the prosecution of the Australian citizen on the basis the &quot;very dangerous&quot; precedent will be exploited by China and Russia. From a report: Six Australian politicians are expected to focus on freedom-of-speech arguments when they fly to Washington DC later this month to warn against extraditing the WikiLeaks founder from the UK. The MPs and senators from across the political spectrum are aiming to help build momentum for the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, to raise the case in bilateral talks with Joe Biden at the White House in late October. The trip is being funded by the Assange campaign. 

Assange remains in Belmarsh prison in London as he fights a US attempt to extradite him to face charges in connection with the publication of hundreds of thousands of leaked documents about the Afghanistan and Iraq wars as well as diplomatic cables. Greg Barns SC, an adviser to the Assange campaign, said on Tuesday that it was &quot;not an ordinary run-of-the-mill extradition case.&quot; He said freedom of speech was &quot;an important theme in the US.&quot; 

&quot;You&#x27;ve got China chasing journalists around the world, and you&#x27;ve got the Russians who have recently arrested journalists,&quot; Barns told Guardian Australia. &quot;You&#x27;ve now got China using the Assange case as a sort of moral equivalence argument. So the message [of the Australian delegation] is going to be: this is very dangerous for journalists around the world and a race to the bottom that&#x27;s going on.&quot;

                              <span>More than 200 scientists have signed onto a letter pushing for &quot;responsible&quot; research into ways to trap planet-heating carbon dioxide in the world&#x27;s oceans. They want to take urgent action on the climate crisis, while making sure they don&#x27;t trigger any new problems by relying on oceans to help in the fight. From a report: Polluters have trashed the world&#x27;s atmosphere with carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels. That blanket of pollution is already warming the planet and causing more extreme weather disasters. One way to keep climate change from getting worse is to take some of those historic emissions out of the atmosphere. 

Oceans already do that for us, absorbing and holding around 50 times more carbon than the atmosphere. What if humans could supercharge that ability? That&#x27;s what scientists want to better understand, along with any side effects that might come with messing with the chemistry of our oceans. Startups are already developing new technologies to sequester more CO2 in the sea. But there&#x27;s still a lot we don&#x27;t know about what impact that might have or what strategies might be most successful, the letter says.

From a report: Baidu joins several other Chinese companies that launched AI chatbots last week after securing regulatory approval for mass market releases. These include facial recognition firm SenseTime and AI startups Baichuan Intelligent Technology, Zhipu AI, and MiniMax. Li said the latest version of Baidu&#x27;s AI chatbot, Ernie 3.5, has processing speed twice that of the previous version with 50% improved efficiency. Li also revealed that Baidu will launch a new version in the near future.

                              <span>As a growing number of hackers target companies, organisations and industries with debilitating attacks, more skilled cyber security workers are urgently needed to combat the threat.ÂFrom a report: ISC2, the world&#x27;s largest association of cyber professionals, estimates that the cyber security workforce in 2022 stood at about 4.7mn people globally. But a further 3.4mn roles remain unfilled. &quot;The gap is massive,&quot; says Clar Rosso, ISC2&#x27;s chief executive. &quot;This shortfall is felt more acutely in countries such as India where digitisation is rapid. But even in the US, only 69 per cent of cyber roles are filled, according to Cyberseek, a website that provides data about the cyber security job market.&quot; 

Beyond a talent shortfall, existing workers are underskilled. A UK government report this year found that 50 per cent of UK businesses -- some 739,000 in total -- have a basic cyber skills gap, meaning that those in charge of cyber security lack the confidence to carry out the technical measures that protect against the most common digital attacks. Previously, it was thought that a company&#x27;s IT team could take care of all cyber security concerns. But &quot;over time, it became clear that this needed specialised attention,&quot; Rosso says, adding that, after some high-profile ransomware attacks over the past couple of years, &quot;business executives are now paying attention.&quot;

                              <span>The future of wearable technology, beyond now-standard accessories like smartwatches and fitness tracking rings, is ePANTS, according to the intelligence community. The Intercept: The federal government has shelled out at least $22 million in an effort to develop &quot;smart&quot; clothing that spies on the wearer and its surroundings. Similar to previous moonshot projects funded by military and intelligence agencies, the inspiration may have come from science fiction and superpowers, but the basic applications are on brand for the government: surveillance and data collection. Billed as the &quot;largest single investment to develop Active Smart Textiles,&quot; the SMART ePANTS -- Smart Electrically Powered and Networked Textile Systems -- program aims to develop clothing capable of recording audio, video, and geolocation data, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence announced in an August 22 press release. Garments slated for production include shirts, pants, socks, and underwear, all of which are intended to be washable. 

The project is being undertaken by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, the intelligence community&#x27;s secretive counterpart to the military&#x27;s better-known Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA. IARPA&#x27;s website says it &quot;invests federal funding into high-risk, high reward projects to address challenges facing the intelligence community.&quot; Its tolerance for risk has led to both impressive achievements, like a Nobel Prize awarded to physicist David Wineland for his research on quantum computing funded by IARPA, as well as costly failures. &quot;A lot of the IARPA and DARPA programs are like throwing spaghetti against the refrigerator,&quot; Annie Jacobsen, author of a book about DARPA, &quot;The Pentagon&#x27;s Brain,&quot; told The Intercept. &quot;It may or may not stick.&quot;

Medobed, an Indian startup that promises medicine delivery in 10 minutes, was initially selected in Y Combinator&#x27;s S23 batch. In recent weeks, Y Combinator has severed its ties with the Indian firm and a partner at the venture firm has also suggested many prospective investors to not engage with Medobed, according to two people familiar with the matter and a copy of an email obtained by TechCrunch. It&#x27;s very rare for Y Combinator, which selects a few hundred startups from tens of thousands of applications, to remove a firm from its coveted batch, the report adds.

Modern gaming consoles are forbidden on the grounds that they can connect to the internet, so the typical purchase is a Playstation 1. No version of Microsoft Windows more recent than Windows 98 is allowed. No device that can play MP3 files is allowed. The regulations forbid operating systems other than Microsoft DOS or Windows and any software capable of creating a program, such as a compiler as are &quot;database programs capable of altering or manipulating SQL databases&quot;. Although learning job skills is encouraged, programming is evidently not considered appropriate. The relationship of most of these restrictions to security is obscure.

                              <span>Microsoft has announced billing in public preview for Teams recording and transcription APIs, with pricing starting at 3 cents per minute for recordings. From a report: Getting meeting transcripts and recordings using Graph APIs is currently in public developer preview, so the billing, which started on September 1, might irk coders keen to use these features in their applications. The API for recording is billed at $0.03 per minute, and the API for transcription is $0.024 per minute. 

Microsoft cited line-of-business applications or ISV solutions in sales or HR as potential use cases for the technology, which permits recordings as an MP4 video file or transcripts as VTT files to be downloaded. VTT includes handy information such as the spoken words, timings, language, and the names of the speakers. A developer could automatically generate notes and attach meeting clips using one or both content API sets. Other information, such as sentiment and engagement metrics, could also be generated.

                              <span>A proposal to phase out CO2-emitting fossil fuels at COP27 last won backing from more than 80 countries but oil and gas-rich nations opposed it. European Union countries are preparing to push for a global deal on phasing out fossil fuels at the COP28 climate summit, a draft of the EU&#x27;s negotiating position has shown. From a report: Diplomats from the bloc&#x27;s 27 member states are drafting their position for the summit in Dubai in November, where nearly 200 countries will try to strengthen efforts to rein in climate change. &quot;The shift towards a climate neutral economy will require the global phase-out of [unabated] fossil fuels and a peak in their consumption already in the near term,&quot; a draft of the EU&#x27;s negotiating stance, seen by Reuters, says. 

Countries have never agreed in UN climate negotiations to gradually stop burning all CO2-emitting fossil fuels, despite this being the main cause of climate change. &quot;Unabated&quot; refers to fossil fuels burned without using technologies to capture the resulting CO2 emissions. The word was in brackets in the draft EU text, indicating that countries have not yet agreed on whether to include it. EU diplomats hope a deal can be made at COP28 - but expect to meet resistance from economies reliant on income from selling oil and gas.

                              <span>Invasive species are costing the world at least $423bn every year and have become a leading threat to the diversity of life on Earth, according to a UN assessment. From a news report: From invasive mice that eat seabird chicks in their nests to non-native grasses that helped fuel and intensify last month&#x27;s deadly fires in Hawaii, at least 3,500 harmful invasive species have been recorded globally in every region, spread by human travel and trade. Their impact is destructive for humans and wildlife, sometimes causing extinctions and permanently damaging the healthy functioning of an ecosystem. 

Leading scientists say the threat posed by invasive species is under appreciated, underestimated and sometimes unacknowledged, with more than 37,000 alien species now known to be introduced around the world and about 200 establishing themselves each year. While not all will become invasive, experts say there are significant tools to mitigate their spread and impact, protecting and restoring ecosystems in the process. 

&quot;Invasive alien species are a major threat to biodiversity and can cause irreversible damage to nature, including local and global species extinctions, and also threaten human wellbeing,&quot; wrote Prof Helen Roy, Prof Anibal Pauchard and Prof Peter Stoett, who led the research. &quot;It would be an extremely costly mistake to regard biological invasions only as someone else&#x27;s problem,&quot; said Pauchard. &quot;Although the specific species that inflict damage vary from place to place, these are risks and challenges with global roots but very local impacts facing people in every country, from all backgrounds and in every community -- even Antarctica is being affected.&quot;

                              <span>The London Stock Exchange Group has drawn up plans for a new digital markets business, saying this will make it the first major exchange to offer extensive trading of traditional financial assets on the blockchain technology best known for powering cryptocurrency. From a report: Murray Roos, head of capital&#x27;s markets at the LSE Group, told the Financial Times that the company had been examining the potential for a blockchain-powered trading venue for about a year, and had reached an &quot;inflection point&quot; where it had decided to take the plans forward. It has asked Julia Hoggett, head of the London Stock Exchange, one unit in the broader group, to spearhead the project. 

Roos stressed that his exchange was &quot;definitely not building anything around cryptoassets&quot; but was looking to use the technology that underpins popular tokens such as bitcoin to improve the efficiency of buying, selling and holding traditional assets. &quot;The idea is to use digital technology to make a process that is slicker, smoother, cheaper and more transparent and to have it regulated,&quot; Roos said. He added that LSEG had waited to proceed until it was sure that the public blockchain technology was &quot;good enough&quot; and that investors were ready.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: If Apple had its way, the iPhone would continue to use the current Lightning connector for the next few years -- until the point when the company is ready to begin phasing out ports on its smartphones altogether. But the European Union forced its hand, requiring mobile device makers to use the USB-C standard by the end of next year. So Apple is now in the awkward position of embracing the very technology it didn&#x27;t want. When the company introduces the iPhone 15 on Sept. 12, USB-C connectors will appear on its four new phone models, as well as the AirPods Pro, and Apple will describe it as a major win for customers. 

Customers will be able to use a single charging cable for iPhones, Macs and iPads. It will bring breakthrough data transfer speed increases for the new high-end iPhone models. Phones will charge faster in some instances. And, finally, the phones will be compatible with chargers used by billions of non-Apple devices. 

Why will Apple be so upbeat about a change it didn&#x27;t ask for? That&#x27;s because the company has an iron-clad rule: When it&#x27;s introducing a new product or dealing with the media, it always wants to operate from a position of strength. Apple&#x27;s keynote presentation won&#x27;t mention the European Union or make reference to the many times over the past few years that it criticized the government&#x27;s decision to require USB-C. Back when it was still resisting the switch, Apple laid out a few arguments, including that the change would harm the environment -- given that billions of obsolete cables may wind up in a landfill. Another rationale, floated by Apple marketing chief Greg Joswiak last year, is the potentially harmful precedent of governments influencing product design.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this report from the Washington Post:

On April 26, 1986, the infamous explosion at a Chernobyl nuclear power plant unleashed large amounts of radiation into the atmosphere, an event that contaminated wildlife across country lines. The radiation levels seen in animals as a result has decreased in recent years — with the exception of one animal: the wild boar. For years, scientists questioned why levels of a radioactive isotope known as cesium-137 have remained surprisingly high in wild boars rooting around Germany and Austria, while decreasing in other deer and roe deer. In a new study released last week, a team of researchers finally solved this &quot;wild boar paradox.&quot; 

They uncovered that the main radioactive source is not the Chernobyl accident but nuclear weapo…</span>

                              <span>&quot;Viasat Inc. has more than $1 billion of orbiting satellites in trouble,&quot; reports Bloomberg, &quot;and space insurers are girding for market-rattling claims.&quot;

The company&#x27;s roughly $1 billion ViaSat-3 Americas satellite, central to expanding its fixed-broadband coverage and fending off rivals including Elon Musk&#x27;s Starlink, suffered an unexpected problem as it deployed its antenna in orbit in April. Should Viasat declare it a total loss, industry executives estimate the claim would reach a record-breaking $420 million and, in turn, make it harder — and more expensive — for other satellite operators to get insurance... Viasat on Aug. 24 reported another stricken spacecraft, saying its Inmarsat-6 F2 satellite launched in February suffered a power problem. The failure may end the craft&#x27;s useful life and result in a $350 million insurance claim, Space Intel Report said. 

Viasat&#x27;s troubles in orbit come a few years after big-name insurers like American International Group Inc. and Allianz SE have shuttered their space portfolios. That&#x27;s left a smaller pool of providers to absorb the risks in the notoriously high-stakes $553 million market... 


Following news of the Inmarsat-6 anomaly, Viasat and other industry participants &quot;will likely experience significant challenges with obtaining insurance for future satellite launches,&quot; [investment banking firm] William Blair&#x27;s Louie DiPalma said in an Aug. 25 note... In 2019, the total losses from satellite claims amounted to $788 million, which overwhelmed the total premiums for the year at $500 million, according to launch and satellite database Seradata. In the years that followed, big names like American International Group Inc., Swiss Re AG, and Allianz SE all closed the door on satellite insurance. 
Earlier this month Viasat&#x27;s CEO says before deciding whether they&#x27;ll file a claim, &quot;There&#x27;s no consequences to us taking another couple or three months to get good measurements and then making those decisions.&quot;

By default cargo audit checks on your Cargo.lock file, but it can also scan compiled binaries. You can install cargo-audit and run it against your project with the following commands:
$ cargo install cargo-audit
$ cargo audit

Both cargo audit and the RustSec advisory database that powers it are maintained by the Rust Secure Code working group.
What&#x27;s new in this release
Performance
cargo audit now uses the sparse crates.io index when checking for yanked crates. This dramatically speeds up the scanning process because cargo audit no longer needs to download the entire crates.io index, which could take up to several minutes.
Sparse index is used by default if you are running Rust 1.70 or later, same as in Carg…</span>

2015: Philadelphia
I first tried to organize a meetup in Philly in 2015. I was
contracting at the time and I figured a meetup might be a good way to
source contracts or just meet interesting people. I created the
&quot;Philadelphia Software in Business&quot; (or some other similarly vaguely
named) group on Meetup.com.
I didn&#x27;t have any network; the first companies I worked for were not
in Philly. But Meetup.com got me a few tens of people joining the
group.
My first challenge was finding a place to meet. I didn&#x27;t know what I

                              <span>CBS News reports:
Floridians battered by Hurricane Idalia this week may not have expected another threat — that floodwaters could cause their cars to suddenly burst into flames. Yet that&#x27;s exactly what happened when two electric vehicles caught fire after being submerged in saltwater churned up by the storm... 

&quot;If you own a hybrid or electric vehicle that has come into contact with saltwater due to recent flooding within the last 24 hours, it is crucial to relocate the vehicle from your garage without delay,&quot; the fire department said in a Facebook post. &quot;Saltwater exposure can trigger combustion in lithium-ion batteries. If possible, transfer your vehicle to higher ground.&quot; The warning also applies to electric golf carts, scooters and bicycles, with lithium-ion batteries potentially sparking a fire when they get wet. More specifically, salt residue remains after the water dries out and can create &quot;bridges&quot; between the battery&#x27;s cells, potentially creating electrical connections that can spark a fire. 
Fire crews were actually towing one of the vehicles when it burst into flames, the article points out. And EV manufacturers want people to take the possibility seriously:

Tesla warns car owners about the risks of vehicle submersion and advises against driving a car that has been flooded. &quot;Treat your vehicle as if it has been in an accident and contact your insurance company,&quot; the company says in its guidance for handling a submerged vehicle.

                              <span>CNN reports that newspaper chain Gannett &quot;has paused the use of an AI tool to write high school sports dispatches after the technology made several major flubs in articles in at least one of its papers.&quot;
In one notable example, preserved by the Internet Archive&#x27;s Wayback Machine, the story began: &quot;The Worthington Christian [[WINNING_TEAM_MASCOT]] defeated the Westerville North [[LOSING_TEAM_MASCOT]] 2-1 in an Ohio boys soccer game on Saturday....&quot; The reports were mocked on social media for being repetitive, lacking key details, using odd language and generally sounding like they&#x27;d been written by a computer with no actual knowledge of sports. 

CNN identified several other local Gannett outlets, including the Louisville Courrier Journal, AZ Central, Florida Today and the Milwaukee Journal…</span>

                              <span>The BBC has an article about Japan&#x27;s release into the sea of treated waste water from the damaged Fukushima nuclear plant. &quot;Scientists largely agree that the impact will be negligible, but China has strongly protested the release. And disinformation has only fuelled fear and suspicion in China.&quot;

A report by a UK-based data analysis company called Logically, which aims to fight misinformation, claims that since January, the Chinese government and state media have been running a coordinated disinformation campaign targeting the release of the waste water. As part of this, mainstream news outlets in China have continually questioned the science behind the nuclear waste water discharge. The rhetoric has only increased since the water was released on 24 August, stoking public anger... Japan&#x27;s foreign ministry even warned its citizens in China to be cautious and to avoid speaking Japanese loudly in public... 

Logically&#x27;s data also showed that, since the beginning of the year, state-owned media have run paid ads on Facebook and Instagram, without disclaimers, about the risks of the waste water release in multiple countries and languages, including English, German, and Khmer. &quot;It is quite evident that this is politically motivated,&quot; Hamsini Hariharan, a China expert at Logically, told the BBC. She added that misleading content from sources related to the Chinese government had intensified the public outcry... 

Dozens of posts on Chinese social media Weibo showed panicked crowds buying giant sacks of salt ahead of the Fukushima water release. Some worried that future supply would be contaminated. Others believed — falsely — that salt protected them against radiation. A restaurant in Shanghai, in an apparent effort to profit off the hysteria, advertised &quot;anti-radiation&quot; meals with errant claims of reducing skin damage and cell regeneration. A social media user asked wryly, &quot;Why would I pay 28 yuan for tomato with seasoning?&quot;

After years of ducking scrutiny, Jan Sramek, the former Goldman Sachs trader spearheading the effort, launched a website Thursday about &quot;California Forever.&quot; The site billed the project as &quot;a chance for a new community, good paying local jobs, solar farms, and open space&quot; in Solano, a rural county between San Francisco and Sacramento that is now home to 450,000 people.

                              <span>&quot;Two stalled driverless taxis blocked an ambulance carrying a critically injured patient,&quot; writes the San Francisco Chronicle, citing a paywalled report from Forbes. The delay &quot;contributed to &#x27;poor patient outcome&#x27; — the person died 20 to 30 minutes after reaching the hospital, according to a report by San Francisco firefighters that the taxi company disputes.&quot; 

The report was obtained by Forbes, which recently published a story detailing accounts by San Francisco firefighters who say driverless taxis have repeatedly interfered with their emergency response. However, Forbes also reported that Cruise provided a video that disputed SFFD&#x27;s account of the August 14 incident. The video, Forbes reported, shows that one Cruise car quickly left the scene while the other remained stalled at the intersection with an open lane to its right, which traffic was passing through. Forbes said it was not clear from the video if the ambulance could have navigated into the open lane. 

Hannah Lindow, a Cruise spokesperson, told the Chronicle that the Cruise vehicle that stopped did so to yield to first responders directing traffic. &quot;Throughout the entire duration the (autonomous vehicle) is stopped, traffic remains unblocked and flowing to the right of the AV. The ambulance behind the AV had a clear path to pass the AV as other vehicles, including another ambulance, proceeded to do,&quot; Lindow said in an email. &quot;As soon as the victim was loaded into the ambulance, the ambulance left the scene immediately and was never impeded from doing so by the AV.&quot;

                              <span>To complete one full rotation around its axis it takes the moon 655 hours. So a single &quot;lunar day&quot; is 13.64 earth days. 

But sunset has finally come for India&#x27;s Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft and its Pragyan rover, writes long-time Slashdot reader Geoffrey.landis , and the rover has switched off for the coming 655-hour night:
With luck from the moon gods, it will wake up with the sunrise in 14 days. But, even if not, mission accomplished! It was designed for fourteen days of operation, the daylight period. In that time the rover accomplished just over a hundred meters (American units: one football field) of traverse, examining and chemically analyzing the surface. 


&quot;The Indian Express newspaper said the electronics on board the Indian moon mission werenâ(TM)t designed to withstand very low temperatures, less than -120 C (-184 F) during the nighttime on the moon,&quot; according to the Associated Press. But the rover&#x27;s accomplishments already include making the first-ever measurements of the south pole&#x27;s near-surface Lunar plasma, and confirming the presence of aluminum, calcium, chromium, titanium, manganese, and silicon. There&#x27;s also sulphur, iron, oxygen and other elements on the moon, Reuters reports, citing a statement from the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO):

The Pragyan rover from the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft was &quot;set into Sleep mode&quot; but with batteries charged and receiver on, the ISRO said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, late on Saturday. &quot;Hoping for a successful awakening for another set of assignments!&quot; ISRO said. &quot;Else, it will forever stay there as India&#x27;s lunar ambassador.&quot; 



Earlier this week the ISRO posted footage of the rover completing a near-pirouette to search for the safest route. 

&quot;The solar panel is oriented to receive the light at the next sunrise expected on September 22, 2023,&quot; the ISRO posted Saturday.

                              <span>&quot;Microsoft has quietly revealed that WordPad, the basic word processor that&#x27;s been included with Windows since 1995, is being retired,&quot; reports Windows blog Paul Thurrott:
&quot;WordPad is no longer being updated and will be removed in a future release of Windows,&quot; the Deprecated features for Windows client page on Microsoft Learn notes in a September 1, 2023 addition. &quot;We recommend Microsoft Word for rich text documents like .doc and .rtf and Windows Notepad for plain text documents like .txt....&quot; 

[W]hile Microsoft&#x27;s advice to use Microsoft Word instead seems a bit off-base, given that Word is a paid product, RTF is rarely used these days, and anyone can access the web versions of Word for free if needed. 

The actual date of removal is unclear. But Neowinisn&#x27;t the only thing Microsoft is removing from Windows:
The company recently turned off Cortana, its neglected voice assistant, and announced the end of Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT). Also, Microsoft will soon disable old Transport Layer Security protocols to make Windows 11 more secure.

For those wondering why the Steam Linux numbers dropped while the Steam Deck continues to be very popular, it&#x27;s possibly again another month impacted by large swings in Chinese traffic... SteamOS Holo that powers the Steam Deck gained another 2% marketshare to now commanding around 44% of the reported Linux gamers. 

Among Linux gamers, AMD CPUs power around 71% of the systems. In part due to the Steam Deck being powered by an AMD APU. Meanwhile Steam on Windows has the AMD CPU marketshare at around 33%.

                              <span>Vanity Fair revisits the many warning signs about OceanGate&#x27;s Titan submersible prior to an implosion on June 18th that killed all five passengers onboard. 


A professional expedition leader tells their reporter that &quot;This tragedy was predicted. It was avoidable. It was inevitable.&quot;

As the world now knows, Stockton Rush touted himself as a maverick, a disrupter, a breaker of rules. So far out on the visionary curve that, for him, safety regulations were mere suggestions. &quot;If you&#x27;re not breaking things, you&#x27;re not innovating,&quot; he declared at the 2022 GeekWire Summit. &quot;If you&#x27;re operating within a known environment, as most submersible manufacturers do, they don&#x27;t break things. To me, the more stuff you&#x27;ve broken, the more innovative you&#x27;ve been.&quot; In a culture that has adopted the ridiculo…</span>

                              <span>Santiago Valdarrama teaches machine learning. He posted this week on Twitter and LinkedIn that &quot;Scrum is a cancer.&quot; Some highlights:
I&#x27;ve been writing software for 25 years, and nothing renders a software team useless like Scrum does... We spent more time talking than doing... We spent more time estimating story points than writing software... Imagine having a manager, a scrum master, a product owner, and a tech lead. You had to answer to all of them and none simultaneously... 

I believe in Agile, but this ain&#x27;t agile... The result was always the same: It didn&#x27;t work. Scrum is a cancer that will eat your development team. Scrum is not for developers; it&#x27;s another tool for managers to feel they are in control. 

DevOps.com shares some reactions, including the developer who calls Scrum &quot;a life-sucking batch of meetings that are good for one thing: Taking developers who can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t want to see the overall business/architecture picture and getting useful work out of them.&quot; 

But later in the week, Valdarrama revisited the issue with a follow-up post. &quot;After 3,400 replies, I learned a few things.&quot;
First, the most common jobs among the people who told me I was wrong were &quot;Agile Coach&quot; and &quot;Scrum Master....&quot; 
Second, Scrum can&#x27;t fail because Scrum is whatever you want Scrum to be. There&#x27;s no right way to do Scrum, so if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, you aren&#x27;t as bright as you thought you were. 

Third, Scrum isn&#x27;t agile, except when it is. But it&#x27;s much better than Waterfall, except when it isn&#x27;t. And it&#x27;s better than nothing and everything at the same time. 

Fourth, many people got triggered by my comparison of Scrum and communism... 

Finally, by far, most people hate Scrum with passion.

Now the photos along with her name and contact information were on 4chan, a lawless website that allows users to post anonymously about topics as varied as music and white supremacy... Facebook users registered under fake names such as &quot;Joe Bummer&quot; sent her direct messages demanding that she send new, explicit photos, or else they would further spread the already leaked photos. Some pictures landed in her father&#x27;s Instagram messages, while marketing clients told her about the nude images that came their way. Madison was at a friend&#x27;s party when she got…</span>

                              <span>&quot;Are you old enough to remember channel surfing?&quot; asks long-time Slashdog reader MightyMait. &quot;When there were only a handful of broadcast channels, it wasn&#x27;t a big deal...&quot;

But when we got cable/satelite, one could spend inordinate amounts of time flipping through the channels looking for something decent to watch. Now, with the proliferation of streaming services... 

Streaming viewers are now &quot;spending a record 10.5 minutes per session deciding what to watch,&quot; according to TV Tech, citing a new study from the Nielsen-owned entertainment-data company Gracenote. 

Their 2023 State of Play report &quot;found that that there were 1.9 million video titles available to viewers in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Mexico and Germany in July 2021, a number that had swelled to 2.7 million titles by June 2023.&quot;
Of the total count, a whopping 86.7% were available on streaming services. Compounding complexity, many popular shows now appear in multiple streaming catalogs, as the industry pivots from offering content exclusivity to broad distribution strategies that companies hope will balance massive streaming loses, the report noted. The Gracenote analysis also found that audiences now have nearly 40,000 individual FAST channels, streaming providers and aggregators to choose from. 

The original submission from MightyMait asks Slashdot readers: &quot;Are you feeling the pain? And if so, &quot;What strategies do you employ to avoid this time suck?&quot; 
Share your own thoughts and experiences in the comments. And do streamers spend more time deciding what to watch?

                              <span>Slashdot reader martiniturbide writes: ArcaOS 5.1.0 is an OEM distribution of IBM&#x27;s discontinued OS/2 Warp operating system. This new version of ArcaOS offers UEFI compatibility allowing it to run in modern x86 hardware and also includes the ability to install to GPT-based disk layouts. 

At OS2World the OS/2 community has been called upon to report supported hardware, open source any OS/2 software, make public as much OS/2 documentation as possible and post the important platform links. OS2World insists that open source has helped OS/2 in the past years and it is time to look under the hood to try to clone internal components like Control Program, Presentation Manager, SOM and Workplace Shell.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares The Hill&#x27;s report from earlier this month. Apparently America&#x27;s tax-collecting Internal Revenue Service &quot;cannot locate thousands of microfilm cartridges containing millions of sensitive individual and business tax account records, according to a watchdog report.&quot;

The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration said in a report released August 8 that the IRS cannot account for microfilm cartridges — which contain backups of tax records as required under federal law — from fiscal 2010 that were originally stored at a processing center in Fresno, California... The watchdog also found seven empty boxes, which could hold up to 168 cartridges total, at the Ogden Tax Processing Center in Utah. Ogden personnel did not know where the missing cartridges were. 

More than 4,000 cartridges containing business tax account information from fiscal 2018 and 4,500 cartridges containing individual tax account information from fiscal 2019 also could not be accounted for at the Kansas City facility, according to the report. 

&quot;The personal taxpayer and tax information included on these backup cartridges is key information that can be used to commit tax refund fraud identity theft,&quot; the report noted.

                              <span>&quot;Generally you may not carry a concealed firearm on your person in public,&quot; warns a California government web site, &quot;unless you have a valid Carry Concealed Weapon (CCW) license.&quot; And a California appellate court associated justice writes that in the county where Apple is located, &quot;the Santa Clara County Sheriff&#x27;s Office rarely issued CCW licenses.&quot; 

This has led to Thomas Moyer, Apple&#x27;s head of global security, facing bribery charges, reports Reason&#x27;s legal blog, the Volokh Conspiracy. According to the judge&#x27;s statement (citing the case of the public defender)...

...the Santa Clara County undersheriff requested — and defendant Thomas Moyer made — a promise to donate iPads to the Santa Clara County Sheriff&#x27;s Office in exchange for releasing concealed carry weapon licenses that the sheriff had signed. Consistent with the Ninth Circuit&#x27;s interpretation of California law, federal law and the law in many states, we conclude that such a promise may constitute a bribe. We also conclude that the evidence presented to the grand jury was sufficient to raise a reasonable suspicion of such bribery. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court&#x27;s order dismissing the bribery count against Moyer, reinstate that count, and remand for further proceedings.

                              <span>What caused Monday&#x27;s glitch in the UK&#x27;s air traffic control system that left thousands of passengers stranded? 

Wednesday the Independent reported that it may have been triggered by &quot;an incorrectly filed flight plan by a French airline.&quot;

Several sources say the issue may have been caused when a French airline filed a dodgy flight plan that made no digital sense. Instead of the error being rejected, it prompted a shutdown of the entire National Air Traffic Services (Nats) system — raising questions over how one clerical error could cause such mayhem... Downing Street has launched an independent review into the incident, which caused more than a quarter of flights at UK airports to be cancelled on Monday... 

In his statement, Nats chief executive Martin Rolfe said Nats&#x27; systems, both primary and the back-ups, responded to the incorrect flight data by suspending automatic processing &quot;to ensure that no incorrect safety-related information could be presented to an air traffic controller or impact the rest of the air traffic system&quot;. 

The article also points out that &quot;Passengers hit by the air traffic control meltdown face being stranded abroad for up to a week.&quot;

Around 300,000 airline passengers have now been hit by flight cancellations since the hours-long failure of the Nats system on bank holiday Monday. The knock-on effect is set to last for several more days, as under-pressure airlines battle the backlog in a week where millions are already returning to the UK from their summer holidays.

Germany &quot;ultimately completed its nuclear exit in April 2023,&quot; while France &quot;has the highest share of nuclear in the energy mix of any country in the world.&quot;


[A] major concern is that more nuclear means less renewables, at a time when wind and solar need all the scale they can get... In a joint attempt to provide greater technical clarity on the nuclear power debate, French think tank IDDRI and German Agora Energiewende set out in 2018 to understand how nuclear energy will influence the transformation of energy systems in both countries.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this report from cybersecurity blogger Brian Krebs:

Domain names ending in &quot;.US&quot; — the top-level domain for the United States — are among the most prevalent in phishing scams, new research shows. This is noteworthy because .US is overseen by the U.S. government, which is frequently the target of phishing domains ending in .US. Also, .US domains are only supposed to be available to U.S. citizens and to those who can demonstrate that they have a physical presence in the United States... [F]ew other major countries in the world have anywhere near as many phishing domains each year as .US. 

That&#x27;s according to The Interisle Consulting Group, which gathers phishing data from multiple industry sources and publishes an annual report on the latest trends. Interisle&#x27;s newest study examined six million phishing reports between May 1, 2022 and April 30, 2023, and found 30,000 .US phishing domains. 

.US is overseen by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), an executive branch agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce. However, NTIA currently contracts out the management of the .US domain to GoDaddy, by far the world&#x27;s largest domain registrar. Under NTIA regulations, the administrator of the .US registry must take certain steps to verify that their customers actually reside in the United States, or own organizations based in the U.S. But Interisle found that whatever GoDaddy was doing to manage that vetting process wasn&#x27;t working.

                              <span>The Verge argues we&#x27;re seeing &quot;the end of the Googleverse. For two decades, Google Search was the invisible force that determined the ebb and flow of online content. 

&quot;Now, for the first time, its cultural relevance is in question... all around us are signs that the era of &#x27;peak Google&#x27; is ending or, possibly, already over.&quot;

There is a growing chorus of complaints that Google is not as accurate, as competent, as dedicated to search as it once was. The rise of massive closed algorithmic social networks like Meta&#x27;s Facebook and Instagram began eating the web in the 2010s. 	More recently, there&#x27;s been a shift to entertainment-based video feeds like TikTok — which is now being used as a primary search engine by a new generation of internet users...

                              <span>Kotaku reports that last week 29-year old Darin Harris &quot;allegedly stole dozens of copies of the game from a warehouse and started selling them online,&quot; prompting lots of pre-release leaks for the game. 

&quot;One Reddit user immediately reported the leaks to Bethesda and Memphis police,&quot; adds Kotaku. &quot;And he&#x27;s now been banned from the r/GamingLeaksAndRumours subreddit after posting about it.&quot;

I know this because the commenter in question, Jasper Adkins, emailed Kotaku to inform us it had happened. &quot;It seems to me that the subreddit is running on &#x27;bread and circuses&#x27; mode mixed with bystander syndrome,&quot; he wrote in his initial email. &quot;They&#x27;re perfectly willing to ignore a crime that hurts a developer they claim to support, in exchange for a few minutes of shaky gameplay filmed from a phone....…</span>

The implanted neurons are designed to produce dopamine, which is deficient in Parkinson&#x27;s patients, and early data suggests they may have survived and improved symptoms in some cases. MIT Technology Review reports: The study is one of the largest and most costly tests yet of embryonic-stem-cell technology, the controversial and much-hyped approach of using stem cells taken from IVF embryos to produce replacement tissue and body parts. The replacement neurons were manufactured using powerful stem cells originally sourced from a human embryo created an in vitro fertilization procedure.

                              <span>The U.S. Department of Defense has launched a website collecting publicly available, declassified information on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs). &quot;For now, the general public will be able to read through the posted information,&quot; reports CNET. &quot;Soon, US government employees, contractors, and service members with knowledge of US programs can report their own sightings, and later, others will be able to submit reports.&quot; From the report: &quot;This website will provide information, including photos and videos, on resolved UAP cases as they are declassified and approved for public release,&quot; the department said in a release posted on Thursday. &quot;The website&#x27;s other content includes reporting trends and a frequently asked questions section as well as links to official reports, transcripts, press releases, and other resources that the public may find useful, such as applicable statutes and aircraft, balloon and satellite tracking sites.&quot;
 
For now, one of the most interesting parts of the site is its trends section. Apparently, most reported UAPs are round, either white, silver or translucent, spotted at around 10,000 to 30,000 feet, 1-4 meters in size, and do not emit thermal exhaust. Hotspots for sightings include both the US East and West coasts. There&#x27;s also a small section of videos with names such as &quot;DVIDS Video - Unresolved Case: Navy 2021 Flyby,&quot; and &quot;UAP Video: Middle East Object.&quot; Readers are able to leave comments on the videos. Of the &quot;Middle East Object&quot; video, one person writes,&quot;Noticed I never saw it cast a shadow. But other objects have shadows.&quot;

A genomics analysis of more than 3,000 living people suggested that our ancestors&#x27; total population plummeted to about 1,280 breeding individuals for about 117,000 years. Scientists believe that an extreme climate event could have led to the bottleneck that came close to wiping out our ancestral line. &quot;The numbers that emerge from our study correspond to those of species that are currently at risk of extinction,&quot; said Prof Giorgio Manzi, an anthropologist at Sapienza University of Rome and a senior author of the research.

                              <span>&quot;The NYC police department intends to use drones to monitor Labor Day backyard parties, raising privacy concerns,&quot; writes Slashdot reader jjslash. &quot;Drone usage by U.S. police departments is increasing, with some operating them beyond visual line of sight. TechSpot reports: &quot;If a caller states there&#x27;s a large crowd, a large party in a backyard, we&#x27;re going to be utilizing our assets to go up and go check on the party,&quot; said assistant NYPD Commissioner Kaz Daughtry at a recent press conference. Naturally, the admission attracted the attention of privacy and civil liberties advocates who questioned if the department&#x27;s plans violate existing laws governing surveillance in the area.
 
In its unmanned aircraft systems (UAS): Impact and use policy from 2021, the NYC police department said drones would not be used in areas where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy without a search warrant, except in exigent circumstances (PDF). Are backyard parties really all that pressing? &quot;Deploying drones in this way is a sci-fi inspired scenario,&quot; said Daniel Schwarz, a technology and privacy strategist with the New York Civil Liberties Union. Schwarz added that it is at variance with the Public Oversight of Surveillance Technology (POST) Act, which &quot;requires the reporting and evaluation of surveillance technologies used by the NYPD.&quot;

                              <span>Microsoft has patented an AI-powered backpack design featuring a plethora of sensors that may include cameras, microphones, GPS, and a compass. Tom&#x27;s Hardware reports: Additionally, Microsoft thinks it may be useful to add in LEDs and speakers, as well as a haptic actuator, into the straps. Some real-time processing is deemed necessary to the smart wearable. Thus, various recognition modules are proposed to provide image, text, speech, facial, and cognitive recognition. As well as real-time monitors feeding data to the built-in processing power for AI smarts, the system housed in the backpack also will boast a recording device (using on-board storage), wireless connectivity, battery power / charging and more.
 
With all the above sensing and processing on your person, in the backpack, it is envisioned that wearers will benefit from AI enhanced object identification and analysis, nearby device interaction, and be able to gain contextual insights. A flow chart shows how the backpack and its data feed might work alongside personal computers and cloud servers. Other illustrations show the wandering backpack wearer navigating a ski resort, and checking out supermarket prices, as well as considering booking concert tickets. Sometimes the user may interact with the backpack&#x27;s on-board AI via speech, e.g. &quot;Hey Backpack, add this poster to my calendar.&quot; Alternatively some AI actions or contextual tasks may be instigated by interacting with sensors on the straps. You can view the patent application here.

Sal Khan, academy founder, said Caltech&#x27;s action is a &quot;huge deal&quot; for equitable access to college. While Caltech is small -- only 2,400 students, about 40% of them undergraduates -- Khan said he hoped its prestigious reputation would encourage other institutions to examine their admission barriers and find creative solutions to ease them.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from ExtremeTech: Slowly but surely, sales of electric cars have crept upward as traditional automakers finally embrace EVs. Nissan was early to the electric future with the venerable if modest Leaf. Nissan is now looking to turn old Leafs into something new by harvesting their batteries. The company has begun selling portable power banks built around refurbished automotive batteries, which could give these expensive Leaf cells a new lease on life. The Lithium-ion cells in vehicles have the same properties as the battery in your phone. They start out with a specific power rating, but successive discharge-recharge cycles cause physical stress to the internal structure. Eventually, this results in reduced capacity and voltage. However, Nissan says most Leaf owners stop driving the car before the battery stops working. In fact, many of the individual cells are still in good shape when the vehicles are discarded.
 
Each Nissan Leaf has around 48 lithium-ion battery modules -- the exact number depends on model. While some may be in poor shape at the end of a car&#x27;s life, Nissan has taken to disassembling the battery packs to refurbish working modules. The result is the Nissan portable power station, which was developed in partnership with JVCKenwood Corp. and 4R Energy Corp. The bulky 32-pound portable chargers contain two Leaf battery modules with about 80% of their original capacity intact. They&#x27;re no longer suitable for driving an EV, but they can still charge your phone. Nissan sells the battery packs in Japan for 170,500 yen (about $1,170). That might sound like a lot, but it&#x27;s actually not bad for a super high-capacity battery pack. Each of Nissan&#x27;s current-gen battery modules is 1.67 kWh, which converts to 112 Ah (112,000 mAh). Assuming a 20% loss in capacity, two of them would have enough juice to charge the largest current iPhone more than 40 times.

                              <span>Lenovo&#x27;s upcoming 27-inch 4K monitor offers a unique experience unlike any other display: glasses-free 3D that can be toggled on and off. According to Ars Technica, the monitor features a lenticular lens and real-time eye-tracking to create the effect. It&#x27;s being targeted at content creators, like 3D graphic designers and developers. From the report: Like other glasses-less 3D screens, [Lenovo&#x27;s ThinkVision 27 3D Monitor] works by projecting two different images to each of your eyes, resulting in a 3D effect where, as PR images would have you believe, it appears that the images are popping out of the screen. Lenovo says the monitor&#x27;s 3D resolution is 1920x2160. The lenticular lens in the monitor is switchable, allowing for normal, 2D viewing at 3840x2160, too. The ThinkVision&#x27;s 27-inch display gives workers a bigger palette. It also means the monitor can be a regular 2D monitor when needed. [...]
 
As a regular 2D monitor, the ThinkVision&#x27;s specs are pretty standard. It&#x27;s a 4K IPS screen claiming a 60 Hz refresh rate, 310 nits, a 1,000:1 contrast ratio, and 99 percent DCI-P3 and Adobe RGB color coverage with a Delta E under 2. Like a proper workplace monitor, there&#x27;s also a strong port selection: two HDMI 2.1, one DisplayPort 1.4, four USB-A (3.1 Gen 1) ports, one USB-C port (3.2 Gen 1) with up to 15 W power delivery, RJ45, a 3.5mm jack, plus an upstream USB-C port with up to 100 W power delivery.

                              <span>Robinhood announced it has purchased more than 55 million shares of the firm previously held by former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, which were seized in January by the U.S. Department of Justice as part of the criminal case against FTX and its executives. CoinTelegraph reports: The purchase had been expected. Robinhood&#x27;s board of directors announced the approval of the deal in the company&#x27;s Q4 2022 report, and an Aug. 30 SEC filing said the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York had approved the purchase &quot;free and clear of any claims, interests, liens and encumbrances.&quot; Robinhood made the repurchase agreement with the U.S. Marshals Service. &quot;We are happy to have completed the purchase of these shares and look forward to executing on our growth plans on behalf of our customers and shareholders,&quot; said Robinhood chief financial officer Jason Warnick.

                              <span>Samsung today revealed the world&#x27;s first 32 Gb DDR5 DRAM die. From a report: The new memory die is made on the company&#x27;s 12 nm-class DRAM fabrication process and not only offers increased density, but also lowers power consumption. The chip will allow Samsung to build record 1 TB RDIMMs for servers as well as lower costs of high-capacity memory modules. &quot;With our 12nm-class 32 Gb DRAM, we have secured a solution that will enable DRAM modules of up to 1 TB, allowing us to be ideally positioned to serve the growing need for high-capacity DRAM in the era of AI (Artificial Intelligence) and big data,&quot; said SangJoon Hwang, executive vice president of DRAM product &amp; technology at Samsung Electronics. 

32 Gb memory dies not only enable Samsung to build a regular, single-rank 32 GB module for client PCs using only eight single-die memory chips, but they also allow for higher capacity DIMMs that were not previously possible. We are talking about 1 TB memory modules using 40 8-Hi 3DS memory stacks based on eight 32 Gb memory devices. Such modules may sound overkill, but for artificial intelligence (AI), Big Data, and database servers, more DRAM capacity can easily be put to good use. Eventually, 1TB RDIMMs would allow for up to 12 TB of memory in a single socket server (e.g. AMD&#x27;s EPYC 9004 platform), something that cannot be done now.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: AMD last week announced what are probably the last major GPU launches of this generation of graphics cards: the $449 Radeon RX 7700 XT and $499 Radeon RX 7800 XT. AMD&#x27;s pricing and performance numbers pit the cards against Nvidia&#x27;s GeForce RTX 4060 Ti (specifically the $499 16GB version) and the $599 RTX 4070. AMD&#x27;s pricing is aggressive enough that Nvidia is quietly cutting the prices of some 16GB RTX 4060 Ti cards to $449, to match the RX 7700 XT. 

The announcement about the $50 reduction was buried toward the bottom of an email that Nvidia sent to GPU reviewers ahead of AMD&#x27;s launch next week; it also drew attention to Nvidia-specific features like DLSS upscaling and frame generation, which compete with AMD&#x27;s GPU-agnostic FSR, plus recent DLSS improvements that improve ray-tracing performance.

                              <span>Hot on the heels of its lunar landing success, India is readying to blast a probe even deeper into space to study the sun. From a report: The country&#x27;s first solar observation mission, named Aditya-L1, is set to be launched from India&#x27;s main spaceport on Sriharikota, an island off the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, at 11:50 a.m. local time on Saturday. The spacecraft is scheduled to spend 125 days traveling 1.5 million kilometers (932,000 miles) to its destination, a point in space where objects stay put and consume less fuel. 

While arriving there would be an impressive achievement for ISRO, the Indian space agency, Aditya-L1 would have gone just a fraction of the 150 million km between Earth and the sun. For ISRO, success would be another major feat after India became the first country to land a spacecraft close to the lunar south pole in August. India has more ambitious projects in the works. A human spaceflight program aims to launch astronauts into orbit for the first time possibly by 2025, ISRO Chairman S Somanath said in an interview with news agency Asian News International. ISRO and NASA plan to cooperate on sending astronauts to the International Space Station and India is in discussions with Japan to work together on a mission.

                              <span>The centenary of the Great Kanto earthquake brings angst, and lessons for the world. From a report: Every year on September 1st, Japan&#x27;s ministers trek by foot to the prime minister&#x27;s office to take part in a crisis simulation. Across the country, local officials and schoolchildren drill for disasters. The date marks the Great Kanto earthquake, a 7.9-magnitude tremor that struck near the capital back in 1923. The ensuing disaster killed at least 105,000 people, including around 70,000 in Tokyo itself, destroyed 370,000 homes and changed the course of Japanese history. 

This year&#x27;s centenary of the disaster has occasioned much commemoration -- and angst. What will happen when the next Big One hits? Seismologists cannot predict earthquakes, but their statistical models, which are based on past patterns, can estimate the likelihood of one. The city government&#x27;s experts reckon there is a 70% chance of a magnitude 7 or higher quake hitting the capital within the next 30 years. Far fewer people will probably die than during the disaster in 1923, thanks to better technology and planning: the worst case foresees some 6,000 deaths in the city. But millions of lives will be upended. 

Another, similarly likely scenario could be much worse. A Nankai Trough earthquake, envisaged south of Kansai, Japan&#x27;s industrial heartland, could trigger a tsunami; as many as 323,000 might be killed, according to an official estimate. Japan&#x27;s approach to the risks of such catastrophes offers insights for a warming world facing more frequent disasters. Quakes of this size could &quot;challenge the survival of Japan as a state&quot; and send economic shock waves around the globe, says Fukuwa Nobuo of Nagoya University. After the next Tokyo quake, recovering basic city functions could take weeks and rebuilding the capital could take years; direct damage alone could run to as much as $75bn. One piece of research estimates that gdp would dip by 11% following a Nankai earthquake.

                              <span>Spotify is cracking down on white-noise podcasters, reducing the advertising support for programmers that provide little more than soothing sounds like rain or chirping birds. From a report: In an email to creators Friday, the company highlighted changes to its Ambassador Ads program -- promotional spots for Spotify that podcasters read. The company pays hosts to read ads to encourage more creators to make shows and join the platform. As part of the change taking effect Oct. 1, white noise podcasters will no longer be eligible for such support, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The company is also raising the audience threshold that conventional podcasters must meet to qualify for those ads to 1,000 unique Spotify listeners over the past 60 days from 100.

                              <span>The theft of IT equipment and data, as well as digital and industrial espionage and sabotage, will cost Germany 206 billion euros ($224 billion) in 2023, German digital association Bitkom said on Friday. From a report: The damage will surpass the 200 billion euro mark for the third consecutive year, according to a Bitkom survey of more than 1,000 companies. &quot;The German economy is a highly attractive target for criminals and hostile states. The boundaries between organised crime and state-controlled actors are blurred,&quot; Bitkom President Ralf Wintergerst said. Around three quarters of the companies surveyed suffered digital attacks in the past 12 months, falling from 84% of the companies in the previous year.

                              <span>Hundreds of people who participated in a recent Tough Mudder event -- a very muddy obstacle course race -- held in Sonoma, California, have fallen ill with pustular rashes, lesions, fever, flu-like symptoms, nerve pain, and other symptoms, local health officials and media outlets report. From a report: The cases could be caused by various infectious agents, including Staphylococcus bacteria, but the leading culprit is the relatively obscure Aeromonas bacteria -- specifically A. hydrophila, according to the Sonoma County health department. In a statewide alert this week, the California Department of Public Health said it is considering it an Aeromonas outbreak, noting that multiple wound cultures have yielded the hardy bacterium. 

A spokesperson for the Sonoma County health department told the Los Angeles Times on Thursday that, based on calls and emails the department had received, health officials estimate that the outbreak involves around 300 cases. Tough Mudder participants, meanwhile, have tallied as many as 489 cases in online forums. The Tough Mudder event was held at the Sonoma Raceway on August 19 and 20, 2023, with symptoms of infection developing in cases within 12 to 48 hours afterward. The Sonoma County health department advisory noted that the race &quot;involved extensive skin exposure to mud&quot; and that participants with a rash, fever, or other symptoms should go to their health care provider or, if no provider is available, to a local emergency department.

                              <span>Dell and Samsung are the latest beneficiaries of the current frenzy of speculation surrounding anything AI related, with both vendors seeing a rise in share prices related to their future AI prospects. From a report: Shares in Dell were said to be up 8 percent in extended trading following the Round Rock company releasing its results for the second quarter of its financial year 2024. These showed that revenue was $22.9 billion, down 13 percent on the same period last year. However, this figure was also up 10 percent on the previous quarter, with the company attributing this growth to rising demand for AI-optimized servers, as well as its PowerStore and PowerFlex storage systems. AI accounted for 20 percent of server revenue in the first half of the year, Dell said. 

Similarly, Dell said it is seeing growth in demand for its workstations designed to help organizations run complex AI workloads locally, with its commercial client revenue hitting $10.6 billion. This accounted for the lion&#x27;s share of the Client Solutions Group second quarter revenue of $12.9 billion, which was down 16 percent year-on-year but up 8 percent on the last quarter. Dell vice chairman and chief operating officer Jeff Clarke said that the company continued to focus on the most profitable segments of the market where he claimed Dell has a leading position.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Paris became the first European capital to outlaw the vehicles on Friday, following a vote in April in which Parisiens overwhelmingly supported a ban, although turnout was low. Privately owned e-scooters, which the city cannot regulate, are exempt. Since their eruption onto the streets and sidewalks of cities across the world in 2019, e-scooters have posed unique regulatory problems for city officials. The vehicles often stayed in legal limbo as officials mapped out charters for e-scooter operators, capped fleets and regulated parking. 

Cities like San Francisco and Miami temporarily banned e-scooters before reintroducing them. Santa Monica, Calif., successfully sued an e-scooter operator over its lack of licensing. And New York delayed the vehicles&#x27; arrival, citing security concerns. But no city has been as strict as Paris, where e-scooter users are mourning a cheap and flexible way of getting around without having to ride the crammed metro or use Velib&#x27;, the popular but frequently overwhelmed bike-sharing system.

                              <span>Supermarket giant Lidl has issued a recall of Paw Patrol snacks after the website listed on the products&#x27; packaging began displaying explicit content unsuitable for children. From a report: Lidl, which operates more than 12,000 stores globally, is urging shoppers in the United Kingdom to return the snacks for a full refund. Affected products include Paw Patrol Yummy Bakes and Paw Patrol Mini Biscotti, snacks recommended for children aged two and above. Lidl&#x27;s recall notice dated August 22 warns that the product&#x27;s packaging contains a web address that has been &quot;compromised&quot; to display content &quot;not suitable for child consumption.&quot;

                              <span>According to Bloombeg&#x27;s Mark Gurman (paywalled), Apple is experimenting with a new 3D-printing manufacturing process for some device production, starting with the upcoming Apple Watch Series 9 models. MacRumors reports: The new manufacturing process that Apple is testing would use less material than the large slabs of metal that are needed for traditional CNC manufacturing, plus it would cut down on the time that it takes to make new devices. With a technique called &quot;binder jetting,&quot; Apple is able to print a device&#x27;s outline at close to its actual shape using a powdered substance. A second process uses heat and pressure to squeeze the material into a substance that feels like steel, and it is then refined with milling.
 
Gurman&#x27;s information echoes what we&#x27;ve already heard from Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Back in July, Kuo said that the upcoming second-generation Apple Watch Ultra will include 3D printed mechanical parts. Specifically, he claimed that Apple is &quot;actively adopting 3D printing technology,&quot; and that some of the titanium components in the new Apple Watch Ultra would be 3D printed. Gurman claims that Apple plans to use this new 3D printing method for the chassis of the stainless steel Apple Watch Series 9 models rather than components for the Ultra but either way, it sounds like Apple is more actively testing this manufacturing method as of 2023. Gurman says that Apple plans to 3D print titanium devices in 2024. The report notes that the shift to 3D printing would also &quot;allow Apple to improve manufacturing times and potentially cut down on costs.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from UploadVR: Magic Leap 1 AR headsets will &#x27;cease to function&#x27; from December 31, 2024, the company announced. Magic Leap 1 launched in mid 2018 as the first transparent AR headset marketed and sold to consumers. The headset is powered by a tethered waist-mounted compute pack and came with a single tracked controller, though it got hand tracking support too. Content for the device included avatar chat, a floating web browser, a Wayfair app for seeing how furniture might look in your room, two games made by Insomniac Games, and a Spotify background app.
 
But Magic Leap 1&#x27;s eye-watering $2300 price and the limitations of transparent optics (even today) meant it reportedly fell significantly short of sales expectations. Transparent AR currently provides a much smaller field of view than the opaque display systems of VR-style headsets, despite costing significantly more. And Magic Leap 1&#x27;s form factor wasn&#x27;t suitable for outdoor use, so it didn&#x27;t provide the out-of-home functionality AR glasses promise to one day like on-foot navigation, translation, and contextual information. The Information reported that Magic Leap&#x27;s founder, the CEO at the time, originally expected it to sell over one million units in the first year. In reality it reportedly sold just 6000 units in the first six months.

                              <span>When things aren&#x27;t going well with a new hire, the problem usually falls into one of two categories: competency or engagement. If it&#x27;s a problem with engagement – their style of collaboration, their communication, their approach – there&#x27;s a good chance you can fix it with some clear feedback. But if the problem is with core competency – their technical skills – you can&#x27;t expect to solve that with a stern conversation.
It&#x27;s true that it might not be entirely clear in the early days of a new hire whether problems fall into one category or the other. But eventually it will be clear, and when it is, you have to act accordingly. 
Problems with engagement are often simply due to unstated assumptions. You expect someone to act a certain way, but they don&#x27;t realize that, so they don&#x27;t, and you&#x27;re …</span>

But despite Chef&#x27;s success, Adam constantly battled self-doubt and finding his footing as a leader. 
 In this raw episode, Adam shares how the pressure of going from sysadmin to startup CEO caused an identity crisis. He opens up about the motivational speech that left him in tears, realizing his self-worth was too tied to Chef&#x27;s outcomes.

The crates were immediately yanked and the user account locked, and the crates were then fully removed from the crates.io file store on August 18.
Phylum have also written their own blog on this incident.

These crates contained malicious build.rs files that would attempt to send metadata from the user&#x27;s computer to a Telegram2 channel, including their operating system, IP address, and geolocation information based on their IP address.3
One version of one crate also contained a copy of the PuTTY4 installer, with the build.rs spawning PuTTY instead of sending metadata to Telegram. Our assumption is that this was a…</span>

                              <span>An autonomous, artificial-intelligence-powered drone called Swift has beaten humanity&#x27;s best drone racers. &quot;The AI-equipped drone, developed by researchers at the University of Zurich, came out on top in 15 out of 25 races and recorded the single fastest lap time,&quot; reports Gizmodo. The findings have been published in the journal Nature. From the report: Swift beat the humans in the niche but growing sport of first-person view drone racing. Human competitors navigate using a headset connected to a camera on their drones to pilot a quadcopter through complex obstacle courses at extreme speeds, with the goal of finishing the race with the fastest time and avoiding taking too much damage in the process. Drones in these races can top 50 miles per hour when they&#x27;re really buzzing. The [video her…</span>

                              <span>According to a new report by The Wall Street Journal, mobile carriers including Verizon, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile are all requiring customers to switch to a debit card or bank account withdrawal in order to receive an autopay discount on their plan. Verizon has included this requirement for years, but in the past few months the other two carriers have quietly added it too. The Verge reports: The new rule goes into effect for AT&amp;T customers on October 2nd, and as a gesture of goodwill, the company will only reduce your discount if you continue to pay with a credit card. Those who register for autopay with a bank or debit card will receive $10 off; a credit card will only get you $5. T-Mobile&#x27;s change went into effect in July, also eliminating Apple Pay and Google Pay as methods eligible for the $5 discount. Oh, and technically, you can qualify for Verizon&#x27;s autopay discount with a credit card -- it just has to be a Verizon Visa card.
 
AT&amp;T and T-Mobile aren&#x27;t just making this a requirement for new customers -- the change is being applied to all postpaid accounts. Even if you&#x27;ve been receiving the discount for years with a credit card, you&#x27;ll have to make the switch in order to keep your discount. And it adds up -- the discounts are applied for each line on your plan, so if your whole family is on the same plan, it&#x27;s a significant amount of money.

US District Judge David Alan Ezra granted a preliminary injunction temporarily blocking enforcement after the Free Speech Coalition (FSC) joined adult performers and sites like Pornhub in a lawsuit opposing the law. Today, they convinced Ezra that Texas&#x27; law violates the First Amendment and would have &quot;a chilling effect on legally-protected speech,&quot; FSC said in a press release.

                              <span>UK&#x27;s Home Office is looking to increase its use of controversial facial recognition technologies to track and find criminals within policing and other security agencies. From a report: In a document released on Wednesday, the government outlined its ambitions to potentially deploy new biometric systems nationally over the next 12 to 18 months. The move comes after privacy campaigners and independent academics criticised the technology for being inaccurate and biased, particularly against darker-skinned people. 

MPs have previously called for a moratorium on its use on the general population until clear laws are established by parliament. The government is calling for submissions from companies for technologies that &quot;can resolve identity using facial features and landmarks,&quot; including for live facial recognition which involves screening the general public for specific individuals on police watch lists. 

In particular, the Home Office is highlighting its interest in novel artificial intelligence technologies that could process facial data efficiently to identify individuals, and software that could be integrated with existing technologies deployed by the department and with CCTV cameras. Facial recognition software has been used by South Wales Police and London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police over the past five years across multiple trials in public spaces including shopping centres, during events such as the Notting Hill Carnival and, more recently, during the coronation.

                              <span>To date, Google has processed more than seven billion copyright takedown requests for its search engine. The majority of the reported links are purged from Google&#x27;s search index, as required by the DMCA. Recently, however, Google appears to gone a step further, using search takedowns to &quot;moderate&quot; users&#x27; privately saved links collections. TorrentFreak: A few hours ago, Eddie Roosenmaallen shared an email from Google, notifying him that a link had been removed from his Google Saved collection because it violates Google&#x27;s policy. The reason cited for the removal is the &quot;downstream impact,&quot; as the URL in question is &quot;blocked by Google Search.&quot; 

&quot;The following saved item in one of your collections was determined to violate Google&#x27;s policy. As a result, the item will be moderated..,&quot; Google writes, pointing out a defunct KickassTorrents domain as the problem. Initially, it was suggested that this removal impacted Google&#x27;s synched Chrome bookmarks but further research reveals that&#x27;s not the case. Instead, the removals apply to Google&#x27;s saved feature. This Google service allows users to save and organize links, similar to what Pinterest does. These link collections can be private or shared with third parties.

                              <span>The US Copyright Office is opening a public comment period around AI and copyright issues beginning August 30th as the agency figures out how to approach the subject. From a report: As announced [PDF] in the Federal Register, the agency wants to answer three main questions: how AI models should use copyrighted data in training; whether AI-generated material can be copyrighted even without a human involved; and how copyright liability would work with AI. It also wants comments around AI possibly violating publicity rights but noted these are not technically copyright issues. The Copyright Office said if AI does mimic voices, likenesses, or art styles, it may impact state-mandated rules around publicity and unfair competition laws. Written comments are due on October 18th, and replies must be submitted to the Copyright Office by November 15th. 

The copyright status of AI training data and the output of generative AI tools has become a hot topic for politicians, artists, authors, and even civil rights groups, making it a potential testing ground for coming AI regulation. The Copyright Office says that &quot;over the past several years, the Office has begun to receive applications to register works containing AI-generated material.&quot; It may use the comments to inform how it decides to grant copyright in the future. The Copyright Office was involved in a lawsuit last year after it refused to grant Stephen Thaler rights to an image created by an AI platform. Earlier this month, a Washington, DC, court sided with the US Copyright Office in the case, stating copyright has never been handed to any work without a human involved.

                              <span>The stakes are high for Bethesda&#x27;s newest role-playing game. Microsoft needs an Xbox hit, and players are hungry for an expansive and satisfying space adventure. From a report: Starfield almost immediately nudges its players to the edges of the cosmos. In the opening hours of the role-playing video game, it&#x27;s possible to land your spaceship on Earth&#x27;s moon or zip 16 light-years to Alpha Centauri. When you open your map and zoom out from a planet, you can behold its surrounding solar system; zoom out again, and you&#x27;re scrolling past luminous stars and the mysterious worlds that orbit them. That sprawling celestial journey within Starfield, developed by Bethesda Game Studios, reveals both the tremendous potential and the monumental challenge of an open-world space adventure. Bethesda has hyped an expansive single-player campaign with 1,000 explorable planets. And expectations around the game, officially releasing on Sept. 6 after a 10-month delay, are nearly as vast. 

It&#x27;s the first new universe in 25 years for Bethesda, known for the Elder Scrolls and Fallout series. It&#x27;s also a high-stakes moment for Microsoft, which makes the Xbox and has long faced criticism that it produces fewer hit games than its console rivals, Sony and Nintendo. To compete, Microsoft went on a spending spree, acquiring Bethesda&#x27;s parent company in 2020 and agreeing to purchase Activision Blizzard in 2022, a $69 billion bet that is being challenged by regulators. Now Bethesda must deliver. Known for letting players navigate competing factions and undertake eccentric quests, the studio hopes Starfield will dazzle those clamoring for engaging encounters with alien life-forms or space mercenaries as well as a sense of boundless exploration.

                              <span>The latest version of the flagship FOSS browser is out, and it&#x27;s picked up one of the main features for which we keep Chrome around. From a report: The Firefox version 117 feature list might not look all that impressive, but it does have a big-ticket feature that may tempt people back: automatic translation. The snag is it&#x27;s disabled by default in the release version, and you&#x27;ll have to manually enable it. Although it was enabled in the betas, Mozilla has decided to go for a staged rollout and not enable it for everyone until Firefox 118 in six weeks or so. 

The new feature is integrated, privacy-respecting machine translation between multiple languages. This was already possible in older versions, but it needed an extension, and that had two side effects. One is that the extension hooked deep into the core of the browser in ways that Mozilla wasn&#x27;t comfortable about, and the other is that once your text had been sent out to a third-party website, it could be snooped upon -- but the victims of any snooping would blame the browser, even if it wasn&#x27;t the browser&#x27;s fault. To enable it, go to the configuration page (enter about:config in the address bar), and search for a setting called browser.translations.enable.

                              <span>Researchers say they have found fake apps in Google Play that masqueraded as legitimate ones for the Signal and Telegram messaging platforms. The malicious apps could pull messages or other sensitive information from legitimate accounts when users took certain actions. ArsTechnica: An app with the name Signal Plus Messenger was available on Play for nine months and had been downloaded from Play roughly 100 times before Google took it down last April after being tipped off by security firm ESET. It was also available in the Samsung app store and on signalplus[.]org, a dedicated website mimicking the official Signal.org. An app calling itself FlyGram, meanwhile, was created by the same threat actor and was available through the same three channels. Google removed it from Play in 2021. Both apps remain available in the Samsung store. 

Both apps were built on open source code available from Signal and Telegram. Interwoven into that code was an espionage tool tracked as BadBazaar. The Trojan has been linked to a China-aligned hacking group tracked as GREF. BadBazaar has been used previously to target Uyghurs and other Turkic ethnic minorities. The FlyGram malware was also shared in a Uyghur Telegram group, further aligning it to previous targeting by the BadBazaar malware family. Signal Plus could monitor sent and received messages and contacts if people connected their infected device to their legitimate Signal number, as is normal when someone first installs Signal on their device. Doing so caused the malicious app to send a host of private information to the attacker, including the device IMEI number, phone number, MAC address, operator details, location data, Wi-Fi information, emails for Google accounts, contact list, and a PIN used to transfer texts in the event one was set up by the user.

                              <span>The organization that represents the literary works of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard has filed a petition with the Federal Government, asking it to make it illegal to circumvent software locks for the repair of a highly specific set of electronic devices, according to a letter reviewed by 404 Media. From the report: The letter doesn&#x27;t refer to any single device, but experts say the petition covers Scientology&#x27;s &quot;E-Meter,&quot; a &quot;religious artifact&quot; and electronic that is core to Scientology. Author Services Inc., a group &quot;representing the literary, theatrical, and musical works of L. Ron Hubbard,&quot; told the U.S. Copyright Office that it opposes the renewal of an exemption to Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act that makes it legal for consumers to hack their personal electronics for the purposes of repair. 

This exemption to copyright law is needed because many electronics manufacturers put arbitrary software locks, Digital Rights Management systems, or other technological prevention measures that stop consumers from diagnosing or repairing devices unless they are authorized to do so. Special exemptions to copyright law make it legal for farmers to hack past John Deere&#x27;s DRM to fix their tractors, consumers to use software tools to help them repair certain parts of game consoles, or use third-party software to circumvent repair locks on printers, air conditioners, laptops, etc.

                              <span>VanMoof, the Dutch e-bike maker that gained a zealous following but declared bankruptcy last month, has been acquired by Lavoie, an upscale electric scooter company, the firms announced on Thursday. From a report: Riders of the expensive and technologically advanced VanMoof bikes were left in limbo by the company&#x27;s bankruptcy, because the machines are built from proprietary parts that only the company made and many of the bikes&#x27; functions are linked to a smartphone app that runs on the company&#x27;s servers. Despite the buzz around the brand, VanMoof had run into financial problems that led to a production backlog and monthslong waits for sales and repairs. 

But riders will not be completely out of limbo under the new ownership. &quot;What they can&#x27;t expect in the first couple of weeks is definitive answers to the problems,&quot; said Nick Fry, the chairman of McLaren Applied, the British motorsports technology company that owns Lavoie. The price of the acquisition was not disclosed, but Mr. Fry said Lavoie would spend &quot;tens of millions&quot; on the transaction as well as in investments over the coming months to &quot;rectify some of the challenges we face.&quot; He said, &quot;this is not going to be a walk in the park. This is going to be a challenge.&quot; One of the new owner&#x27;s priorities, he added, was improving the availability of parts and repairs, something that had become increasingly difficult for VanMoof owners. Regular bike shops could not -- or sometimes would not -- fix the bikes.

                              <span>A tiny island in the Caribbean is now sitting on a digital treasure. From a report: Anguilla, a tropical British territory, is known for its coral reefs and white sand beaches. Since the 1990s, however, it&#x27;s also been in charge of assigning internet addresses that end in .ai to residents and businesses looking to register websites. It was one of hundreds of country-specific domain names and easy to overlook -- until recently. Stability.ai, Elon Musk&#x27;s X.ai and Character.ai are just a few of the hot artificial intelligence startups that have snapped up the .ai domain assigned to the islands and cays that comprise Anguilla. Plenty of tech giants have their own web addresses ending in .ai as well: Google.ai and Facebook.ai route visitors to their company&#x27;s AI-focused webpages and Microsoft.ai shows off the company&#x27;s Azure AI services. 

The total number of registrations of sites ending with these two letters has effectively doubled in the past year to 287,432, according to Vince Cate, who for decades has managed the .ai domain for Anguilla. Cate estimates Anguilla will bring in as much as $30 million in domain-registration fees for 2023. Once one of the many obscure top-level domains assigned to countries and territories, .ai websites experienced a slow but steady increase in demand in recent years. But the sudden spike in .ai domains nine months ago highlights the broader frenzy around artificial intelligence and its ripple effects throughout the global economy. Since ChatGPT launched, a growing number of tech companies have raced to raise billions in capital, scoop up engineering talent and secure powerful but increasingly scarce chips. A domain may sound less essential, but for an industry obsessed with clever branding, the right name can be everything. &quot;Since November 30, things are very different here,&quot; Cate said, referring to the date when ChatGPT launched publicly.

                              <span>Activision has partnered with a company called Modulate to moderate voice chats using an AI technology called ToxMod. According to The Verge, the tool &quot;will work to identify behaviors like hate speech, discrimination, and harassment in real time.&quot; From the report: ToxMod&#x27;s initial beta rollout in North America begins today. It&#x27;s active within Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II and Call of Duty: Warzone. A &quot;full worldwide release&quot; (it does not include Asia, the press release notes) will follow on November 10th with the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, this year&#x27;s new entry in the franchise. Modulate&#x27;s press release doesn&#x27;t include too many details about how exactly ToxMod works. Its website notes that the tool &quot;triages voice chat to flag bad behavior, analyzes the nuances of each conversation to determine toxicity, and enables moderators to quickly respond to each incident by supplying relevant and accurate context.&quot;
 
The company&#x27;s CEO said in a recent interview that the tool aims to go beyond mere transcription; it takes factors like a player&#x27;s emotions and volume into context as well in order to differentiate harmful statements from playful ones. It is noteworthy that the tool (for now, at least) will not actually take action against players based on its data but will merely submit reports to Activision&#x27;s moderators.

The judgement against Mohammed bin Nasser al-Ghamdi, seen Wednesday by The Associated Press, comes against the backdrop of doctoral student Salma al-Shehab and others facing decades-long prison sentences over their comments online. The sentences appear part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman&#x27;s wider effort to stamp out any defiance in the kingdom as he pursues massive building projects and other diplomatic deals to raise his profile globally.

Nitpicking in pull requests reviews means offering insight that looks excessive, pedantic, and unimportant. It’s a pejorative term. I don’t question there are cases where the term applies, but many folks assimilate it to paying attention to the small stuff. By projecting all these negative connotations, this practice suddenly becomes undesirable: mind the big picture or leave the pull request alone. With that, we disagree. Small stuff when writing code matters, a lot.


Names matter
Naming things is a usual suspect when illustrating nitpicking. It’s also the example I have the hardest time swallowing. With the importance of names to make code understandable, how can anyone consider discussing those superfluous?

                              <span>Microsoft is discontinuing Visual Studio for Mac, committing to security updates and platform update compatibility for the next 12 months. 9to5Mac reports: &quot;With today&#x27;s announcement, we&#x27;re redirecting our resources and focus to enhance Visual Studio and VS Code, optimizing them for cross-platform development,&quot; the company said in the announcement.
&quot;No new framework, runtime, or language support will be added to Visual Studio for Mac.&quot; The company added: &quot;We will also continue to provide runtime and workload updates so you can continue building and shipping applications built on .NET 6, .NET 7, and the Mono frameworks. While not officially supported, we&#x27;ve also enabled rudimentary support for .NET 8 in Visual Studio for Mac for building and debugging applications.&quot;
 
Once the wheels fall off Visual Studio for Mac, Microsoft recommends accessing its IDE through Windows in a machine virtual on the Mac or in the cloud. Otherwise, Microsoft points to cross-platform compatible developer technology that will run on macOS: &quot;The recently announced C# Dev Kit, .NET MAUI, and Unity Extensions for VS Code are available in preview and are intended to augment VS Code&#x27;s capabilities for .NET and C# developers. These extensions operate natively across all supported platforms, including macOS, and the experience using these will continue to be improved as they move from preview to GA and beyond.&quot;

If I had kept monitoring this person, I would have figured out the subway station they often start a journey at, which is near where they live. I would also know what specific time this person may go to the subway each day. During all this monitoring, I wasn&#x27;t anywhere near the rider. I didn&#x27;t even need to see them with my own eyes.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from NPR: The Environmental Protection Agency removed federal protections for a majority of the country&#x27;s wetlands on Tuesday to comply with a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling. The EPA and Department of the Army announced a final rule amending the definition of protected &quot;waters of the United States&quot; in light of the decision in Sackett v. EPA in May, which narrowed the scope of the Clean Water Act and the agency&#x27;s power to regulate waterways and wetlands. A 2006 Supreme Court decision determined that wetlands would be protected if they had a &quot;significant nexus&quot; to major waterways. This year&#x27;s court decision undid that standard. The EPA&#x27;s new rule &quot;removes the significant nexus test from consideration when identifying tributaries and other waters as federally protected,&quot; the agency said.
 
In May, Justice Samuel Alito said the navigable U.S. waters regulated by the EPA under the Clean Water Act do not include many previously regulated wetlands. Writing the court&#x27;s decision, he said the law includes only streams, oceans, rivers and lakes, and wetlands with a &quot;continuous surface connection to those bodies.&quot; The EPA said the rule will take effect immediately. &quot;The agencies are issuing this amendment to the 2023 rule expeditiously -- three months after the Supreme Court decision -- to provide clarity and a path forward consistent with the ruling,&quot; the agency said. As a result of the rule change, protections for many waterways and wetlands will now fall to states.

                              <span>The Federal Communications Commission yesterday rejected requests to eliminate an upcoming requirement that Internet service providers list all of their monthly fees. From a report: Five major trade groups representing US broadband providers petitioned the FCC in January to scrap the requirement before it takes effect. In June, Comcast told the FCC that the listing-every-fee rule &quot;impose[s] significant administrative burdens and unnecessary complexity in complying with the broadband label requirements.&quot; The five trade groups kept up the pressure earlier this month in a meeting with FCC officials and in a filing that complained that listing every fee is too hard. The FCC refused to bend, announcing yesterday that the rules will take effect without any major changes. 

&quot;Every consumer needs transparent information when making decisions about what Internet service offering makes the most sense for their family or household. No one wants to be hit with charges they didn&#x27;t ask for or they did not expect,&quot; FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said. Yesterday&#x27;s order &quot;largely affirms the rules... while making some revisions and clarifications such as modifying provider record-keeping requirements when directing consumers to a label on an alternative sales channel and confirming that providers may state &#x27;taxes included&#x27; when their price already incorporates taxes,&quot; the FCC said.

                              <span>Hundreds of thousands of people are being forcibly engaged by organised criminal gangs into online criminality in Southeast Asia - from romance-investment scams and crypto fraud to illegal gambling - a report issued today by the UN Human Rights Office shows. From a report: Victims face a range of serious violations and abuses, including threats to their safety and security; and many have been subjected to torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, arbitrary detention, sexual violence, forced labour, and other human rights abuses, the report says. &quot;People who are coerced into working in these scamming operations endure inhumane treatment while being forced to carry out crimes. They are victims. They are not criminals,&quot; said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk. 

&quot;In continuing to call for justice for those who have been defrauded through online criminality, we must not forget that this complex phenomenon has two sets of victims.&quot; The enormity of online scam trafficking in Southeast Asia is difficult to estimate, the reports says, because of the clandestine nature and gaps in the official response. Credible sources indicate that at least 120,000 people across Myanmar may be held in situations where they are forced to carry out online scams, with estimates in Cambodia similarly at around 100,000. Other States in the region, including Lao PDR, the Philippines and Thailand, have also been identified as main countries of destination or transit where at least tens of thousands of people have been involved. The scam centres generate revenue amounting to billions of US dollars each year.

From a report: In OpenAI&#x27;s motion to dismiss (filed in both lawsuits), the company asked a US district court in California to toss all but one claim alleging direct copyright infringement, which OpenAI hopes to defeat at &quot;a later stage of the case.&quot; The authors&#x27; other claims -- alleging vicarious copyright infringement, violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), unfair competition, negligence, and unjust enrichment -- need to be &quot;trimmed&quot; from the lawsuits &quot;so that these cases do not proceed to d…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Microsoft employees were already expecting lackluster pay rises. In a company-wide email sent earlier this year, the tech company&#x27;s CEO Satya Nadella warned staff of salary freezes and cuts to the bonusbudget. But despite previous transparency around the cost-cutting measures, employees enquiring about how the budget cuts have impacted their performance review will now be fobbed off. According to leaked guidance, managers are being ordered to dodge such questions in the name of company culture. &quot;It&#x27;s natural for employees to ask questions about budget given the decisions shared in Satya&#x27;s email,&quot; the guidance reportedly states. &quot;However, it&#x27;s most important to focus discussions with direct reports on their impact for the past fiscal year and directly tie it to their rewards.&quot; 

Managers should not use the budget cuts as an &quot;explanation&quot; for compensation decisions for individual employees and instead should emphasize that the employee&#x27;s own &quot;impact&quot; determines &quot;rewards.&quot; &quot;Using budgets or factors besides the employee&#x27;s impact as an explanation for an employee&#x27;s rewards will erode trust and confidence within your team,&quot; the guide cautions. &quot;Reinforce that every year offers unique opportunity for impact, and we increase our high expectations, regardless of our budget.&quot;

                              <span>The word &quot;funga&quot; should be used alongside flora and fauna when discussing conservation issues to reflect the importance of fungi to ecosystem health, a UN body has said. From a report: The secretariat of the UN convention on biological diversity (UNCBD) said it was time that fungi were &quot;recognised and protected on an equal footing with animals and plants in legal conservation frameworks.&quot; 

&quot;Whenever referring to the macroscopic diversity of life on Earth, we should use &#x27;flora, fauna and funga,&#x27; and &#x27;animal, plants and fungi,&#x27;&quot; it said in an Instagram post. Mycologists, mostly from Latin America, established the term &quot;funga&quot; five years ago. It refers to the levels of diversity of fungi in any given place, and is analogous to &quot;flora and fauna,&quot; which refer to plants and animals. Unlike flora and fauna, it is not a Latin term but was chosen because it is morphologically similar. &quot;Just like mycelium, mycologically inclusive language will spread unseen but profound [sic], permeating public consciousness (and policy) to acknowledge fungi&#x27;s vital role in the grand web of life on and in Earth,&quot; it said.

                              <span>The European Union is stoking its power plants with fewer lumps of coal and barrels of oil and gas than it has ever recorded, data shows. From a report: The 27 member states burned 17% less fossil fuel to make electricity between January and June 2023 than over the same period the year before, a study from the clean energy thinktank Ember found. The EU made 410TWh of electricity from sources that release planet-heating gases, which analysts say is the lowest level since 2015 -- the first year for which they have monthly data -- and &quot;very likely&quot; since 2000. 

The drop in fossil fuel generation was driven by a fall in demand for electricity, as well as some growth in clean power, the study found. &quot;We&#x27;re glad to see fossil fuels down, but in the long-term it is not going to be sustainable to rely on the fall in demand to do this,&quot; said Matt Ewen, a data analyst at Ember and author of the report. &quot;We have to be replacing this energy rather than just expecting it to go away and not be used.&quot; To try to stop the planet heating, the EU has promised to cut greenhouse gas pollution by at least 55% from 1990 levels by the end of the decade, and hit net zero emissions by 2050. To get there, it will probably have to use less energy but more electricity than it does today, as more people heat homes and drive cars with electricity instead of fossil fuels.

From a report: During a pre-recorded internal Q&amp;A session earlier this month, Jassy told employees it was &quot;past the time to disagree and commit&quot; with the policy, which requires corporate employees to be in the office three days a week. The phrase &quot;disagree and commit&quot; is one of Amazon&#x27;s leadership principles, and was used often by the company&#x27;s founder and current executive chairman, Jeff Bezos. &quot;If you can&#x27;t disagree and commit, it&#x27;s probably not going to work out for you at Amazon,&quot; Jassy said, adding it wasn&#x27;t right for some employees to be in the office three days a week while others refuse to do so.

                              <span>A couple months after Microsoft revealed plans to increase Game Pass subscription prices, Sony is getting in on the act. From a report: The company is bumping up the annual prices of all three PlayStation Plus plans on September 6th. An annual Essential subscription will soon cost $80 per year, up from $60. The Extra plan is going up by $35 to $135 per year, while an annual Premium plan will soon cost $40 more at $160. The price changes won&#x27;t take effect for current PS Plus users on an annual plan until their next renewal date that&#x27;s on or after November 6th. If you make any changes to your plan between September 6th and then (such as changing tiers), the new pricing will apply. Sony has not announced changes to the monthly ($10 for Essential, $15 for Extra and $18 for Premium) or quarterly ($25 for Essential, $40 for Extra and $50 for Premium) for the time being. It notes that the annual plan is still less expensive than a monthly or quarterly subscription in the long run.

                              <span>An anonymous reader writes: I thought I had malware on my main Windows 11 machine this weekend. There I was minding my own business in Chrome before tabbing back to a game and wham a pop-up appeared asking me to switch my default search engine to Microsoft Bing in Chrome. Stunningly, Microsoft now thinks it&#x27;s ok to shove a pop-up in my face above my apps and games just because I dare to use Chrome instead of Microsoft Edge. This isn&#x27;t a normal notification, either. It didn&#x27;t appear in the notification center in Windows 11, nor is it connected to the part of Windows 11 that suggests new features to you. It&#x27;s quite literally a rogue executable file that has somehow appeared in c:\windows\temp\mubstemp and is digitally signed by Microsoft. 

&quot;We are aware of these reports and have paused this notification while we investigate and take appropriate action to address this unintended behavior,&quot; says Caitlin Roulston, director of communications, in a statement to The Verge. [...] This isn&#x27;t Microsoft&#x27;s first rodeo, either. I&#x27;m growing increasingly frustrated by the company&#x27;s methods of getting people to switch from Google and Chrome to Bing and Edge. Microsoft has been using a variety of prompts for years now, with pop-ups appearing inside Chrome, on the Windows taskbar, and elsewhere. Microsoft has even forced people into Edge after a Windows Update, and regularly presents a full-screen message to switch to Bing and Edge after updates.

                              <span>Replacing a sort algorithm in the FreeBSD kernel has improved its boot speed by a factor of 100 or more... and although it&#x27;s aimed at a micro-VM, the gains should benefit everyone. From a report: MicroVMs are a hot area of technology R&amp;D in the last half decade or so. The core idea is a re-invention of some of concepts and technology that IBM invented along with the hypervisor in the 1960s: designing OSes specifically to run as guests under another OS. This means building the OS specifically to run inside a VM, and to talk to resources provided by a specific hypervisor rather than to fake hardware. 

This means that the guest OS needs next to no support for real hardware, just VirtIO drivers which talk directly to facilities provided by the host hypervisor. In turn, the hypervisor doesn&#x27;t have to provide an emulated PCI bus, emulated power management, emulated graphics card, emulated network interface cards, and so on. The result is that the hypervisor itself can be much smaller and simpler. The result of ruthlessly chopping down both the hypervisor, and the OS that runs inside it, is that both ends can be much smaller and simpler. That means that VMs can use much fewer resources, and start up much quicker.

A close study of the extracted worm made clear why the diagnosis was so hard to pin down: the roundworm was one known to infect snakes -- specifically carpet pythons endemic to the area where the woman lived -- as well as the pythons&#x27; mammalian prey. The woman is thought to be the first reported human to ever have an infection with this snake-adapted worm, and it is the first time the worm has been found burrowing through a mammalian brain. …</span>

Engadget reports: Users of the spyware won&#x27;t get any new data from their targets. &quot;Because #fuckstalkerware,&quot; the hackers wrote in a note obtained by TechCrunch. The WebDetetive breach compromised more than 76,000 devices belonging to customers of the stalkerware, and more than 1.5 gigabytes of data freed from app&#x27;s servers, according to the hackers.
 
While TechCrunch did not independently confirm the deletion of victim&#x27;s data from the WebDetetive server, a cache of data shared by the hackers provided a look at what they were able to accomplish. TechCrunch also worked with a nonprofit that logs exposed datasets, DDoSecrets, to verify and analyze the information. Hackers obtained information on customers like IP addresses and devices that they targeted.

                              <span>According to DigiTimes, Apple will receive all TSMC&#x27;s first-generation 3-nanometer process chips this year for its upcoming devices. MacRumors reports: As early as May, Apple was known to have booked nearly 90% of the Taiwanese pure-play foundry for its upcoming next-gen devices. However, Apple is now projected to take 100% of TSMC&#x27;s capacity in 2023, due to delays in Intel&#x27;s wafer needs owing to later modifications to the company&#x27;s CPU platform design plans. Intel&#x27;s lack of orders means TSMC&#x27;s sales of 3nm chips will be significantly lower this year. While TSMC is still expected to experience significant growth in the fourth quarter as it starts mass producing 3nm chips for Apple&#x27;s needs, they too have been downgraded, according to DigiTimes&#x27; industry sources.
 
The report suggests TSMC&#x27;s 3nm process output may be reduced to 50,000-60,000 wafers monthly in the fourth quarter, down from the 80,000-100,000 units previously anticipated, due to a cutback in Apple&#x27;s orders. The current monthly output of TSMC&#x27;s 3nm process is estimated at approximately 65,000 wafers, the outlet&#x27;s sources said. Apple&#x27;s upcoming iPhone 15 Pro models are expected to feature the A17 Bionic processor, Apple&#x27;s first iPhone chip based on TSMC&#x27;s first-generation 3nm process, also known as N3B. The E3nm technology is said to deliver a 35% power efficiency improvement and 15% faster performance compared to 4nm, which was used to make the A16 Bionic chip for the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max.

                              <span>Today we are launching the process to elect new Project Directors to the Rust Foundation Board of Directors.
As we begin the process, we wanted to spend some time explaining the goals and procedures we will follow.
We will summarize everything here, but if you would like to you can read the official process documentation.
We ask all project members to begin working with their Leadership Council representative to nominate potential Project Directors. See the Candidate Gathering section for more details. Nominations are due by September 15, 2023.
What are Project Directors?
The Rust Foundation Board of Directors has five seats reserved for Project Directors.
These Project Directors serve as representatives of the Rust project itself on the Board.
Like all Directors, the Project Directors are…</span>

                              <span>ZDNet&#x27;s Steven Vaughan-Nichols shares what&#x27;s new in the release of Linux 6.5: The biggest news for servers -- and cloud Linux users -- is AMD Ryzen processors&#x27; P-State support. This support should mean better performance and power use across CPU cores. Intel Alder Lake CPUs have also received improved load balancing in a related development. RISC-V architecture fans will be pleased to find Linux now has Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) support. ACPI is used in Linux and other operating systems for power management. It&#x27;s vital for laptops and other battery-powered systems.
 
For better security, people using virtual machines or sandboxes based on Usermode Linux for testing, or running multiple versions of Linux at once, now have Landlock support. Landock is a Linux Security Module that enables applications to sandbox themselves by selecting access rights to directories. It&#x27;s designed to be used by unprivileged processes while following the system security policy. To make talking with the rest of the world easier, Linux 6.5 now supports USB 4v2. This new USB-C standard will support up to an eye-watering 120Gbps. And while we&#x27;re still getting used to Wi-Fi 6E, the Wi-Fi Alliance is already working on bringing us Wi-Fi 7. When Wi-Fi 7 arrives, with its theoretical maximum speed of 46Gbps, Linux will be ready. As usual, the new Linux has many more built-in audio and graphics drivers. The Bcachefs filesystem didn&#x27;t make it into Linux 6.5, notes Vaughan-Nichols. &quot;While the Bcachefs filesystem looks good, there&#x27;s been a lot of developers fighting about the development process. These personal arguments have led Torvalds to decide not to incorporate Bcachefs into Linux 6.5.&quot;
 
Linus Torvalds announced Linux 6.5&#x27;s delivery in a brief post on August 27.

                              <span>According to research firm Antenna, Netflix had 2.6 million gross subscriber additions in July. &quot;The company also saw the highest percentage of new sign-ups going to its advertising tier since the $7-a-month offering hit the market last November,&quot; reports Deadline. &quot;About 23% of new subscribers opted for the ad tier, a gain of four percentage points over June levels.&quot; From the report: The overall July gains represented a 26% downturn from June&#x27;s record-breaking numbers, but they still show momentum stretching back to the May 23 introduction of paid password sharing in the U.S. From May 24 to 27, Netflix had its four biggest single days of sign-ups in the four-and-a-half years since Antenna has began tracking its subscribers, outpacing even the 2020 Covid boom.
 
The new password scheme followed last fall&#x27;s debut of the cheaper, ad-supported subscription tier, with the combination of the two providing a potent boost. In the second quarter ending June 30, the company reported that it doubled projections by adding 5.9 million subscribers, reaching 238.3 million worldwide.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Sports leagues are urging the US to require &quot;instantaneous&quot; takedowns of pirated livestreams and new requirements for Internet service providers to block pirate websites. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 requires websites to &quot;expeditiously&quot; remove infringing material upon being notified of its existence. But pirated livestreams of sports events often aren&#x27;t taken down while the events are ongoing, said comments submitted last week by Ultimate Fighting Championship, the National Basketball Association, and National Football League.
 
The &quot;DMCA does not define &#x27;expeditiously,&#x27; and OSPs [online service providers] have exploited this ambiguity in the statutory language to delay removing content in response to takedown requests,…</span>

                              <span>The PC market is expected to return to growth in 2024, according to estimates from IDC analysts. From a report: Still, industry players might want to taper their enthusiasm. PC shipments are forecast to grow 3.7 percent year-on-year to hit 261.4 million units in 2024, putting them above 2018 levels, but not quite on par with 2019 demand. Meanwhile, 2023 is predicted to sink by 13.7 percent to 252 million units. Research manager Jitesh Ubrani called demand &quot;tepid at best&quot; and said 2023 will be the year with the &quot;greatest annual decline in consumer PC shipments since the category&#x27;s inception.&quot; 

IDC recognizes the market still faces challenges including &quot;concerns around the consumer market refresh cycle, businesses pushing device purchases forward, and education budgets that are not rebounding in many markets.&quot; Market hesitancy, as always, boils down to uncertainty. For one, processors are seeing what IDC called &quot;some of the biggest shifts in commercial PC history&quot; as AMD market share hit 11 percent in 2022 and Apple pulled in just over 5 percent that year. Apple device sales have been on a decline for multiple quarters now. Q1 2023 saw new Macs plummet more than 40 percent year-on-year, compared to an overall 25-30 percent among PC vendors. The quarter before that saw Apple shipments outperform the PC market as a whole, declining a mere 2.1 percent while other manufacturers experienced 37 percent reductions.

                              <span>The FBI said Tuesday that it has taken down a network of hacked devices responsible for extorting tens of millions of dollars from victims around the world. From a report: US officials described the network known as Qakbot as one of the most notorious &quot;botnets&quot; in the world, referring to computer networks that have been infected with malicious software so that they can be controlled remotely without the owner&#x27;s knowledge -- often to send phishing emails. These emails can in turn be used to hack into victims&#x27; computer systems, which attackers will hold for ransom. 

Qakbot was instrumental in enabling cyberattacks against businesses and critical services around the world, according to US officials, including hits on the San Bernardino County Sheriff&#x27;s Department and hospitals run by Prospect Medical Group. The latter resulted in the closure of emergency rooms and medical facilities across the US. US officials estimated that, since its creation in 2008, Qakbot had infected around 200,000 computers in the US and 700,000 globally.

                              <span>Google DeepMind has launched a new watermarking tool that labels whether images have been generated with AI. From a report: The tool, called SynthID, will initially be available only to users of Google&#x27;s AI image generator Imagen, which is hosted on Google Cloud&#x27;s machine learning platform Vertex. Users will be able to generate images using Imagen and then choose whether to add a watermark or not. The hope is that it could help people tell when AI-generated content is being passed off as real, or help protect copyright. [...] Traditionally images have been watermarked by adding a visible overlay onto them, or adding information into their metadata. But this method is &quot;brittle&quot; and the watermark can be lost when images are cropped, resized, or edited, says Pushmeet Kohli, vice president of research at Google DeepMind. 

SynthID is created using two neural networks. One takes the original image and produces another image that looks almost identical to it, but with some pixels subtly modified. This creates an embedded pattern that is invisible to the human eye. The second neural network can spot the pattern and will tell users whether it detects a watermark, suspects the image has a watermark, or finds that it doesn&#x27;t have a watermark. Kohli said SynthID is designed in a way that means the watermark can still be detected even if the image is screenshotted or edited -- for example, by rotating or resizing it.

                              <span>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has paved the way for bitcoin exchange-traded funds. From a report: On Tuesday, the court sided with Grayscale in a lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission which had denied the company&#x27;s application to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to an ETF. The decision could impact other companies that want to create bitcoin ETFs, like BlackRock and Fidelity. A spot bitcoin ETF would be traded through a traditional stock exchange, although the bitcoin would be held by a brokerage, and would allow investors to gain exposure to the world&#x27;s biggest cryptocurrency without having to own the coin themselves. Many crypto bulls believe that approval of a spot bitcoin ETF will lead to more mainstream institutional adoption. 

Bitcoin, ether and other major cap crypto coins surged on the news, and Coinbase, which is listed as the custodian partner in multiple spot bitcoin ETF applications, was up more than 14% on Tuesday. &quot;The Commission failed to adequately explain why it approved the listing of two bitcoin futures ETPs but not Grayscale&#x27;s proposed bitcoin ETP,&quot; the court said, referring to exchange-traded products. &quot;In the absence of a coherent explanation, this unlike regulatory treatment of like products is unlawful.&quot; Grayscale Investments, which manages the world&#x27;s biggest crypto fund, initiated its lawsuit against the SEC in June 2022 after the agency rejected its application to turn its flagship bitcoin fund, better known by its ticker GBTC, into an ETF. The company decided to pursue the ETF, which would be backed by bitcoin rather than bitcoin derivatives, after the SEC approved ProShares&#x27; futures-based bitcoin ETF in October 2021.

                              <span>Google is making some big changes to Google Chat, its answer to Slack and Microsoft Teams. The messaging app -- aka the product formerly known as hangouts -- is getting a new design, some features that will feel distinctly familiar to Slack and Teams users, and a lot of Google&#x27;s new Duet AI collaboration tools. From a report: Most of the new features are rolling out later this year and early next, but they add up to a much more useful and competitive Chat platform. Duet is the flagship new feature and potentially a reason for a lot of Workspace users to start using Chat. You can use Duet to search and ask questions about all your stuff in Drive and Gmail and summarize both documents and conversations. You&#x27;ll also be able to use AI-powered autocorrect in Chat, and thanks to Smart Reply, you might never have to manually talk to your co-workers again. You&#x27;ll be able to talk to Duet in a one-on-one chat or invoke it in a group chat or a space to help get stuff done. &quot;You essentially have a co-worker who has infinite memory and amazing recall at your fingertips,&quot; says Vamsee Jasti, Google&#x27;s product lead for Chat. 

Outside of the AI integrations, Chat is also getting a facelift. The app has, until now, looked like a fairly barebones messaging app, with a list of conversations on the left and the active chat on the right; now, it&#x27;s going to have a lot more going on. (And, yes, it will look a lot more like Slack and Teams.) There will be a new home view with all your recent conversations, plus dedicated ways to see all your starred conversations and mentions. For now, everything will be reverse-chronological, but Google says it plans to start more intelligently organizing and ordering things next year. The interface as a whole is getting a bit of cleanup, too, with larger buttons and aesthetics borrowed from Google&#x27;s Material You design language.

&quot;This is a request to expand the repair exemption for consumer electronic devices to include commercial industrial equipment such as automated building management systems and industrial equipment (i.e. soft serve ice cream machines and other industrial kitchen equipment),&quot; the proposal, written by right to repair group iFixit and the nonprofit Public Knowledge, says. In addition, iFixit got its hands on a Taylor ice cream machine and tore it down in an effort to determine why they are broken so damn often and published a new video showing the process of taking the machine apart and explaining why they&#x27;re always broken when you want fast food ice cream.

                              <span>When employees leave Google to join the artificial intelligence startup race, the search giant still has a way to benefit -- by keeping those former workers as cloud customers. From a report: More than half of venture-backed generative AI startups pay for Google&#x27;s cloud computing platform, Alphabet, Google&#x27;s parent company, said Tuesday. Of the startups valued at over $1 billion, 70% are Google Cloud customers, and about a third of those are helmed by former employees, including Anthropic, Character.ai and Cohere, the company said. That gives Google a way to extend its influence in the field even when it sheds talent. 

Google&#x27;s cloud unit, which reported a profit for the first time this year, has emerged as one of the company&#x27;s best bets for growth as its core search business matures. Google still trails Amazon&#x27;s AWS and Microsoft&#x27;s Azure in the market. But startups in the field of generative AI -- programs that can spin up images, text and video from simple prompts -- are increasingly turning to the company, said James Lee, Google Cloud&#x27;s general manager for startups and AI. &quot;We&#x27;re seeing strong momentum in our business, and we see Google Cloud as the preferred choice for startups building generative AI,&quot; Lee said in an interview. Google Cloud customers have the option to use AI models from Google itself as well as other companies, a degree of flexibility that appeals to startups, Lee said.

To help people make a decision, we do include some considerations and suggest
committing Cargo.lock as a starting point in their decision making.
To align with that starting point, cargo new will no longer ignore
Cargo.lock for libraries as of nightly-2023-08-24.
Regardless of what decision projects make, we encourage regular
testing against their latest dependencies.
Background
The old guidelines ensured libraries tested their latest dependencies which
helped us keep quality high within Rust&#x27;s package ecosystem by ensuring issues,
especially backwards compatibility issues,
were quickly found and ad…</span>

                              <span>As of today, Khionu Sybiern will no longer be the representative of the Moderation team on the
Leadership Council, and she is also stepping down from the Moderation Team entirely, for personal
reasons. She hopes to return to contributing in the future. Josh Gould will be joining the
Leadership Council as the Moderation Team representative.
We thank Khionu for her extensive time and incredibly important contributions to the Moderation
Team and the Leadership Council. We wish her the best, and that she returns to the Rust community
when she&#x27;s ready. We thank Josh for being able to fill the Leadership Council role and look forward
to working with them!
We had already begun working on growing the essential Moderation Team before; because of that and
Khio stepping down, we are also pleased to announce that Oliver Scherer (oli-obk) has joined the
Moderation Team. Please join us in welcoming Oli!</span>

                              <span>Having not heard any significant disagreement with the first set of proposed priorities,
we are moving ahead with forming subgroups that will work towards defining and
completing the work needed to drive these forward. We plan to re-assess
priorities regularly, but for now these are our main work items (in no
particular order). We have some initial volunteers who will be pushing these
initiatives forward, but for all of these we are also looking for support from
any interested people. Please reach out on Zulip in #council if
you&#x27;d like to help out with any of these in some capacity, or to the initial
volunteers called out here.
Establishing plans for how to strengthen the moderation team (i.e., 2 is not a sustainable number) and strengthen moderation policies.

Josh Gould is leading, with support from Eric Holk. Their top priority is finding additional moderators and forming a contingent moderator team.
Figuring out the &quot;shape&quot; of the Rust Project. The Leadership Council needs to reflect the will of the Rust Project so it is important to know who that includes.

Eric Huss is leading, with support from Jack Huey. They&#x27;re working on defining the initial set of priorities here now.
Documenting and improving processes for interaction with the Rust Foundation including formalising the role of project directors in this process (the trademark policy process may be part of this).

We are looking for someone to help lead this initiative, with support from Mark Rousskov and Ryan Levick, two of the current  project directors. One of the proposed first concrete deliverables might be working towards a path forward on the trademark issue, using that as a stepping stone to defining broader policies. We&#x27;re intentionally looking for someone not directly involved previously to help give an outside perspective as the lead.
Please reach out if you&#x27;re interested in helping!</span>

                              <span>When people talk about great teams, they&#x27;ll talk about hard work, trust, respect, looking out for one another, etc. All good things.
But there&#x27;s one quality amongst teammates on great teams that often goes unrecognized by all but the most astute organizational observers: Admiration.
Great teams are made of people who *admire* one another&#x27;s talents, skills, character, and contributions. Great teams are mutual admiration societies who get to work together.
Admiration is the critical, silent variable in the powerful formula that equals exceptional teamwork.

                              <span>The Rust team is happy to announce a new version of Rust, 1.72.0. Rust is a programming language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.
If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, you can get 1.72.0 with:
rustup update stable

If you don&#x27;t have it already, you can get rustup from the appropriate page on our website, and check out the detailed release notes for 1.72.0 on GitHub.
If you&#x27;d like to help us out by testing future releases, you might consider updating locally to use the beta channel (rustup default beta) or the nightly channel (rustup default nightly). Please report any bugs you might come across!

                              <span>Cargo will be changing the order of merged configuration arrays, and we are looking for people to help test this change and provide feedback.
When an array in Cargo&#x27;s configuration is defined in multiple places, the elements are merged together. The order that the elements were merged was inconsistent with how other configuration types were merged together, and was not working as expected.
The new merging order will match the precedence order of non-array configuration, with higher-precedence configuration being placed later in the array.
In the case of build.rustflags, this resolves the confusing situation where higher precedence flags (in a project&#x27;s config.toml) are overridden with lower precedence flags (in the global $CARGO_HOME, for example).

It&#x27;s been over three years since my last blog post. I think that
the website code started to feel like it had bitrotted, and so making new blog
posts became onerous. But I&#x27;ve taken the time to redo this website
using Zig, so it&#x27;s quite easy to add blog
posts now, and plus I added
dark mode.
Twitter
Over the past few years I amassed a healthy number of followers on Twitter by posting
screenshots, demos, and small progress updates for the Zig programming language. It
felt good to gain an audience and have my perspective and efforts weighed more heavily in
the court of public opinion.
However, I always knew that it would need to end. It&#x27;s not really possible to use Twitter
without at least a little bit of doomscrolling, and that activity took a toll on me emotional…</span>

     consumed by other software and thus without any user-interface. Such
     services are hard to demonstrate, as they effectively just dump pages of
     JSON. A demo front-end is a simple user-interface just used to
     manipulate such an API. Matteo Vaccari describes how and

                              <span>Having a robust digital talent strategy is a competitive advantage in
     today’s fiercely competitive market. This enables businesses to have the
     right talent and have the right competencies to meet current and future
     demand to meet business goals or to stay on track for digital
     transformation aspirations. Sarah Taraporewalla continues
     her article on how to create an integrated business and technology strategy
     by looking at questions raised by two strategic directions that

                              <span>Here is a new article in the bottlenecks of scaleups series, looking at
     resilience and observability. Startups tend to only address resilience when
     their systems are already down, often taking a very reactive approach. For
     a scaleup, excessive system downtime represents a significant
     bottleneck to the organization, both from the effort expended on
     restoring function and also from the impact of customer dissatisfaction.
     Punit Lad and Carl Nygard explain that to
     move past this, resilience needs to be built into the business objectives,
     which will influence the architecture, design, product management, and even
     governance of business systems.

This week, Layerform got to the front page for the first time too, and I got asked that question another bunch of times.


I decided to write this document explaining how to do it so I can send people a link now.
As a heads-up, there is only one hack: making something people want (to upvote).
Also, keep in mind this is all public information on how HackerNews works. There’s no magic here.
Make your title direct and specific. Get straight to the point. Generic or vague titles do not perform well. Salesy titles perform even worse. Don’t worry about adding some technical detail. Explain what you do precisely.

                              <span>At Thoughtworks, we are strong practitioners of Test Driven Development (TDD).
     Naturally this leads to the question of how generative AI can help with
     this technique. Paul Sobocinski writes a brief memo
     explaining how some of our teams have used TDD with GitHub
     Copilot. As ever, co-pilot can&#x27;t be relied on to fly the plane, but
     can suggest some useful ideas for the red and green steps. It isn&#x27;t
     very helpful for the all-important refactoring step.

       Stefansdottir complete their examination of how to overcome the
       bottleneck that costs impose on a scaleup. In this final installment,
       they look at how to review and govern the technology portfolio,
       optimize rates, and provide a general view of cost efficiency initiatives
       during the life-cycle of a scaleup.
