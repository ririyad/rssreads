                              <span>Having a robust digital talent strategy is a competitive advantage in
     today’s fiercely competitive market. This enables businesses to have the
     right talent and have the right competencies to meet current and future
     demand to meet business goals or to stay on track for digital
     transformation aspirations. Sarah Taraporewalla continues
     her article on how to create an integrated business and technology strategy
     by looking at questions raised by two strategic directions that

                              <span>Here is a new article in the bottlenecks of scaleups series, looking at
     resilience and observability. Startups tend to only address resilience when
     their systems are already down, often taking a very reactive approach. For
     a scaleup, excessive system downtime represents a significant
     bottleneck to the organization, both from the effort expended on
     restoring function and also from the impact of customer dissatisfaction.
     Punit Lad and Carl Nygard explain that to
     move past this, resilience needs to be built into the business objectives,
     which will influence the architecture, design, product management, and even
     governance of business systems.

This week, Layerform got to the front page for the first time too, and I got asked that question another bunch of times.


I decided to write this document explaining how to do it so I can send people a link now.
As a heads-up, there is only one hack: making something people want (to upvote).
Also, keep in mind this is all public information on how HackerNews works. There’s no magic here.
Make your title direct and specific. Get straight to the point. Generic or vague titles do not perform well. Salesy titles perform even worse. Don’t worry about adding some technical detail. Explain what you do precisely.

                              <span>At Thoughtworks, we are strong practitioners of Test Driven Development (TDD).
     Naturally this leads to the question of how generative AI can help with
     this technique. Paul Sobocinski writes a brief memo
     explaining how some of our teams have used TDD with GitHub
     Copilot. As ever, co-pilot can&#x27;t be relied on to fly the plane, but
     can suggest some useful ideas for the red and green steps. It isn&#x27;t
     very helpful for the all-important refactoring step.

                              <span>Any business that wants to grow needs to be built on strong and stable
     foundations. While these strategic directions are often familiar to
     technical folks it&#x27;s important that the improvements to engineering align
     with the themes that resonate with the rest of the organization.
     Sarah Taraporewalla illustrates how this appears with two
     strategic directions that consider improvements in efficiency and quality.

Concepts from functional programming
When people talk about functional programming, I think of a few key
choices you can make while programming:
Immutability by default
(Tail) recursion by default
First-class functions (and the suite of tools that go along with it. e.g. map, reduce/fold)
And if you have experience as a programmer, yo…</span>

                              <span>We are saddened today to learn of the passing of Stefan Tilkov. We’ve met Stefan several times at workshops and conferences and always enjoyed his good company and insightful views. He advocated many of the things that we and our colleagues support - and as well as skillfully explaining these ideas, he also backed them up with concrete experience from his work. We shall really miss his wise contributions online, and regret that we won’t get the chance to chat with him again. We offer our condolences to his family, friends, and colleagues at INNOQ.

                              <span>There is complex and there is difficult, they are not the same. 


Being able to run a marathon is very difficult. But what you have to do to prepare is simple. A small sheet of paper is enough to describe the steps. You will need tremendous effort and discipline - so it’s hard - but it is simple.


Software development is different: it is also complex.


A common theme in my articles on how we do Rails at 37signals is how facing software development with rigid recipes is naive and counterproductive. A good example is services: using a service for everything is a simple idea; applying domain-driven design and object orientation is not. Another manifestation is banning techniques because they can be harmful: concerns, accessing the database from models, callbacks, globals, etc. Ironically, the alternative critics usually recommend for those is using services.


In software, you must take a Babylonian body of knowledge, combine it with your own experience, and apply the result to make countless daily decisions. And of all this for a problem you can’t understand without solving it first. Rigidity doesn’t work, and – because this is a game of intricate complexity – it yields more harm than benefit. You need to embrace nuance.


Mind the recipes you follow.

                              <span>A great many smart people terminably hamper their ability to better understand the world by refusing to accept defeat when reality proves them wrong. Armed with an intellect that&#x27;s at once both too proud to recognize it&#x27;s own failings and cunningly capable of producing sophisticated excuses, they&#x27;re adapt at spotting this failing in others but not in themselves.
You see this all the time in the realm of public policy. Someone presents a plausible thesis on how to deal with a given problem. They drum up support for an attempt that follows their ideas, but when the attempt is defeated by reality, they can&#x27;t retreat, and become stuck trying to defend the path in ever-more creative yet ludicrous ways.

     strategic directions that are part of growing the business.
     Expanding into new customer segments can introduce new operational
     processes or channels. Inorganic growth (eg acquisitions and mergers) needs
     an understanding of the drivers of increased value and the long term
     expectation (eg merge or keep separate and divest) for the business unit.

                              <span>One of the most fascinating aspects of Tesla&#x27;s rise to dominance has been how they discarded many of the traditional values of car making. While the rest of the industry was stuck competing on the size of their panel gaps, and other aspects of precision and quality assembly, Tesla didn&#x27;t even show up to participate. Their cars are legendary for being delivered with shoddy paint jobs, rattling interiors, and even mismatched doors. But it just didn&#x27;t matter! Consumers voted with their wallets for poorly built EVs because well-built gas-powered cars were deemed irrelevant in comparison.
There&#x27;s tremendous wisdom for product makers of all kinds in this lesson. It&#x27;s the epitome of Blue Ocean Strategy. To find a breakthrough angle in commerce, it&#x27;s as important to decide where you will not compe…</span>

     to building technology strategy that challenges the convention. It starts
     by identifying the overall strategic directions that the organization is
     considering, and using common aspects of these directions to indicate the
     investigations needed for the organization to understand the technology
     implications raised by that strategic change. This first
     installment looks at two of these directions: expanding the business
     by creating complementary products, and expanding the business into new

                              <span>It&#x27;s hard not to see your spirits lifted when you&#x27;re part of bringing something to life. Be that a product, an organization, or a community, or all three at once. Like exercise, it&#x27;s one of those rare avenues of human endeavor that almost invariably will make anyone feel better. And, also like exercise, the hard part is getting started when you need it the most!
That&#x27;s the curious chasm between knowledge and action. As much as you may know that regular, high-intensity training of the body does wonders for the mind, summoning the motivation to follow through with a commitment to working out only gets harder and harder the more you need it. I&#x27;ve had periods in my life where being removed from meaningful acts of creation felt just the same way.
Those periods were especially depressing when they felt like a simulacra of creation. Being in a situation designed to mimic the motions of making, but bereft of any meaningful progress towards that end. The pretending of purpose. The appearance of collaboration. Without any thrust towards completion.
And just as how getting a positive streak of accomplishment going provides its own momentum to keep at it, so too does a negative streak of performative busyness. It pulls you back into the comfort of the mental couch, and hands you the bag of chips to soothe your nagging sense of uselessness. For every day you stay there, the harder it is to get up, so best to muster everything you got to escape the dulling inertia now.
Make something. Participate in something. Engage with someone. All of it might feel as unnatural as strapping on those running shoes after too long of a break, but once you&#x27;re back to creating, the energy comes by itself.</span>

                              <span>The corporate cause for return-to-office just claimed its perhaps most ironic victim: Zoom! The company that literally lives to sell us all on the wonders of remote collaboration wants its own people back into the office again. Which I guess is just a regression to the mean of productivity tool makers failing to believe their own marketing, but it&#x27;s a bit sad none the less.
Not the least because this push for return-to-office has now been proven completely safe for large tech corporations. Thanks to the mixture of mass layoffs earlier this year and the now numerous proclamations that remote-first is over at the majority of big companies. Safety in sentiment, safety in numbers.
This is an opportunistic squeeze, because what&#x27;s most tech workers supposed to do? The option of simply hopping to another company has been severely limited. Outside the small realm of AI experts, most other domains just aren&#x27;t anywhere nearly as contested in hiring as they once were. So this is happening now because it can happen now.
I just hope that people who really did enjoy that remote work-lifetyle don&#x27;t forget what it was like. The balance of power will presumably turn around one day again, and when it does, voting with your feet will be an option again.
Until then, I suspect that the likes of Shopify, Automattic, and other stalwart defenders of remote work will continue to see their openings become increasingly oversubscribed. Just like we&#x27;ve had at 37signals for going on two decades.
Remote work might be receding, but it&#x27;s simply too compelling an option for too many to ever disappear. The long-term trend line ain&#x27;t going anywhere.</span>

For the 6th year in a row, the Rust Project conducted a survey on the Rust programming language, with participation from project maintainers, contributors, and those generally interested in the future of Rust. This edition of the annual State of Rust Survey opened for submissions on December 5 and ran until December 22, 2022.
First, we&#x27;d like to thank you for your patience on these long delayed results. We hope to identify a more expedient and sustainable process going forward so that the results come out more quickly and have even more actionable insights for the community.
The goal of this survey is always to give our wider community a chance to express their opinions about the language we all love and help shape its future. We’re grateful to those of you who took the …</span>

Nobody describes it better than Richard Feynman:
In the South Seas there is a Cargo Cult of people.  During the war they saw airplanes land with lots of good materials, and they want the same thing to happen now.  So they’ve arranged to make things like runways, to put fires along the sides of the runways, to make a wooden hut for a man to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head like headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas — he’s the controller — and t…</span>

                              <span>Many software developers seem to have a uniquely hard time accepting that not everyone who just tries real hard will become so good as to be among the best in this field. That there really is a discrepancy of talent that leads to a discrepancy of competence. That not everyone can or will become equally good at this job.
In contrast, nobody seems to have trouble with the fact that not every soccer player who loves the game and trains their best will become eligible for the Premier League. Or that becoming a brain surgeon might indeed really be harder than making it as a general practitioner, which in itself is hard enough too!
But becoming a developer can happen without ever really having to face an adversarial examination of your skills. There&#x27;s no 90-minute clock that ends with a look at …</span>

                              <span>The Rust team has published a new point release of Rust, 1.71.1. Rust is a
programming language that is empowering everyone to build reliable and
efficient software.
If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, getting Rust
1.71.1 is as easy as:
rustup update stable

If you don&#x27;t have it already, you can get rustup from the
appropriate page on our website.
What&#x27;s in 1.71.1 stable
Rust 1.71.1 fixes Cargo not respecting the umask when extracting dependencies,
which could allow a local attacker to edit the cache of extracted source code
belonging to another local user, potentially executing code as another user.
This security vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2023-38497, and you can read
more about it on the advisory we published earlier today. We
recommend all users to update their toolchain as soon as possible.
Rust 1.71.1 also addresses several regressions introduced in Rust 1.71.0,
including bash completion being broken for users of Rustup, and the
suspicious_double_ref_op being emitted when calling borrow() even though it
shouldn&#x27;t.
You can find more detailed information on the specific regressions, and other
minor fixes, in the release notes.
Contributors to 1.71.1
Many people came together to create Rust 1.71.1. We couldn&#x27;t have done it
without all of you. Thanks!</span>

                              <span>This is a cross-post of the official security advisory. The
official advisory contains a signed version with our PGP key, as well.
The Rust Security Response WG was notified that Cargo did not respect the umask
when extracting crate archives on UNIX-like systems. If the user downloaded a
crate containing files writeable by any local user, another local user could
exploit this to change the source code compiled and executed by the current
user.
This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2023-38497.
Overview
In UNIX-like systems, each file has three sets of permissions: for the user
owning the file, for the group owning the file, and for all other local users.
The &quot;umask&quot; is configured on most systems to limit those permissions
during file creation, removing dangerous ones. For example, the de…</span>

 In this episode, we&#x27;ll follow that path. We&#x27;ll hear the stories of legends like Seymour Papert, who championed active, project-based learning. Of Fred Brooks, who discovered that pairing accelerates learning. And more. 
 The research shows that with the right methods, motivation, and support, anyone can master learning curves and summit. So join me as we uncover the science behind learning to code. You&#x27;ll walk away fired up, equipped with proven techniques to unlock your potential and conquer new technical skills. 
  
  The climb is on!

After two and a half years, we&#x27;ve decided its time to rotate the leadership again!
Welcome David Wood
Felix Klock is stepping down from his role as senior lead and David Wood is joining Wesley Wiser as the new junior lead for the team.
Felix remains a valued member of the compiler team (and also the language design team).
Felix will be focusing on reducing the sizes of Rust futures, and on improving the state of the art for authoring Unsafe Rust, via projects such as Krabcake.
David has been a contributor to the Rust project since 2017, a compiler-contributor since 2019 and became a compiler team member in 2021.
His contributions include work on the diagnostic translation effort, split DWARF support, polymorphisation, non-lexical lifetimes initiative and general maintenance to the compiler.
David has also been a contributor to the governance and organization of the compiler team itself via policy proposals and regular participation in our weekly triage and steering meetings.
Felix and I are excited to welcome David into this leadership role and I am thrilled to be working alongside him.</span>

Sacrificing purity for convenience is one of the Rails pillars. This principle informs several Rails features that some recommend avoiding but that we happily use in our apps. In this post, I’ll discuss how we use three of those in Basecamp.

I’ll show some examples involving projects. In Basecamp, a Bucket represents a top-level container of data, and there are several types of buckets, one of which is a Project. Internally, we implement this with delegated type attribute, where a Bucket has an associated Bucketable. A Bucket can contain many Events, and an Event is a holder for information on the related request, such as the IP or the transaction id (Event::Request) and some additional information (Event::Detail).

                              <span>As startups begin to grow rapidly, they often find that early decisions
     that helped them find a product/market fit lead to excessive costs once
     traffic increases. These costs can threaten a scaleup&#x27;s ability to grow.
     Sofia Tania and Stefania Stefansdottir have worked with
     many scaleups in this predicament and share their approach to understanding
     and reducing these costs.

     LLMs, this time by asking GitHub Copilot to write a median
     function. It gave her three suggestions to choose from. The
     experience shows you still have to know what you&#x27;re doing when asking LLMs
     to write code, since the LLM&#x27;s programming skills are often rather flawed.

     She&#x27;s decided to publish her exploration in a series of memos. The first
     memo looks at the current toolchain for LLMs, categorizing them by what
     tasks they help with, how we interact with the LLM, and where they come from.

                              <span>As more and more companies, especially large ones, have started demanding remote workers return to the office, the competitive hiring advantage for remote-first companies is back. And it&#x27;s even bigger than before the pandemic, now that so many workers have had a taste of what life can be like when you don&#x27;t have to commute to the office. This is great news for smaller companies and startups in particular.
Let&#x27;s face it, if you&#x27;re trying to compete for talent with the likes of Google or Apple, you need all the help you can get, and these companies forcing everyone back into an office might just be your biggest lift. Because for quite a few people, working remotely or not has become the defining characteristic of a job. To the point where many remote workers won&#x27;t even consider a position th…</span>

                              <span>Any large software effort, such as the software estate for a large
    company, requires a lot of people - and whenever you have a lot of people
    you have to figure out how to divide them into effective teams. Forming
    Business Capability Centric teams helps software efforts to
    be responsive to customers’ needs, but the range of skills required often
    overwhelms such teams. Team Topologies is a model
    for describing the organization of software development teams,
    developed by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais. It defines four forms
    of teams and three modes of team
    interactions. The model encourages healthy interactions that allow 
    business-capability centric teams to flourish in their task of providing a
    steady flow of valuable software.

                              <span>A two-pizza team is a small team
  that fully supports software for a particular business capability. The term
  became popular as it used to describe how Amazon organized their software staff.
The name suggests the most obvious aspect of such teams, their size. The
  name comes from the principle that the team should no larger than can be fed
  with two pizzas. (Although we are talking about American Pizzas here, which
  seemed alarmingly huge when I first encountered them over here.) Keeping a
  team small keeps it cohesive, forming tight working relationships. Typically I
  hear this means such teams are about 5-8 people, although my experience
  suggests that the upper limit is somewhere about 15.
Although the name focuses solely on the size, just as important is the

                              <span>After hiring people for twenty years, I&#x27;ve come to accept that it&#x27;s impossible to know up front what someone is truly capable of. Sure, we try our best to make good, educated guesses during the hiring process, and this is why asking finalists to do sample work projects is so crucial. But it still remains just guessing, and the truth doesn&#x27;t emerge until you afford the hire a full attempt on a real project.
That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m such a fan of starting new employees in the deep end. Putting them to work on a real project right away. But this is only half the commitment you ought to make to their potential.
It&#x27;s just as important to retain the possibility of rapid progression by continuing to test their promise against harder and bigger challenges. I can&#x27;t tell you the number of times I&#x27;ve been posi…</span>

It has been about a month since our first update so we wanted to share how it&#x27;s going and what we&#x27;re working on now.
Accomplishments so far
In our first post, we wrote:
In the coming weeks we will be establishing the basic infrastructure for the group, including creating a plan for regular meetings and a process for raising agenda items, setting up a team repository, and ultimately completing the transition from the former Rust leadership structures.
We have made progress on each of these things.
For the last month we have been holding weekly meetings and will continue to do so for at least the next month. In the long term,…</span>
