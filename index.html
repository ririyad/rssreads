                              <span>What an interesting moment.
We&#x27;re staring at two distinctly different visions of the future. They may co-exist, but they are radically different takes on what&#x27;s modern, what&#x27;s current, and where things are headed.
One vision gets the UI out of the way. The other vision is UI everywhere you look.
One vision gets the computer out of the way. The other vision mounts a computer on your face.
One vision is get it and go. One vision is get it and stay.
One vision fades into the background. The other vision is front and center.
One vision is about information. The other vision is about immersion.
One vision is natural and understands you. The other vision requires new methods of interaction that you have to learn and master.
One vision feels like an assist. One vision feels like obstruction.
One vision fits with whatever you already have. One vision requires you buy something that fits.
One vision is simply text. One vision is anything but.
One vision feels like before. One vision feels like after. But I&#x27;m not sure which is which.
Both are extraordinary.

                              <span>Imagine a problem you can&#x27;t understand without solving it first. The first time I saw software development described as a wicked problem was in Code Complete by Steve McConnell, and I haven&#x27;t seen anything but a constant validation of this proposition throughout my career. And it&#x27;s a paradoxical one with several counterintuitive corollaries. Here&#x27;s one: if you don&#x27;t understand what you need to build, you should start building it. And here&#x27;s another: sweating to build something just to hit the delete button is sometimes part of the process.


Writing and making code work is costly; thinking and discussing things in the abstract is cheap. Everything holds up on paper, but computers are picky. I don’t believe that LLMs – as revolutionary as they are – will change this imbalance soon. Spending…</span>

                              <span>Companies love to protect.
They protect their brand with trademarks and lawsuits. They protect their data and trade secrets with rules, policies, and NDAs. They protect their money with budgets, CFOs, and investments.
They guard so many things, but all too often they fail to protect what’s both most vulnerable and precious: their employees’ time and attention.
Companies spend their employees’ time and attention as if there was an infinite supply of both. As if they cost nothing. Yet employees’ time and attention are among the scarcest resources we have.
At 37signals, we see it as our top job to protect our employees’ time and attention. You can’t expect people to do great work if they don’t have a full day’s attention to devote to it. Partial attention is barely attention at all.

                              <span>Today, we meet Ben Dumke-von der Ehe, one of the early developers on the Stack Overflow team. 
 He was on the front lines as the platform transformed how programmers worked. And he embodies the spirit of Stack Overflow:  Its transparency, playfulness, and even some of its struggles to be as welcoming and friendly as it should be. 
  
 But you&#x27;ll see what I mean. 
  
 So stick around as Ben takes us on a journey through the building of Stack Overflow. Get ready for a candid inside look at the creation of a platform that would become an essential part of the developer community and the internet as we know it.

                              <span>When I went to school in the 80s and 90s, the communication between the institution and home was limited. Kids could bring home a flyer about some future event, they&#x27;d get their grades and remarks detailed in a little grey book, and once a year parents would come in for a chat with the teachers. That was basically it, and it was glorious.
In Denmark today, we have a centralized app used by all Danish public schools called Aula. Think of it as Facebook for teachers and parents. For our kid in an international school, there&#x27;s a similar system. All of it sucks. And I don&#x27;t mean in the way that the apps are poorly made, although that is typically also true, but in the way that adding IT to the parent-school relationship only made it worse.

                              <span>The world is full of talented, capable people who&#x27;d rather put their own efforts to direct use than manage others. But the natural inclination is to promote senior contributors up a managerial ladder, and out of the trenches. This often ends poorly, turning the promotion into a punishment.
It&#x27;s usually not that these potential managers don&#x27;t like working with others. Quite the contrary. I&#x27;ve found that nothing motivates ambitious people like working close together with other talented individuals. It&#x27;s also usually not that they&#x27;re uncomfortable being senior, in terms of setting a direction for the work. It&#x27;s that they don&#x27;t want the responsibility, and associated guilt, that comes with managing others. Especially when there&#x27;s a need for correction.

If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, you can get 1.70.0 with:
rustup update stable

If you don&#x27;t have it already, you can get rustup from the appropriate page on our website, and check out the detailed release notes for 1.70.0 on GitHub.
If you&#x27;d like to help us out by testing future releases, you might consider updating locally to use the beta channel (rustup default beta) or the nightly channel (rustup default nightly). Please report any bugs you might come across!
What&#x27;s in 1.70.0 stable
Sparse by default for crates.io
Cargo&#x27;s &quot;sparse&quot; protocol is now enabled by default for reading the index from crates.io.…</span>

This doesn&#x27;t mean leaving them all alone to figure out the culture, the work, and the people by themselves, mind you. Nobody hits the ground running, and everyone needs guidance and mentorship to thrive in a new situation. But it does mean that the context in which you offer that assistance ought to be real as quickly as possible.
For programmers at 37signals, for example, we assign both a buddy and a mentor to new hires. The buddy is solely there to be a friendly guide to the innards of the organization. Why do we do the things we do? The mentor is there…</span>

                              <span>Making data open and available to all helps us all understand our world
     and are thus better informed to shape the policies to run it. But such openness
     does come with problems - one in particular is the invasion of people&#x27;s
     privacy. Detailed census information about household income helps debate
     and planning for local government, but can reveal personal information that
     citizens reasonably prefer to keep private. Privacy Enhancing Technologies
     are tools that can finesse this problem. My colleague Katharine Jarmul is a
     data scientist who is also an activist for personal privacy. Here she
     introduces three of these tools that are usable now: Differential Privacy,
     Distributed &amp; Federated Analysis &amp; Learning, and Encrypted Computation.

                              <span>In all the years we ran 360 performance reviews – the employee assessment process where you solicit feedback from peers, reports, and manager – I can think of only once when it lead to a meaningful follow-up. The rest of the time, across hundreds of reviews, it was an arduous, awkward affair of forcing people to come up with novel ways to congratulate each other on command. Dropping these 360s was perhaps one of the most popular acts of minimizing management we&#x27;ve ever done at 37signals.
It should have been obvious that the 360 process wasn&#x27;t valuable because almost nobody wanted to do it. Getting folks to fill out their reviews required constant nagging, resulting in weeks-long procrastination. That is not the hallmark of a happy process that serves the interests of the people involved.

                              <span>On May 26th 2023, JeanHeyd Meneide announced they would not speak at RustConf 2023 anymore. They were invited to give a keynote at the conference, only to be told two weeks later the keynote would be demoted to a normal talk, due to a decision made within the Rust project leadership.
That decision was not right, and first off we want to publicly apologize for the harm we caused. We failed you JeanHeyd. The idea of downgrading a talk after the invitation was insulting, and nobody in leadership should have been willing to entertain it.
Everyone in leadership chat is still working to fully figure out everything that went wrong and how we can prevent all of this from happening again. That work is not finished yet. Still, we want to share some steps we are taking to reduce the risk of something…</span>

There&#x27;s just a special kind of magic that comes from being together, which Zoom will never match or catch. But what&#x27;s enabled the remote-work revolution to be effective is that these moments don&#x27;t need to happen every day, week, or even month. 
At 37signals, we&#x27;ve been doing company-wide meetups twice a year for over fifteen years. Through these meetups, we&#x27;ve secured the lion&#x27;s share of the social in-person benefits afforded by an office, while allowing nearly eighty people from twenty countries to collaborate happily and effectively. It&#x27;s remarkable how nourishing it can be simply to see your coworkers every six months, and then rely on those ful…</span>

                              <span>If you want to run a company that&#x27;s light on full-time managers, you have to focus on managing processes before people. The traditional paradigm of a reporting manager that&#x27;s constantly following up with their reports, conducting daily stand-up meetings, weekly 1-1s, and all other forms of intensive supervision, needs to be (mostly) replaced with an asynchronous, self-managing paradigm instead.
Let&#x27;s look at five ways that principle works in practice at 37signals. 
First, we&#x27;ve replaced the commonly used daily stand-up meetings with a set of automated questions in Basecamp. On Monday mornings, we ask everyone &quot;What are you going to work on this week?&quot;, and at the end of every day, we ask &quot;What did you work on today?&quot;. These two recurring questions provide the key process for keeping everyo…</span>

                              <span>As part of bringing myself up-to-speed after joining TigerBeetle, I
wanted some background on how distributed consensus and replicated state
machines protocols work. TigerBeetle uses Viewstamped
Replication. But I
wanted to understand all popular protocols and I decided to start with
Raft.
We&#x27;ll implement two key components of Raft in this post (leader
election and log replication). Around 1k lines of Go. It took me
around 7 months of sporadic studying to come to (what I hope is) an
understanding of the basics.
Disclaimer: I&#x27;m not an expert. My implementation isn&#x27;t yet hooked
up to Jepsen. I&#x27;ve run it
through a mix of
manual and
automated
tests and
it seems generally correct. This is not intended to be used in
production. It&#x27;s just for my education.

                              <span>As part of bringing myself up-to-speed after joining TigerBeetle, I
wanted some background on how distributed consensus and replicated state
machines protocols work. TigerBeetle uses Viewstamped
Replication. But I
wanted to understand all popular protocols and I decided to start with
Raft.
We&#x27;ll implement two key components of Raft in this post (leader
election and log replication). Around 1k lines of Go. It took me
around 7 months of sporadic studying to come to (what I hope is) an
understanding of the basics.
Disclaimer: I&#x27;m not an expert. My implementation isn&#x27;t yet hooked
up to Jepsen. I&#x27;ve run it
through a mix of
manual and
automated
tests and
it seems generally correct. This is not intended to be used in
production. It&#x27;s just for my education.

     instead we should focus how to have clearly separated modules with a simple

     in TypeScript, with a minimalist &quot;function-first&quot; approach, on a simple
     example application separating application logic from persistence.

That&#x27;s not to say that we never run these numbers, but it is to say that these numbers never run us. Because in the end, even the most sophisticated KPIs all inevitably serve the simplest calculations: Are we making money? Is it enough? You don&#x27;t need a degree in statistics to determine that.
Where this is most evident for us is in the product. I remember reading a story about how Google once tested 127 different shades of blue…</span>

Then, that masks – any masks! – would materially retard the spread. Later, that the vaccine would prevent you from getting the virus. Finally, that if you were vaccinated, you couldn&#x27;t spread the virus. All of that, and plenty more, turned out to be false.
In the years to come, there&#x27;ll be plenty of time to point fingers. Who, when, where. The main characters are already digging their rhetorical tunnels. 
But as we&#x27;ve passed the three-year anniversary for pandemic, I think it&#x27;s just as important to look inwards. Because not only did most people buy the false claims, they became little foot soldiers in the crusade for them. Including me, for a while.

                              <span>Recently I found that xref in Emacs had stopped working for me on my mac laptop. Today I finally tried to figure out what went wrong. xref is just a front-end, all the work is done by backends. It took a while for me to realize (ie remember) that I was using the excellent dumb-jump package as the backend. dumb-jump uses a range of fast search commands (such as ag and ripgrep) to detect references without using the awkward tags tables that Emacs used to rely on.
The command flow between xref and dumb-jump is difficult to follow, but looking at the dumb-jump customization page alerted me to dumb-jump having a debug option. With this enabled, I could see what command dumb-jump was sending to the operating system. By default it uses git grep while in a git repo (almost everything I do is in a git repo). Its git grep command is quite complex, using regexps to (I assume) get more sensible results. I tried out the command it issued in my own terminal and it failed to find anything, while a simple git grep worked fine.
Armed with a better knowledge of what was failing, I dug into dumb-jump’s issues and found Issue with git-grep. Reading that, I discovered that a change to git grep means that how git grep processes regexes differs depending on the operating system. This would mean that dumb-jump would need to detect git-grep’s version and the underlying OS to pick the right regexes for its search.
The fix for me is to force dumb-jump to use another searcher with (setq dumb-jump-force-searcher &#x27;rg). With that my xref commands worked again.</span>

But the smartest businesses — the ones that tend to stick around for the long haul — know that existence is also about avoidance.
Avoiding careening variable costs, avoiding getting involved with things that aren&#x27;t core to your business, avoiding spending time on things that don&#x27;t matter, avoiding bad investments, avoiding people who don&#x27;t help you prosper, and even avoiding customers who aren&#x27;t the right fit.
However, there&#x27;s something even more fundamental to avoid. It would be easy to call it &quot;complexity&quot; but that&#x27;s not quite it. Complexity can be necessary, and intricacy c…</span>

If you are an experienced software developer whose only exposure to
reddit is dank memes, proggit or even
language-specific subreddits like
/r/python, you&#x27;re missing out.
What follows are my favorite subreddits in tech. My criteria is that:
The subreddit topic is relevant to advancing as a programmer
Posts generally go into good depth
The comments stay on topic
And the shit-posting is minimal
This list isn&#x27;t hard to guess at if you consider advanced topics
in software. But I wanted to share because I think it&#x27;s worth
explicitly supporting high-quality subreddits.
/r/EmuDev
My favorite sub of all. Also has a phenomenal Discord group.
/r/ProgrammingLanguages
Focuses a little more on PLT topics (parsing techniques, syntax, type systems) than on compiling and interpreting techniques, but still good.
/r/DatabaseDevelopment
All about database internals, which ends up involving a bunch of
correctness and distributed systems stuff as well.
Disclosure: I run this sub. It&#x27;s at 2.7k+ members at time of publishing.
/r/ReverseEngineering
The largest subreddit on this list but still has pretty good posts.
/r/EsoLangs
One of the best/most fun intros to programming languages/compilers/interpreters is through languages like Brainfuck. This sub does a good job of keeping the fun going.
/r/Compilers
/r/GraphicsProgramming
While some language subreddits are pretty good, they are more so a
mixed bag than some of the topic-specific subreddits here. So they
don&#x27;t make my list, more on principle than anything else.
If there is a good one already, send me it!
What am I missing?
Am I missing other amazing subreddits? Just don&#x27;t say
language-specific ones. :)

It&#x27;s an incorrect meme IMO that tech Reddit is low-quality. You just have to find the interesting subreddits.

  included two books I don&#x27;t think are actually so worthwhile. This
  list is down to two. I think that&#x27;s a good thing actually.

These are the books I recommend to developers wanting to improve their
skills as professional programmers because of high information
density, believable premises/examples, and being well edited.
You don&#x27;t need to read books to improve as a developer but
they are unparalleled in quickly helping you gain depth in a subject.
High Performance Browser Networking
If you deal with networks, you would probably benefit from this book.
It is a thorough high level introduction to mobile networks, browser
network protocols, and fundementals of networking.
Designing Data-Intensive Applications
If you use a database (including an in-memory array of items you
search periodically) or if you build APIs, you would probably benefit
from this book. A solid introduction to distributed computing, data
transfer, indexing, etc.
That&#x27;s it!
Generic software books conspicuously not on this list for
me:
Clean Code
JavaScript the Good Parts
Design Patterns/Gang of Four
Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
A Philosophy of Software Design
They&#x27;re not all bad but give nowhere near as much return for the
investment of your time.

                              <span>There are many reasons to pick working for a bigger company in tech. The benefits, the pay, and, at least until recently, the job security. In many ways, it&#x27;s hard to argue with the cold logic of taking a seat on a star destroyer, if you can land one. But odds are you&#x27;ll be sitting on the bench if you do.
That is, your talents won&#x27;t get to play center stage in a way that really matters. If you weren&#x27;t there, there&#x27;d probably just be someone else to fill the slot, and it&#x27;d rarely make a big difference either way. That&#x27;s part of the resilience of a big ship, it&#x27;s built to withstand whatever the weather, so much of the crew is redundant by design.
That just isn&#x27;t so in a small boat. If you&#x27;re not rowing, everyone will notice. You can&#x27;t just rest and vest. You gotta play. That&#x27;s the appeal. You gotta play.
That can be intellectually exhausting, but it&#x27;s also the kind of flexing of your talents that make them grow rapidly. It&#x27;s the fact that others, and the boat as a whole, count on you being there that rewards you with meaning.
Would you rather be on the bench in the big leagues or playing every game with an underdog team moving up?</span>

                              <span>In the past I’ve written about how I used to be a hothead, reacting instantly to whatever I disagreed with. I didn’t even let someone finish their thought before I started forming my rebuttal. The remainder of their statement was just filler before I could slam back.
I’m far from perfect, and I still occasionally catch myself doing this today, but far less frequently. And when I do it, I spot it and correct for it. I’d say I’m 90% better.
Lately I’ve been using another tool to help create some space before I form an opinion. It’s a simple word called “yet”.
Over the past years I’ve found a lot of joy in things I’d normally have dismissed. And it’s all because of “yet”.
Instead of “I don’t like that color”, it’s “I don’t like that color… yet”. Instead of I don’t like that taste, it’s “I don…</span>

                              <span>Jason just penned a beautiful, succinct ode to the underdogs. Go read it.
It&#x27;s funny how finding just the right word unlocks the perfect mental image. We&#x27;ve often thought of ourselves as being in the corner of the small business, but that was never quite right. There are many kinds of small businesses, not all of them thinking of themselves as underdogs. But for the ones who do, those are our people.
What I love most about underdogs is how they can&#x27;t help having something on the line. As Nassim Taleb would say, they have skin in the game. And it&#x27;s incredible what kind of difference that makes. The easiest way to solve the agent-principle problem is to skip the agent, at least at the top.
That&#x27;s why &quot;small&quot; never really did capture our audience or our allegiance either. 37signals isn&#x27;t even technically a small business any more. We&#x27;re just under eighty people. We&#x27;ve got over a hundred thousand customers. We have cloud bills in the millions, and revenue many times that. But we sure as hell are underdogs. Fierce and feisty ones.
There&#x27;s a deep bond in that attitude. The people who connect the most with our writing, our books, our process, our tools, and our offerings usually share that underdog DNA. They might not always be as bold about it as we frequently are, but they&#x27;re thinking it, and they appreciate when we give those thoughts a strong voice in the public sphere.
As Jason writes, being an underdog is an ethos: Drive. Grit. Scrappiness. Independence. Those as the signals, but they&#x27;re also often dimmed by fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Are we going to make it? Will the big dogs eat our lunch? What&#x27;s the next move? Helping to allay those sentiments, and encouraging someone to keep on, is what continues to give me the spark to stick with it twenty years in.
Underdogs stick together. We&#x27;re making Basecamp for them.</span>

                              <span>What do they got?
A big team, lots of money, a strong brand, seemingly unlimited resources, panache, reputation, all that. They’re established.
They’re your competitors.
You want to look away, but you see them everywhere. Their ads on your social, their name in the media, your dream clients on their website.
But you know what else they got?
Bigger company bloat. Overflowing obligations. Narratives to uphold. Appearances to maintain. Entitlement. Too much overhead. 
They’re slow. They’re conservative. They talk too much. They’ve stopped taking risks. They’re resting on their laurels, gliding on their reputation. They’re on defense.
What they’ve really got is a lot to lose.
What do you got?
Hunger. Drive. Grit. Scrappiness. Independence. You’re on offense.
You don’t have enough, which is why you’re dangerous. You have no choice but to be clever and creative. To make up for what you don’t have with something they can’t have: The underdog spirit.
You can move. You can adjust. You can adapt. You can get it done while they’re still stuck deciding what to do.
Small is not a stepping stone. Small is not less than. It’s greater than. It’s faster than. It’s better than.
Savor your position. You don’t get to be the underdog forever. The baton will be passed. But for now, it’s your magic wand. Use it.
We stand with the underdogs.

                              <span>We&#x27;re letting our yearly commitment to Datadog, a performance and monitoring tool, expire at the end of this month. Not because we don&#x27;t like the service. It&#x27;s actually really nice! But because the $88,000/year it was going to cost us to continue is just ridiculous. And it&#x27;s emblematic of a larger issue: Enterprise SaaS pricing is getting silly.
But as silly as I thought our bill was going to be, there&#x27;s a Datadog customer paying $65 million for their services!! This came up on their most recent earnings call. It&#x27;s apparently a crypto company who &quot;optimized&quot; their bill by committing to this ludicrous spend:
  
      
        

  
At the risk of invoking a tired cliche, this kind of outlay for a performance and monitoring service sounds like a 0% interest rate phenomenon. There&#x27;s just no un…</span>

                              <span>Throw a dart on LinkedIn, or toss one into the ether on Twitter, and you&#x27;ll likely hit a post proclaiming that you better &quot;learn AI&quot; or you&#x27;re falling behind.
Master the tools and become a prompt engineer or someone else will tell the AI to summarize the long documents, kick off initial first drafts, and rewrite the headlines for you!
Nonsense.
This isn&#x27;t saying AI, ChatGPT, or whatever comes next is nonsense. It&#x27;s very real, very powerful, and very here.
But there&#x27;s nothing you need to learn, or do, right now, other than be curious. Play around, kick the tires, poke and prod. Get a feel for what this new sauce tastes like. Have fun, it&#x27;s not a test.
But become a master at once or you&#x27;re going to lose your job to some AI expert? Nah. That&#x27;s pure FUD. The stuff that everyone&#x27;s talking about is barely 6 months old — there are no experts, there are just people playing experts on the internet.
Besides, the best way to learn something is to need that something. Learning when you don&#x27;t really need to is a good way to give up early. Learning when there&#x27;s something you truly need to do, but can&#x27;t, but could, is the right time to figure something out.
They say necessity is the mother of invention, but it&#x27;s really the impetus for learning. The time will come, and you can figure it out then. If anything, it&#x27;ll be easier to learn how to use AI once it settles in a bit. Currently it&#x27;s a moving target.
So wait on it. Pop the pressure. Don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re falling behind. And don&#x27;t drop everything to dig in. Start curious, stay curious, know what it&#x27;s capable of, and, when the necessity strikes, figure it out. Until then, ignore the demands and focus on doing what you&#x27;re already good at.
