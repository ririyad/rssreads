                              <span>The rustup working group is happy to announce the release of rustup version 1.26.0. Rustup is the recommended tool to install Rust, a programming language that is empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.
If you have a previous version of rustup installed, getting rustup 1.26.0 is as easy as stopping any programs which may be using Rustup (e.g. closing your IDE) and running:
rustup self update

Rustup will also automatically update itself at the end of a normal toolchain update:
rustup update

If you don&#x27;t have it already, you can get rustup from the appropriate page on our website.

                              <span>The recent and rapid advance of AI has rightfully giving many in software real doubts about the future of their profession. I&#x27;d probably still wager that the fears are overstated – that we also got prematurely euphoric about the imminent prospects of self-driving cars – and that AI generating code is different from it evolving existing systems. But I wouldn&#x27;t want to bet the house on it. This might just be The Big One.
That uncertainty, whether we truly are on the cusp of a total transformation, is a surprising novelty to me, despite thirty years in software. We&#x27;ve been through so many breathless predictions about how this or that advancement in software would simply &quot;Change. Everything. Forever.&quot; that a certain pessimism would be perfectly reasonable.

                              <span>Yesterday I was speaking to a university class and, as it usually does, a question about innovation came up.


&quot;How do you stay innovative? How do you encourage innovative thinking at work?&quot;


My answer: You don&#x27;t stay innovative and you don&#x27;t encourage innovative thinking at work.


WHAT? Yes.


Innovation should almost never happen. It&#x27;s incredibly rare. It mostly happens by accident, not by intention. It&#x27;s wonderful when it does, but you merely fluctuate in and out of it, it&#x27;s not steady state.


Work is mostly mundane. It&#x27;s mostly maintenance. It&#x27;s mostly local improvement and iteration. Work is mostly... Work. Any innovation is an outlier, nearly a rounding error.


Even the most innovative projects or products are full of rote, prosaic stuff that still needs building. The poetic magic may be in the 5%, but the bulk of the work is in the other 95.


So I told the students they&#x27;d better get used to that. Work is not often very exciting, but it can absolutely be fulfilling. And you can be excited about that. But if you&#x27;re expecting breakthroughs all the time, riff sessions that constantly lead somewhere new, or brainstorms that shoot lightning, you&#x27;re going to be disappointed.


Yes innovation happens. Occasionally. Being happy at work is about finding challenge, reward, growth, and creative and intellectual stimulation in everything else.


Now... back to this new product we&#x27;re building.

     example of how he uses ChatGPT to help him code in a self-testing
     style. His initial prompt primes the LLM with an implementation strategy
     (chain of thought prompting). His prompt also asks for an implementation
     plan rather than code (general knowledge prompting). Once he has the plan
     he uses it to refine the implementation and generate useful sections of
     code.

For the past eight months, the Rust Foundation Project Directors have been working with the informal Trademark Working Group and the Foundation staff to draft an updated policy and FAQ for the Rust trademark. We&#x27;d like to provide some context around this work and address the community response to the feedback form for the recently circulated draft.
Background
Back when the Rust Foundation was created, one of the first things to happen was Mozilla transferring its ownership of the Rust trademark to the newly created foundation. An update to the existing policy was needed, and project leadership planned for this to be done together with the Foundation.
Since we wanted to incorporate community input to this policy and make it accessible as possible, the bo…</span>

                              <span>A friend of mine called. He was overwhelmed by a home renovation project that ballooned in size.
What started as a simple kitchen countertop replacement turned into more work in the kitchen, new lighting throughout the house, a master bathroom gut rehab, and new flooring in every room.
It became too much. He felt like he was sinking and he couldn&#x27;t find a grip to grab to prevent the downward spiral.
This was his first time managing so many things at once, along with living with the mess that&#x27;s inherent to demolition. Calm was hard to find, and clarity had left the building.
With genuine concern distorting his voice, he said &quot;I&#x27;m in a bad spot. What do I do?&quot;
So I asked him to give me a rundown on what was finished, and what was in progress. Essentially, step one is simply taking inventory.…</span>

                              <span>Our 2023 marketing campaign for Basecamp kicked off on a ton of different channels at once. Web ads, search ads, podcast ads, and TV ads all blasted the message of JUST LET ME DO MY JOB. Our flagship commercial was a hit with the audience and the critics. But our attempt at out-of-home advertising, with billboards all over Boston, was a bust at a $300,000 cost.


    
      
        

    
      
        

    
      
        

  

That&#x27;s advertisement! It&#x27;s hard to know what&#x27;s going to work unless you give it a go. And since we&#x27;re fighting competitors with one hand behind our back by refusing to use privacy-invasive ads targeted on personal data, we thought it was worth trying some more conventional channels, like billboards. But at least for software like Basecamp, it&#x27;s clear that isn&#x27;t likely to work.
It&#x27;s not that it did nothing. We did have 98 billboards all over Boston for about a month. But the effect was only barely measurable:
  
      
        

  
As you can see, we were at the top end of the predicted normal range, or even slightly above. But even with that, we ended up spending thousands of dollars on every attributable trial signup. Way outside the realm of anything we could claim a return on, even if you factored in a fair bit of long-run brand awareness.
I will say that it felt pretty cool to see the irreverent Basecamp marketing messages appear on building-hugging billboards. There was an emotionally gratifying return on the investment. And perhaps that explains why it used to be common to see business software advertised in places like San Francisco where a lot of executives of such companies could feel good about seeing them. There&#x27;s something gratifying about being in the real world like this.
But yeah, it didn&#x27;t work. We won&#x27;t be doing that again. But we&#x27;ll always have the pictures 😄</span>

Way to make an entrance!
This new conference will kick off at quite a momentous occasion, too: Celebrating the 20th anniversary of Ruby on Rails! I started working on the framework in the summer of 2003 as part of the development of Basecamp.

I vaguely remember doing a tour of our Chicago data center over a decade ago, but somewhere along the line, I just lost interest in the iron itself. Now the interest is back, because hardware is fun again, so let me share my excitement with you!
  
      
        

  
These are the two pallets that showed up in our Chicago data center recently. The same day that an identical set arrived in Ashburn, Virginia for our second data center. In total, we received twenty R7625 Dell servers that&#x27;ll power the bulk of our cloud exit. It&#x27;s a staggering amount of computing power in a shockingly small footprint.
Here&#x27;s a diagram of our four cabinets in Chicago (we have another four in Ashburn). As …</span>

Arlo has been instrumental in bringing Cargo&#x27;s new sparse registry support to fruition, which significantly improves registry performance. He has been involved with registry design and authentication discussions, and has been closely working with the team over the past year.
Scott has been very active in the past year, working on various parts of Cargo, namely implementing workspace inheritance. Since then, he has been helping with maintenance and designing new features.
With their help we now have capacity to start thinking about how feature development should be done moving forward. We are still in early discussions of processes for matching feature development with reviewer capacity, and will share more in the future. Thanks to Arlo and Scott for their help, and we are very much looking forward to having them as a part of the team!</span>

                              <span>Tim Urban&#x27;s new book What&#x27;s Our Problem? offers an excellent analysis of the current American political malaise. It breaks down the history of first how the Republican party got overrun by low-rung thinking from the mid-90s forward, then how equally low-rung thinking got the other side in the past decade or so. It&#x27;s a light, humorous recap of modern American political history. I highly recommend it.
It&#x27;s central contribution is adding a second dimension to the political spectrum. What we&#x27;re dealing with is not just far-left, left, center, right, far-right. That spectrum is about contesting &quot;what is&quot; and &quot;what ought to be&quot;. Our current problem is not so much disagreeing about those two central elements. All democracies will and should continue to do that. It&#x27;s how that disagreements manifes…</span>

                              <span>The product development process encompasses many moments. Moments of novel breakthrough, moments of mundane maintenance, and everything in between. But some of the most rewarding moments consistently come from making something simply useful.
Yesterday we shipped a feature in HEY called &quot;Reply to Everyone&quot; that was exactly that: Simply useful.
One of the things that makes something simply useful is a clear line from problem to solution. From hassle to effortlessness. From a lot of time to nearly no time at all. From creating work to eliminating work.
So let&#x27;s trace Reply to Everyone back to the initial germ of the idea.
It all started with frustration. This is a great place to start any feature. In fact, the closer you start to frustration, the more fuel you have to burn up the problem.

                              <span>Recent discussions with my colleagues showed that many software teams
     still run into trouble because they pack too much planned
     work into their iterations. Teams will usually run better when they have
     deliberate Slack, as it allows their delivery to be more predictable and
     gives them time to improve their environment.
While writing that bliki post, I also defined two styles of task
     planning in agile projects. Timeboxed Iterations are used to
     break up work into small chunks with a regular cadence to reassess the work
     and future plans. Using a little ceremony around allocating work to
     iterations helps make problems visible so that they can be dealt with
     properly. Continuous Flow
     dispenses with that ceremony, so skilled teams often prefer it.

                              <span>One of the most important techniques I&#x27;ve embraced for managing my time is to direct related tasks to a bucket, let that bucket accumulate until full, then empty it all in one go. This in contrast to trying to catch every task the moment it lands from the myriad of interruption pipes that&#x27;ll drip-drip-drip your day away if you let them. Nowhere is the most evident than with email.
I used to take such pride in inbox zero when I was still using Gmail. I&#x27;d check email continuously throughout the day, and I&#x27;d get back to almost everyone immediately. Whether it was urgent or not. Just so I could see that sweet zero. It felt very productive. It was not.
Every email is a drop, and every drop ripples the surface of your mind. It&#x27;s careless to let them hit without a filter. Your attention will have…</span>

Whether on guns or healthcare or taxes or any other major policy position that&#x27;s so fiercely contested in the US. Despite growing up in this little Nordic country, I didn&#x27;t fully appreciate the tremendous, underpinning power of a homogenous culture to fasten all these planks of a socially-democratic state – until I returned after 15 years Over There. I do now.
Denmark is a notoriously difficult country to integrate in. Not only because the language difficult, but because the people are too! I say this with all the love and respect of a Dane that continues to marvel at what a high-trust, high-coherence society these former Vikings have managed to construct. But it&#x27;s true.

                              <span>Last week I was talking with another business owner from a different industry. He was frustrated with an employee who kept asking him what to do if x, y, or z happens. This was a long-time employee who&#x27;d been in these situations before, not someone new who was learning the ropes.
With this particular employee, it&#x27;s always the same set of questions no matter the situation. It could be a call with a client. If could be a meeting with another department. It could be a conversation with a vendor. What if they bring this up...? What if they bring that up...? What should I say if they say...? What about if they...? Essentially this employee wanted to be prepared for every contingency in a given situation. And they were great when everything went as anticipated.
Being prepared sounds like a good …</span>

Musk has announced they&#x27;ll start reserving presence in the For You tab solely for paying customers from April 15th, limit participation in polls to just those customers, and soon also give preferential showing in replies as well. Legacy blue-checks will not be spared, and will in fact lose their old privileges. The price is the same for all. Bold!
All of the usual characters from the Musk Sucks Show are up in arms about this, of course. Something about how charging money for a service is a transgression against Musk&#x27;s allegiance to free speech, I think?

                              <span>The Rust team has published a new point release of Rust, 1.68.2. Rust is a
programming language that is empowering everyone to build reliable and
efficient software.
If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, you can get 1.68.2 with:
rustup update stable

If you don&#x27;t have it already, you can get rustup
from the appropriate page on our website, and check out the
detailed release notes for 1.68.2 on GitHub.
What&#x27;s in 1.68.2 stable
Rust 1.68.2 addresses GitHub&#x27;s recent rotation of their RSA SSH host
key, which
happened on March 24th 2023 after their previous key accidentally leaked:
GitHub&#x27;s RSA key bundled in Cargo has been
updated, to ensure systems
that haven&#x27;t interacted with GitHub yet won&#x27;t connect trusting the leaked
key.
The leaked key has been hardcoded as revoked in
Cargo, to ensure the key
won&#x27;t be used by Cargo even on systems that still trust the key.
Support for @revoked entries in
.ssh/known_hosts (along with
a better error message when the unsupported @cert-authority entries are used)
is also included in Rust 1.68.2, as that change was a pre-requisite for
backporting the hardcoded revocation.
If you cannot upgrade to Rust 1.68.2, we recommend following GitHub&#x27;s
instructions
on updating the trusted keys in your system. Note that the keys bundled in
Cargo are only used if no trusted key for github.com is found on the system.
Contributors to 1.68.2
Many people came together to create Rust 1.68.2. We couldn&#x27;t have done it
without all of you. Thanks!</span>
