Chinese spies exploited a couple of critical-severity bugs in F5 and ConnectWise equipment earlier this year to sell access to compromised U.S. defense organizations, UK government agencies, and hundreds of other entities, according to Mandiant. 

The Google-owned threat hunters said they assess, &quot;with moderate confidence,&quot; that a crew they track as UNC5174 was behind the exploitation of CVE-2023-46747, a 9.8-out-of-10-CVSS-rated remote code execution bug in the F5 BIG-IP Traffic Management User Interface, and CVE-2024-1709, a path traversal flaw in ConnectWise ScreenConnect that scored a perfect 10 out of 10 CVSS severity rating. 

UNC5174 uses the online persona Uteus, and has bragged about its links to China&#x27;s Ministry of State …</span>

                              <span>In an interview Saturday, CNN first asked Steve Wozniak about Apple&#x27;s &quot;walled garden&quot; approach — and whether there&#x27;s any disconnect between Apple&#x27;s stated interest in user security and privacy, and its own self-interest? 

Wozniak responded, &quot;I think there are things you can say on all sides of it.
&quot;I&#x27;m kind of glad for the protection that I have for my privacy and for you know not getting hacked as much. Apple does a better job than the others. 
And tracking you — tracking you is questionable, but my gosh, look at what we&#x27;re accusing TikTok of, and then go look at Facebook and Google... That&#x27;s how they make their business! I mean, Facebook was a great idea. But then they make all their money just by tracking you and advertising. 
And Apple doesn&#x27;t really do that as much. I consider Apple the good guy. 

So then CNN directly asked Wozniak&#x27;s opinion about the proposed ban on TikTok in the U.S.
 &quot;Well, one, I don&#x27;t understand it. I don&#x27;t see why. I mean, I get a lot of entertainment out of TikTok — and I avoid the social web. But I love to watch TikTok, even if it&#x27;s just for rescuing dog videos and stuff. 

And so I&#x27;m thinking, well, what are we saying? We&#x27;re saying &#x27;Oh, you might be tracked by the Chinese&#x27;. Well, they learned it from us. 
I mean, look, if you have a principle — a person should not be tracked without them knowing it? It&#x27;s kind of a privacy principle — I was a founder of the EFF. And if you have that principle, you apply it the same to every company, or every country. You don&#x27;t say, &#x27;Here&#x27;s one case where we&#x27;re going to outlaw an app, but we&#x27;re not going to do it in these other cases.&#x27; 

So I don&#x27;t like the hypocrisy. And that&#x27;s always obviously common from a political realm.

                              <span>Long-time Slashdot reader theodp writes: Among the amazing features of the in-process analytical database DuckDB, writes software engineer Paul Gross in DuckDB as the New jq, is that it has many data importers included without requiring extra dependencies. This means it can natively read and parse JSON as a database table, among many other formats. &quot;Once I learned DuckDB could read JSON files directly into memory,&quot; Gross explains, &quot;I realized that I could use it for many of the things where I&#x27;m currently using jq. In contrast to the complicated and custom jq syntax, I&#x27;m very familiar with SQL and use it almost daily.&quot; 

The stark difference of the two programming approaches to the same problem — terse-but-cryptic jq vs. more-straightforward-to-most SQL — also raises some interesting questions: Will the use of Generative AI coding assistants more firmly entrench the status quo of the existing programming paradigms on whose codebases it&#x27;s been trained? Or could it help bootstrap the acceptance of new, more approachable programming paradigms? 

Had something like ChatGPT been around back in the Programming Windows 95 days, might people have been content to use Copilot to generate reams of difficult-to-maintain-and-enhance Windows C code using models trained on the existing codebases instead of exploring easier approaches to Windows programming like Visual BASIC?

                              <span>&quot;Hollywood is bracing for another actors strike, this time against the videogame industry,&quot; according to MarketWatch:

&quot;We&#x27;re currently in bargaining with all the major game studios, and the major sticking point is AI,&quot; SAG-AFTRA National Executive Director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said Thursday. &quot;Actors at all levels are at risk of digital replication. We have strike authorization on that contract and it is, at this point — we could end up going on strike....&quot; 

The union, which navigated its way to a new film and TV contract after a 118-day strike against the Hollywood studios last year, is again focusing on regulating artificial intelligence and its impact on wages and jobs. &quot;It will be a recurring issue with each successive contract&quot; every three years, Crabtree-Ireland said.
 
Some studios are already using AI-generated voices to save money, the article points out. &quot;Actors and actresses should be very much afraid,&quot; Chris Mattmann, an adjunct research professor at the University of Southern California&#x27;s Computer Science Department, says in the article. &quot;Within three seconds, gen AI can effectively clone a voice.&quot; 


The strike could affect Microsoft&#x27;s Activision Publishing and Disney, as well as other major game publishers including Electronic Arts, Epic Games, and Warner Bros.

                              <span>&quot;It was three years of my, life you?&quot; a 93-year-old William Shatner tells the Guardian when asked about playing Captain Kirk on the original Star Trek series from 1967 to 1969:

It gladdens him to see how much joy the series has brought its many fans, but the richest rewards came in his introduction to science fiction, which activated and nurtured a lifelong curiosity about our species. He reminisces about meeting the great writers of the genre fondly yet frankly, honest enough to sort Ray Bradbury into &quot;the category right below friend, I think&quot;. He devoured their novels and developed a fascination with the principle of defamiliarization, that concepts taken for granted can be understood anew when viewed through the vantage of a stranger in a strange land. &quot;Good science fiction is humanity…</span>

                              <span>It was March 24, 1999 that The Matrix premiered, premembers the Wall Street Journal. &quot;To rewatch The Matrix is to be reminded of how primitive our technology was just 25 years ago. We see computers with bulky screens, cellphones with keypads and a once-ubiquitous feature of our society known as &#x27;pay phones,&#x27; central to the plot of the film.&quot; 

But the article&#x27;s headline warns that &quot;25 Years Later, We&#x27;re All Trapped in &#x27;The Matrix&#x27;&quot;.

[I]n a strange way, the film has become more relevant today than it was in 1999. With the rise of the smartphone and social media, genuine human interaction has dropped precipitously. Today many people, like Cypher, would rather spend their time in the imaginary realms offered by technology than engage in a genuine relationship with other human beings.

 Humane&#x27;s Ai Pin can even translate what you say, repeating it out loud in another language (with 50 different languages supported). And it can read you summaries of what&#x27;s on your favorite web sites, so &quot;You can just surf the web with your voice,&quot; according to a new video released this week. 

The video also shows it answering specific questions like &quot;What&#x27;s that song by 21 Savage with the violin intro?&quot; (And later, while the song is playing, answering more questions like &quot;This was sampled from another song. What song was that?&quot;) But then co-founder Imran Chaudhri — an iPhone designer and one of several former Apple employ…</span>

&quot;File-sharing services like Napster and LimeWire were just beginning to take off...

                              <span>There&#x27;s actually &quot;a global trend toward increased air safety,&quot; notes a Wall Street Journal columnist. 

And even in the case of the two fatal Boeing crashes five years ago, he stresses that they were &quot;were two different crashes,&quot; with the second happening only &quot;after Boeing and the FAA issued emergency directives instructing pilots how to compensate for Boeing&#x27;s poorly designed flight control software. 

&quot;The story should have ended after the first crash except the second set of pilots behaved in unexpected, unpredictable ways, flying a flyable Ethiopian Airlines jet into the ground.&quot;

Boeing is guilty of designing a fallible system and placing an undue burden on pilots. The evidence strongly suggests, however, that the Ethiopian crew was never required to master the simple remedy despite …</span>

But little did Pajitnov know that an engineer in charge of the game, Vedran Klanac, had kept a copy of it. Through the help of intermediaries, he showed it to Pajitnov and the two shared their memories of what happened to the lost game... 

Pajitnov has lived in the U.S. since 1991, where he has been involved in the development of games such as Pandora&#x27;s Box and worked with companies such as Microsoft and WildSnake Software...

In what may be an issue for Sun-obscuring strategies to combat global warming, it turns out that during solar eclipses, low level cumulus clouds rapidly disappear, reducing by a factor of 4, researchers have found.

The news comes from the science magazine Eos (published by the nonprofit organization of atmosphere/ocean/space scientists, the American Geophysical Union).


Victor J. H. Trees, a geoscientist at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, and his colleagues recently analyzed cloud cover data obtained during an annular eclipse in 2005, visible in parts of Europe and Africa.

According to their article, the attack &quot;can pair network services into an indefinite communication loop that creates large volumes of traffic.&quot;

Devised by researchers at the CISPA Helmholtz-Center for Information Security, the attack uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and impacts an estimated 300,000 host and their networks. The attack is possible due to a vulnerability, currently tracked as CVE-2024-2169, in the implementation of the UDP protocol, which is susceptible to IP spoofing and does not provide sufficient packet verification. An attacker exploiting the vulnerability creates a self-perpetuating mechanism that generates excessive traffic without limits and wit…</span>

Where things stand currently:

A U.K. court is currently considering whether to allow a last-ditch appeal by the 52-year-old.

And Slate calls it a &quot;downright transformative&quot; adaptation, &quot;jettisoning most of the novel&#x27;s characters and plucking scenes from all three books,&quot; while accusing it of &quot;making the trilogy&#x27;s expansive and philosophical story into something much more pedestrian and digestible.&quot;

Nurturing a growing fetus requires a series of profound physical, hormonal, and chemical changes that may rewire every major organ in the body and can cause serious health complications such as hypertension and preeclampsia. But does being pregnant actually take years off your life...? 


Today in Cell Metabolism, scientists report that the stress of pregnancy can cause a person&#x27;s biological age to increase by up to 2 years — a trend that may reverse itself in the months that follow. In some cases, the authors write, those who breastfeed their children after giving birth may end up biologically &quot;younger&quot; than during early pregnancy. The finding represents yet another piece of &quot;compelling&quot; evidence that events during and after pregnancy can have far-reaching health consequences, says Elizabeth Bertone-Johnson, an epidemiologist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who wasn&#x27;t involved in the new study... 

The discovery that biological aging isn&#x27;t necessarily a linear process &quot;came as a real surprise,&quot; says Kieran O&#x27;Donnell, a perinatal researcher at the Yale School of Medicine... But blood samples from 68 participants, collected 3 months after giving birth, revealed a dramatic about-face. Although being pregnant had initially aged their cells between 1 and 2 years, says O&#x27;Donnell, their biological age now appeared to be 3 to 8 years younger than it had been during early pregnancy — with different epigenetic clocks algorithms providing slightly bigger or smaller estimates.

The friendly reporter showed how the curl version bundled with macOS behaves differently than curl binaries built entirely from open source. Even when running the same curl version on the same macOS machine. 



The curl command line option --cacert provides a way for the user to say to curl that this is the exact set of CA certificates to trust when doing the following transfer.

                              <span>&quot;Microsoft confirmed that a memory leak introduced with the March 2024 Windows Server security updates is behind a widespread issue causing Windows domain controllers to crash,&quot; BleepingComputer reported Thursday. 

Friday Microsoft wrote that the issue &quot;was resolved in the out-of-band update KB5037422,&quot; only available via the Microsoft Update Catalog. (The update &quot;is not available from Windows Update and will not install automatically.&quot;) 

BleepingComputer reported the leak only affected &quot;enterprise systems using the impacted Windows Server platform,&quot; and home users were not affected. But Microsoft confirmed it impacted all domain controller servers with the latest Windows Server 2012 R2, 2016, 2019, and 2022 updates:


As BleepingComputer first reported on Wednesday and as many admins have warned over the last week, affected servers are freezing and restarting unexpectedly due to a Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process memory leak introduced with this month&#x27;s cumulative updates. 


&quot;Since installation of the March updates (Exchange as well as regular Windows Server updates) most of our DCs show constantly increasing lsass memory usage (until they die),&quot; one admin said. 


&quot;Our symptoms were ballooning memory usage on the lsass.exe process after installing KB5035855 (Server 2016) and KB5035857 (Server 2022) to the point that all physical and virtual memory was consumed and the machine hung,&quot; another Windows admin told BleepingComputer. 

The leak &quot;is observed when on-premises and cloud-based Active Directory Domain Controllers service Kerberos authentication requests,&quot; Microsoft wrote. &quot;Extreme memory leaks may cause LSASS to crash, which triggers an unscheduled reboot of underlying domain controllers...&quot; 

&quot;We strongly recommend you do not apply the March 2024 security update on DCs and install KB5037422 instead...&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Wired: Former president Donald Trump&#x27;sTruth Social, a shameless Twitter clone, is set to become a publicly traded company as soon as next week. Shareholders of Digital World Acquisition Corp. voted on Friday to merge with Trump Media and Technology Group, the company behind Truth Social. The vote is a culmination of a years-long saga attempting to merge Trump Media with a publicly traded company in what&#x27;s known as a SPAC deal. The company will trade under the ticker DJT once it goes public. [...] Truth Social looks nearly identical to Twitter, with some key distinctions. Instead of &quot;tweeting,&quot; users post a &quot;truth.&quot; A &quot;retweet&quot; is called a &quot;retruth.&quot; Unlike many right-wing Twitter clones, the site functions well, has remained mostly online, and actually appears to have a somewhat active user base. But since launching in February 2022, after Trump was kicked off of mainstream platforms for inciting violence during the January 6 riot at the Capitol, the company has been mired in controversy.

                              <span>An AI tool named Mia, tested by the NHS, successfully detected signs of breast cancer in 11 women which had been missed by human doctors. The BBC reports: The tool, called Mia, was piloted alongside NHS clinicians and analyzed the mammograms of over 10,000 women. Most of them were cancer-free, but it successfully flagged all of those with symptoms, as well as an extra 11 the doctors did not identify. At their earliest stages, cancers can be extremely small and hard to spot. The BBC saw Mia in action at NHS Grampian, where we were shown tumors that were practically invisible to the human eye. But, depending on their type, they can grow and spread rapidly.
 
Barbara was one of the 11 patients whose cancer was flagged by Mia but had not been spotted on her scan when it was studied by the hospital radiologists. Because her 6mm tumor was caught so early she had an operation but only needed five days of radiotherapy. Breast cancer patients with tumors which are smaller than 15mm when discovered have a 90% survival rate over the following five years. Barbara said she was pleased the treatment was much less invasive than that of her sister and mother, who had previously also battled the disease. Without the AI tool&#x27;s assistance, Barbara&#x27;s cancer would potentially not have been spotted until her next routine mammogram three years later. She had not experienced any noticeable symptoms. &quot;These results are encouraging and help to highlight the exciting potential AI presents for diagnostics. There is no question that real-life clinical radiologists are essential and irreplaceable, but a clinical radiologist using insights from validated AI tools will increasingly be a formidable force in patient care.&quot; said Dr Katharine Halliday, President of the Royal College of Radiologists.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from InterestingEngineering: A concept that began as a doodle at a conference years ago is now becoming a reality. RocketStar Inc. has showcased (PDF) its advanced nuclear-based propulsion technology called the FireStar Drive. It is said to be the world&#x27;s first electric device for spacecraft propulsion boosted by nuclear fusion. Recently, the company announced the successful initial demonstration of this electric propulsion technology.
 
The FireStar Drive harnesses the power of nuclear fusion to improve the performance of RocketStar&#x27;s &quot;water-fueled pulsed plasma thruster.&quot; A spacecraft&#x27;s thrusters perform various functions, including propulsion, orbital changes, and even docking with other orbiting platforms. Moreover, the device employs a unique sort of aneutronic nuclear fusion, which is a fusion reaction that generates few to no neutrons as a byproduct. &quot;The base thruster generates high-speed protons through the ionization of water vapor,&quot; noted the press release. Therefore, these protons collide with the nucleus of a boron atom, which starts the fusion reaction. The FireStar Drive begins a fusion process by adding boron into the thruster exhaust, resulting in high-energy particles that increase thrust.
 
RocketStar&#x27;s current thruster is dubbed M1.5. Plans to test the FireStar Drive are now ongoing. The in-space technological demonstration will take place aboard D-Orbit&#x27;s patented OTV ION Satellite Carrier. The SpaceX Transporter rideshare mission will likely launch the demo test in July and October 2024. Furthermore, the team plans to undertake ground tests this year, with more in-space demonstrations scheduled for February 2025. The FireStar Drive will undergo testing as a payload aboard Rogue Space System&#x27;s Barry-2 spacecraft in the same month. The thruster M1.5 is already ready for delivery to clients.

SecurityWeek reports: A team of researchers representing several universities in the United States has disclosed the details of a new side-channel attack method that can be used to extract secret encryption keys from systems powered by Apple CPUs. The attack method, dubbed GoFetch, has been described as a microarchitectural side-channel attack that allows the extraction of secret keys from constant-time cryptographic implementations. These types of attacks require local access to the targeted system. The attack targets a hardware optimization named data memory-dependent prefetcher (DMP), which attempts to prefetch ad…</span>

Employment as a nurse or midwife depends on enrollment with the NMC in the UK. According to whistleblower evidence seen by The Register, the databases on which the personal information is held lack rudimentary technical standards and practices. The NMC said its data was secure with a high level of quality, allowing it to fulfill its regulatory role, although it was on &quot;a journey of improvement.&quot; But without basic documentation, or the primary keys or foreign keys common in database management, the Microsoft SQL Server databases -- holding information…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from the New York Times: General Motors said Friday that it had stopped sharing details about how people drove its cars with two data brokers that created risk profiles for the insurance industry. The decision followed a New York Times report this month that G.M. had, for years, been sharing data about drivers&#x27; mileage, braking, acceleration and speed with the insurance industry. The drivers were enrolled -- some unknowingly, they said -- in OnStar Smart Driver, a feature in G.M.&#x27;s internet-connected cars that collected data about how the car had been driven and promised feedback and digital badges for good driving. Some drivers said their insurance rates had increased as a result of the captured data, which G.M. shared with two brokers, LexisNexis Risk Solutions and Verisk. The firms then sold the data to insurance companies. Since Wednesday, &quot;OnStar Smart Driver customer data is no longer being shared with LexisNexis or Verisk,&quot; a G.M. spokeswoman, Malorie Lucich, said in an emailed statement. &quot;Customer trust is a priority for us, and we are actively evaluating our privacy processes and policies.&quot;

                              <span>Boom Supersonic&#x27;s first aircraft, the XB-1, completed its first flight today and met &quot;all of its test objectives.&quot; From a report: This initial test only saw the aircraft 7,120 feet above sea level and fly at a top speed of 238 knots (274 mph) -- far from Mach 1, the speed of sound. The first flight of XB-1 took place at the Mojave Air &amp; Space Port in California, in the same airspace where the X-1 broke the sound barrier, the X-15 conducted test flights for altitude and speed records, and the SR-71 Blackbird was also tested. According to Boom, the XB-1 will be testing, among other things:

Mozilla only began bundling Onerep in Firefox last month, when it announced the reputation service would be offered on a subscription basis as part of Mozilla Monitor Plus.

                              <span>DOJ, in the court filing (PDF): Many prominent, well-financed companies have tried and failed to successfully enter the relevant markets because of these entry barriers. Past failures include Amazon (which released its Fire mobile phone in 2014 but could not profitably sustain its business and exited the following year); Microsoft (which discontinued its mobile business in 2017); HTC (which exited the market by selling its smartphone business to Google in September 2017); and LG (which exited the smartphone market in 2021). Today, only Samsung and Google remain as meaningful competitors in the U.S. performance smartphone market. Barriers are so high that Google is a distant third to Apple and Samsung despite the fact that Google controls development of the Android operating system.

                              <span>An Internet service provider that admitted lying to the FCC about where it offers broadband will pay a $10,000 fine and implement a compliance plan to prevent future violations. ArsTechnica: Jefferson County Cable (JCC), a small ISP in Toronto, Ohio, admitted that it falsely claimed to offer fiber service in an area that it hadn&#x27;t expanded to yet. A company executive also admitted that the firm submitted false coverage data to prevent other ISPs from obtaining government grants to serve the area. Ars helped expose the incident in a February 2023 article. 

The FCC announced the outcome of its investigation on March 15, saying that Jefferson County Cable violated the Broadband Data Collection program requirements and the Broadband DATA Act, a US law, &quot;in connection with reporting inaccurate information or data with respect to the Company&#x27;s ability to provide broadband Internet access service.&quot; The FCC said: &quot;To settle this matter, Jefferson County Cable agrees to pay a $10,000 civil penalty to the United States Treasury. Jefferson County Cable also agrees to implement enhanced compliance measures. This action will help further the Commission&#x27;s efforts to bridge the digital divide by having accurate data of locations where broadband service is available.&quot;

                              <span>The U.S. Department of Transportation has announced it will conduct a review of the data practices of the country&#x27;s ten largest airlines, amid concerns over potential misuse of customer information for upselling, overcharging, targeted advertising, and third-party data sales, as well as the security of systems handling sensitive data such as passport numbers. From a report: The probe will look at air carriers&#x27; policies and procedures to determine if they are safeguarding personal info properly, unfairly or deceptively monetizing it, or sharing it with third parties, the agency said yesterday. If they&#x27;re indeed doing anything &quot;problematic,&quot; they can look forward to scrutiny, fines, and new rules, says the DOT. &quot;Airline passengers should have confidence that their personal information is not being shared improperly with third parties or mishandled by employees,&quot; said US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. 

&quot;This review of airline practices is the beginning of a new initiative by DOT to ensure airlines are being good stewards of sensitive passenger data.&quot; The ten airlines going under the magnifying glass are Delta, United, American, Southwest, Alaska, JetBlue, Spirit, Frontier, Hawaiian and Allegiant.

                              <span>In the shadow of a massive monument glorifying nuclear power, over 30 nations from around the world pledged to use the controversial energy source to help achieve a climate-neutral globe while providing countries with an added sense of strategic security. Associated Press: The idea of a Nuclear Energy Summit would have been unthinkable a dozen years ago after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan, but the tide has turned in recent years. A warming planet has made it necessary to phase out fossil fuels, while the war in Ukraine has laid bare Europe&#x27;s dependence on Russian energy. &quot;We have to do everything possible to facilitate the contribution of nuclear energy,&quot; said Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency. &quot;It is clear: Nuclear is there. It has an important role to play,&quot; he said. 

In a solemn pledge, 34 nations, including the United States, China, France, Britain and Saudi Arabia, committed &quot;to work to fully unlock the potential of nuclear energy by taking measures such as enabling conditions to support and competitively finance the lifetime extension of existing nuclear reactors, the construction of new nuclear power plants and the early deployment of advanced reactors.&quot; The statement adds: &quot;We commit to support all countries, especially emerging nuclear ones, in their capacities and efforts to add nuclear energy to their energy mixes.&quot;

From a report: While the DMCA takedown request has not yet appeared on GitLab&#x27;s public repository of such requests, a GitLab spokesperson confirmed to The Verge that the project was taken down after the site received notice &quot;from a representative of the rightsholder.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Thanks to the vaccination program that began in 1995, chickenpox is now relatively rare. Cases of the miserable, itchy condition have fallen more than 97 percent. But, while children have largely put the oatmeal baths and oven mitts behind them, doctors have apparently let their diagnostic skills get a little crusty. According to a study published Thursday, public health researchers in Minnesota found that 55 percent of people diagnosed with chickenpox based on their symptoms were actually negative for the varicella-zoster virus, the virus that causes chickenpox. The study noted that the people were all diagnosed in person by health care providers in medical facilities. But, instead of chickenpox, lab testing showed that some of the patients were actually infected with an enterovirus, which can cause a rash, or the herpes simplex virus 1, which causes cold sores. 

The study, published in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#x27;s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, supports expanding laboratory testing for suspected chickenpox cases in the state&#x27;s program and highlights that diagnoses based on symptoms are &quot;unreliable.&quot; For one thing, doctors simply see far fewer chickenpox cases these days because of the protection from vaccines. While chickenpox cases in the US previously reached 4 million each year, with 10,500 to 13,500 hospitalizations and 100 to 150 deaths, there are now fewer than 150,000 cases,1,400 hospitalizations, and 30 deaths each year, the CDC reports. Vaccination is more than 90 percent effective at preventing the disease. In the rare cases where a vaccinated person contracts chickenpox, the muted rashes are challenging to identify by eye. But even in unvaccinated children, chickenpox can be tricky to pick out; it can easily be confused with measles, insect bites, enterovirus, skin infections such as scabies and impetigo, herpes viruses, and hand, foot, and mouth disease.

                              <span>The guardians of the world&#x27;s official geological timescale have firmly rejected a proposal to declare an Anthropocene epoch, after an epic academic row. From a report: The proposal would have designated the period from 1952 as the Anthropocene to reflect the planet-changing impact of humanity. It would have ended the Holocene epoch, the 11,700 years of stable climate since the last ice age and during which human civilisation arose. The International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) has announced, however, that geologists have rejected the idea in a series of votes. Those objecting noted a much longer history of human impacts on Earth, including the dawn of agriculture and the industrial revolution, and unease about including a new unit in the geological timescale with a span of less than less than a single human lifetime, it said. Most units span thousands or millions of years. 

It also acknowledged: &quot;The Anthropocene as a concept will continue to be widely used not only by Earth and environmental scientists, but also by social scientists, politicians and economists, as well as by the public at large. As such, it will remain an invaluable descriptor in human-environment interactions.&quot; The Anthropocene working group (AWG), which was formed by the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS), in turn part of the IUGS, took 15 years to develop the proposal. It concluded that the radioactive isotopes spread worldwide by hydrogen bomb tests were the best marker of humanity&#x27;s transformation of the planet. Geological time units also need a specific location to typify the unit and the Crawford sinkhole lake in Canada was chosen.

                              <span>Food prices and overall inflation will rise as temperatures climb with climate change, a new study by an environmental scientist and the European Central Bank found. From a report: Looking at monthly price tags of food and other goods, temperatures and other climate factors in 121 nations since 1996, researchers calculate that &quot;weather and climate shocks&quot; will cause the cost of food to rise 1.5 to 1.8 percentage points annually within a decade or so, even higher in already hot places like the Middle East, according to a study in Thursday&#x27;s journal Communications, Earth and the Environment. 

And that translates to an increase in overall inflation of 0.8 to 0.9 percentage points by 2035, just caused by climate change extreme weather, the study said. Those numbers may look small, but to banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve that fight inflation, they are significant, said study lead author Max Kotz, a climate scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. &quot;The physical impacts of climate change are going to have a persistent effect on inflation,&quot; Kotz said. &quot;This is really from my perspective another example of one of the ways in which climate change can undermine human welfare, economic welfare.&quot;

stewardship of the project to Redis Labs.
changed the license to be proprietary,
a widely unpopular action. You know someone is up to no good when they write
&quot;Live long and prosper 🖖&quot; directly above a meme of Darth Vader.




What are the actual problems with these licenses?
In short summary, the licenses limit the freedoms of what one can do with
the software in order for Redis Labs to be solely enriched, while asking for
volunteer labor, and having already
benefitted from volunteer labor, that is and was generally offered only
because it enriches everybody.

But at one private event in 2022, a select group of researchers were actually invited to hack a Vegas hotel room, competing in a suite crowded with their laptops and cans of Red Bull to find digital vulnerabilities in every one of the room&#x27;s gadgets, from its TV to its bedside VoIP phone. One team of hackers spent those days focused on the lock on the room&#x27;s door, perhaps its most sensitive piece of tech…</span>

                              <span>In a Threads post today, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the Twitter rival is rolling out a beta of its fediverse integration in the U.S., Canada, and Japan. With the feature enabled, Threads users will be able to cross-post and view likes from other federated platforms, like Mastodon. The Verge reports: Threads previewed its fediverse integration earlier this week during the FediForum. As outlined on its support page, Meta says that you must have a public account to turn on fediverse sharing, which will allow users on other servers to &quot;search for and follow your profile, view your posts, interact with your content, and share your content to anyone on or off their server.&quot;
 
There are still a few limitations, though. The beta currently doesn&#x27;t let users view replies and follows from the fediverse, for example. Meta also can&#x27;t promise that when you delete a federated post on Threads, it will also get deleted on the other platforms it was shared on.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Reuters: The United Nations General Assembly on Thursday unanimously adopted the first global resolution on artificial intelligence to encourage protecting personal data, monitoring AI for risks, and safeguarding human rights, U.S. officials said. The nonbinding resolution, proposed by the United States and co-sponsored by China and 121 other nations, took three months to negotiate and also advocates strengthening privacy policies, the officials said, briefing reporters before the resolution&#x27;s passage. &quot;We&#x27;re sailing in choppy waters with the fast-changing technology, which means that its more important than ever to steer by the light of our values,&quot; said one of the senior administration officials, describing the resolution as the &quot;first-ever truly global consensus document on AI.&quot;
 
&quot;The improper or malicious design, development, deployment and use of artificial intelligence systems ... pose risks that could ... undercut the protection, promotion and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms,&quot; the measure says. Asked whether negotiators faced resistance from Russia or China -- U.N. member states that also voted in favor of the document -- the officials conceded there were &quot;lots of heated conversations. ... But we actively engaged with China, Russia, Cuba, other countries that often don&#x27;t see eye to eye with us on issues.&quot; &quot;We believe the resolution strikes the appropriate balance between furthering development, while continuing to protect human rights,&quot; said one of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

                              <span>India reversed a laptop licensing policy after behind-the-scenes lobbying by U.S. officials, who however remain concerned about New Delhi&#x27;s compliance with WTO obligations and new rules it may issue, according to U.S. trade officials and government emails seen by Reuters. From the report: In August, India imposed rules requiring firms like Apple, Dell and HP to obtain licences for all shipments of imported laptops, tablets, personal computers and servers, raising fears that the process could slow down sales. But New Delhi rolled back the policy within weeks, saying it will only monitor the imports and decide on next steps a year later. 

The U.S. government emails -- obtained under a U.S. open records request -- underline the level of alarm the Indian curbs caused in Washington, and how th…</span>

                              <span>Google&#x27;s second developer preview for Android 15 has arrived, bringing long-awaited support for satellite connectivity alongside several improvements to contactless payments, multi-language recognition, volume consistency, and interaction with PDFs via apps. From a report: These developer-focused betas are a proving ground for features that will likely make it into the final public release scheduled for later this year. According to Google, public beta releases should be available to test between April and July. The latest developer preview addresses some nuisances and security concerns experienced by Android users, such as making apps more aware of why some services might be unavailable when devices are using a satellite connection. This is also the first official confirmation that Android 15 will come with satellite messaging, with Google&#x27;s press release saying that the new preview includes support for &quot;preloaded RCS applications to use satellite connectivity for sending and receiving messages.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Even if you decide to stop offering free editions, you don&#x27;t get to stop providing the source code to FOSS, users of JasperReports Server are complaining. Cloud Software Group -- the post-merger offspring of Citrix and Tibco -- has decided to withdraw the community edition of its JasperReports Server. Now all you can get is the commercial edition, with a 30-day free trial. Effectively, this seems like a similar tactic to Red Hat&#x27;s unpopular changes to the way that the RHEL source code is distributed. Some of the JasperReports source code is still on Github, but not everything. The JasperSoft community website has the grumbling of unhappy users -- as does Reddit. 

One user on the community website commented: &quot;Are you aware Jasper Server CE was under the Affero GPL, and you can&#x27;t delete everything? &quot;You cannot just change the license of the previous versions and call it a day. I mean, we the users, have the right to fork it using the same license or a compatible one,&quot; the user protested. JasperSoft has been developing its reporting tools in the open for well over a decade -- the Reg was reporting on it nearly twenty years ago. Tibco acquired the company for some $185 million in 2014. We&#x27;re not certain that things are going very well for the new outfit. Early last year, the merger was followed by a round of job losses, and the company has also more recently doubled its prices on some offerings.

                              <span>Motorola&#x27;s 2024 Moto G Power impresses with its soft-touch back and contoured edges at a $300 price point, despite an underwhelming camera and LCD panel. Except one thing: the bloatware. The Verge: Scroll through the app drawer and you&#x27;ll see a handful of automatically downloaded &quot;folders.&quot; They are not folders; they are apps. I first encountered them on last year&#x27;s Moto G Stylus 5G, and I hate them very much. There are three main offenders -- Shopping, Entertainment, and GamesHub -- and each of these apps acts as a little hub. Icons for apps that you have legitimately downloaded will appear in the corresponding &quot;folder.&quot; You&#x27;ll also find tons of other suggested apps to download -- pages and pages of them! Apps as far as the eye can see! 

Dismissing the suggested apps section replaces it with a &quot;Discover&quot; section. In the shopping app, it invites you to &quot;Unlock the power of shopping&quot; with links to buy stuff like kitschy Easter decor from TJ Maxx. Mercifully, there&#x27;s a toggle to hide this section. These apps are all made by a company called Swish, and you can&#x27;t opt out of downloading any of them during the setup process. You can (and should!) opt out of downloading a third-party lock screen from a different service called Glance. The more I dig into the software on this phone, the more I hate it. The preinstalled weather app is festooned with ads and even more suggested apps, plus pithy insights like &quot;Gotta love air conditioning at these high levels of humidity.&quot; If you tap the option to remove ads, a pop-up asks you to pay $4 for 1Weather Pro.

                              <span>The Coalition for App Fairness, an industry body that represents Epic, Spotify, Match Group and Proton among others, issued the following statement following the U.S. announcing it had sued Apple: &quot;With today&#x27;s announcement, the Department of Justice is taking a strong stand against Apple&#x27;s stranglehold over the mobile app ecosystem, which stifles competition and hurts American consumers and developers alike. The DOJ complaint details Apple&#x27;s long history of illegal conduct -- abusing their App Store guidelines and developer agreements to increase prices, extract exorbitant fees, degrade user experiences, and choke off competition. The DOJ joins regulators around the world, who have recognized the many harms of Apple&#x27;s abusive behavior and are working to address it. As this case unfolds in the coming years more must be done now to end the anticompetitive practices of all mobile app gatekeepers. It remains imperative that Congress pass bipartisan legislation, like the Open App Markets Act, to create a free and open mobile app marketplace.&quot; Further reading: Apple Loses $115 Billion in Market Value as Regulators Close In.

From a report: The flaw -- a side channel allowing end-to-end key extractions when Apple chips run implementations of widely used cryptographic protocols -- can&#x27;t be patched directly because it stems from the microarchitectural design of the silicon itself. Instead, it can only be mitigated by building defenses into third-party cryptographic software that could drastically degrade M-series performance when executing cryptographic operations, particularly on the earlier M1 and M2 generations.

                              <span>Microsoft has announced two new Surface devices, the Surface Pro 10 for Business and Surface Laptop 6 for Business, both featuring Intel&#x27;s latest Core Ultra processors, a dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU), and a new Copilot key for AI-powered features in Windows 11. 

The devices, which will start shipping to commercial customers on April 9th, have been designed exclusively for businesses and will not be sold directly to consumers. The Surface Pro 10 for Business, starting at $1,199, offers a choice between Core Ultra 5 135U and Core Ultra 7 165U options, with up to 64GB of RAM and a 256GB Gen4 SSD. It also features an improved 13-inch display with an antireflective coating and a 1440p front-facing camera with a 114-degree field of view. 

The Surface Laptop 6 for Business, also starting at $1,199, is powered by Intel&#x27;s Core Ultra H-series chips and is available with up to 64GB of RAM and a 1TB Gen4 SSD. The 15-inch model includes two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports, while the 13.5-inch model features a single USB-C Thunderbolt 4 port. Both devices have an optional smart card reader and are Microsoft&#x27;s most easily serviceable Surface devices to date.

                              <span>theodp writes: &quot;Last year,&quot; Ian Bogost writes in Universities Have a Computer-Science Problem, &quot;18 percent of Stanford University seniors graduated with a degree in computer science, more than double the proportion of just a decade earlier. Over the same period at MIT, that rate went up from 23 percent to 42 percent. These increases are common everywhere: The average number of undergraduate CS majors at universities in the U.S. and Canada tripled in the decade after 2005, and it keeps growing. Students&#x27; interest in CS is intellectual -- culture moves through computation these days -- but it is also professional. Young people hope to access the wealth, power, and influence of the technology sector. That ambition has created both enormous administrative strain and a competition for prestige.&quot; 

&quot;Another approach has gained in popularity,&quot; Bogost notes. &quot;Universities are consolidating the formal study of CS into a new administrative structure: the college of computing. [...] When they elevate computing to the status of a college, with departments and a budget, they are declaring it a higher-order domain of knowledge and practice, akin to law or engineering. That decision will inform a fundamental question: whether computing ought to be seen as a superfield that lords over all others, or just a servant of other domains, subordinated to their interests and control. This is, by no happenstance, also the basic question about computing in our society writ large.&quot; 

Bogost concludes: &quot;I used to think computing education might be stuck in a nesting-doll version of the engineer&#x27;s fallacy, in which CS departments have been asked to train more software engineers without considering whether more software engineers are really what the world needs. Now I worry that they have a bigger problem to address: how to make computer people care about everything else as much as they care about computers.

                              <span>For the first time, surgeons have transplanted a kidney from a genetically modified pig into a living person, doctors in Boston said Thursday. From a report: Richard Slayman, 62, of Weymouth, Mass., who is suffering from end-stage kidney disease, received the organ Saturday in a four-hour procedure, Massachusetts General Hospital announced. He is recovering well and is expected to be discharged soon, the hospital said. &quot;I saw it not only as a way to help me, but a way to provide hope for the thousands of people who need a transplant to survive,&quot; Slayman said in a statement released by the hospital. 

The procedure is the latest development in a fast-moving race to create genetically modified pigs to provide kidneys, livers, hearts and other organs to help alleviate the shortage of organs for people who need transplants. &quot;Our hope is that this transplant approach will offer a lifeline to millions of patients worldwide who are suffering from kidney failure,&quot; said Dr. Tatsuo Kawai, the hospital&#x27;s director for clinical transplant tolerance, in the hospital statement. 

Several biotech companies are racing to develop a supply of cloned pigs whose DNA has been genetically modified so they won&#x27;t be rejected by the human body, spread pig viruses to people or cause other complications. NPR recently got exclusive access to a research farm breeding these animals for a company in this competition, Revivicor Inc. of Blacksburg, Va. The kidney transplanted in Boston came from a pig created by eGenesis of Cambridge, Mass. The eGenesis pigs are bred with 69 genetic modifications to prepare organs for human transplantation. The changes protect against a virus known to infect pigs as well as delete pig genes and add human genes to make the organs compatible with people.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: In India, a government-run agency will now monitor and undertake fact-checking for government related matters on social media even as tech giants expressed grave concerns about it last year. The Ministry of Electronics and IT on Wednesday wrote in a gazette notification that it is amending the IT Rules 2021 to cement into law the proposal to make the fact checking unit of Press Information Bureau the dedicated arbiter of truth for New Delhi matters. Tech companies as well as other firms that serve more than 5 million users in India will be required to &quot;make reasonable efforts&quot; to not display, store, transmit or otherwise share information that deceives or misleads users about matters pertaining to the government, the IT ministry said. India&#x27;s move comes just weeks ahead of the general elections in the country. Relying on a government agency such as the Press Information Bureau as the sole source to fact-check government business without giving it a clear definition or providing clear checks and balances &quot;may lead to misuse during implementation of the law, which will profoundly infringe on press freedom,&quot; Asia Internet Coalition, an industry group that represents Meta, Amazon, Google and Apple, cautioned last year.
 
Meanwhile, comedian Kunal Kamra, with support from the Editors Guild of India, cautioned that the move could create an environment that forces social media firms to welcome &quot;a regime of self-interested censorship.&quot;

                              <span>The macOS Sonoma 14.4 update introduces a bug affecting iCloud Drive&#x27;s versioning system, where users with &quot;Optimize Mac Storage&quot; enabled can lose all previous versions of a file removed from local storage. MacRumors reports: Versions are normally created automatically when users save files using apps that work with the version system in macOS. According to The Eclectic Light Company&#x27;s Howard Oakley, users running macOS 14.4 that have &quot;Optimize Mac Storage&quot; enabled should be aware that they are at risk of losing all previously saved versions of a file if they opt to remove it from iCloud Drive local storage: &quot;In previous versions of macOS, when a file is evicted from local storage in iCloud Drive [using the Remove Download option in the right-click contextual menu], all its saved versions have been preserved. Download that file again from iCloud Drive, and versions saved on that Mac (but not other Macs or devices) have remained fully accessible. Do that in 14.4, and all previous versions are now removed, and lost forever.&quot;
 
Oakley said his own tests confirmed that this behavior does not happen in macOS Sonoma 14.3 or macOS Ventura, so it is exclusive to macOS 14.4. For users who have already updated, he suggests either not saving files to iCloud Drive at all, or turning off Optimize Mac Storage. To perform the latter in System Settings, click your Apple ID, select iCloud, and then toggle off the switch next to &quot;Optimize Mac Storage.&quot; You may need to perform this action twice -- reports suggest it can turn back on by itself. For a more exhaustive account of the problem, see Oakley&#x27;s subsequent post.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Google closed its Fitbit acquisition in 2021. Since then, the tech behemoth has pushed numerous changes to the wearable brand, including upcoming updates announced this week. While Google reshapes its fitness tracker business, though, some long-time users are regretting their Fitbit purchases and questioning if Google&#x27;s practices will force them to purchase their next fitness tracker elsewhere.
 
As is becoming common practice with consumer tech announcements of late, Google&#x27;s latest announcements about Fitbit seemed to be trying to convince users of the wonders of generative AI and how that will change their gadgets for the better. In a blog post yesterday, Dr. Karen DeSalvo, Google&#x27;s chief health officer, announced that Fitbit Premiu…</span>

                              <span>samleecole writes: Last month, the surveillance company Flock Safety published a study and press release claiming that its automated license plate readers (ALPR) are &quot;instrumental in solving 10 percent of reported crime in the U.S.&quot; The study was done by Flock employees, and given legitimacy with the &quot;oversight&quot; of two academic researchers whose names are also on the paper. Now, one of those researchers has told 404 Media that &quot;I personally would have done things much differently&quot; than the Flock researchers did. 

The researcher, Johnny Nhan of Texas Christian University, said that he has pivoted future research on Flock because he found &quot;the information that is collected by the police departments are too varied and incomplete for us to do any type of meaningful statistical analysis on them.&quot; Flock is one of the largest vendors of ALPR cameras and other surveillance technologies, and is partially responsible for the widespread proliferation of this technology. It markets its cameras to law enforcement, homeowners associations, property managers, schools, and businesses. It regularly publishes in-house case studies and white papers that it says shows Flock is instrumental in solving and reducing crime, then uses those studies to market its products.

                              <span>EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager on Tuesday warned Apple and Meta on their new fees for their services, saying that this may hinder users from enjoying the benefits of the Digital Markets Act which aims to give them more choices. From a report: Apple announced a slew of changes in January in a bid to comply with the landmark EU tech legislation which requires it to open up its closed eco-system to rivals. 

A new fee structure includes a core technology fee of 50 euro cents per user account per year that major app developers will have to pay even if they do not use any of Apple&#x27;s payment services, which has triggered criticism from rivals such as Fortnite creator Epic Games. Vestager said the new fees have attracted her attention. &quot;There are things that we take a keen interest in, for instance, if the new Apple fee structure will de facto not make it in any way attractive to use the benefits of the DMA. That kind of thing is what we will be investigating,&quot; she told Reuters in an interview. Further reading: Apple Working on Solution for App Store Fee That Could Bankrupt Viral Apps.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Since the start of the year, more than 50,000 workers have been laid off from over 200 tech companies, according to tracking website Layoffs.fyi. It&#x27;s a continuation of the predominant theme of 2023, when more than 260,000 workers across nearly 1,200 tech companies lost their jobs. Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft have all taken part in the downsizing this year, along with eBay, Unity Software, SAP and Cisco. Wall Street has largely cheered on the cost-cutting, sending many tech stocks to record highs on optimism that spending discipline coupled with efficiency gains from artificial intelligence will lead to rising profits. PayPal announced in January that it was eliminating 9% of its workforce, or about 2,500 jobs. 

For the tens of thousands of people in Croisant&#x27;s [anecdote in the linked story] position, the path toward reemployment is daunting. All told, 2023 was the second-biggest year of cuts on record in the technology sector, behind only the dot-com crash in 2001, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas. Not since the spectacular flameouts of Pets.com, eToys and Webvan have so many tech workers lost their jobs in such a short period of time. Last month&#x27;s job cut count was the highest of any February since 2009, when the financial crisis forced companies into cash preservation mode.

                              <span>NVIDIA has been working on adding generative AI to non-playable characters (NPCs) for a while now. The company is hoping a newly-announced partnership with Ubisoft will accelerate development of this technology and, ultimately, bring these AI-driven NPCs to modern games. From a report: Ubisoft helped build new &quot;NEO NPCs&quot; by using NVIDIA&#x27;s Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) technology, with an assist from dynamic NPC experts Inworld AI. The end result? Characters that don&#x27;t repeat the same phrase over and over, while ignoring the surrounding violent mayhem. These NEO NPCs are said to interact in real time with players, the environment and other in-game characters. NVIDIA says this opens up &quot;new possibilities for emergent storytelling.&quot; To that end, Ubisoft&#x27;s narrative team built complete backgrounds, knowledge bases and conversational styles for two NPCs as a proof of concept.

                              <span>Major U.S. broadband internet providers must start displaying information similar to nutrition labels on food products to help consumers shop for services starting on April 10, under new rules from the Federal Communications Commission. From a report: Verizon Communications said it will begin providing the labels on Wednesday. The FCC first moved to mandate the labels in 2022. Smaller providers will be required to provide labels starting in October. The rules require broadband providers to display, at the point of sale, labels that show prices, speeds, fees and data allowances for both wireless and wired products.
Verizon Chief Customer Experience Officer Brian Higgins said in an interview the labels will help consumers make &quot;an equal comparison&quot; between product offerings, speeds and fees. 

Higgins said standardized labels across the industry &quot;make it easier for customers to do a comparison of which provider is going to be the best fit for their needs.&quot; He said customers will still need to research various bundling offers across carriers. The labels were first unveiled as a voluntary program in 2016. Congress ordered the FCC to mandate them under the 2021 infrastructure law. &quot;Consumers will finally get information they can use to comparison shop, avoid junk fees, and make informed choices about which high-speed internet service is the best fit for their needs and budget,&quot; FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: On Sunday, the world of video games was shaken by a hacking and cheating scandal. During a competitive esports tournament of Apex Legends, a free-to-play shooter video game played by hundreds of thousands of players daily, hackers appeared to insert cheats into the games of two well-known streamers -- effectively hacking the players midgame. &quot;Wait, what the fuck? I&#x27;m getting hacked, I&#x27;m getting hacked bro, I&#x27;m getting hacked,&quot; said one of the players allegedly compromised during a livestream of the gameplay. The incidents forced the organizers of the Apex Legends Global Series tournament, which has a $5 million total prize pool, to postpone the event indefinitely &quot;due to the competitive integrity of this series being compromised.&quot;

                              <span>The abstract of a new paper published on Journal of Financial Economics: We study aggregate lapsation risk in the life insurance sector. We construct two lapsation risk factors that explain a large fraction of the common variation in lapse rates of the 30 largest life insurance companies. The first is a cyclical factor that is positively correlated with credit spreads and unemployment, while the second factor is a trend factor that correlates with the level of interest rates. Using a novel policy-level database from a large life insurer, we examine the heterogeneity in risk factor exposures based on policy and policyholder characteristics. 

Young policyholders with higher health risk in low-income areas are more likely to lapse their policies during economic downturns. We explore the implications for hedging and valuation of life insurance contracts. Ignoring aggregate lapsation risk results in mispricing of life insurance policies. The calibrated model points to overpricing on average. In the cross-section, young, low-income, and high-health risk households face higher effective mark-ups than the old, high-income, and healthy.

                              <span>The White House said Wednesday Intel has been awarded up to $8.5 billion in CHIPS Act funding, as the Biden administration ramps up its effort to bring semiconductor manufacturing to U.S. soil. From a report: Intel could receive an additional $11 billion in loans from the CHIPS and Science Act, which was passed in 2022. The awards will be announced by President Joe Biden in Arizona on Wednesday. The money will help &quot;leading-edge semiconductors made in the United States&quot; keep &quot;America in the driver&#x27;s seat of innovation,&quot; U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said on a call with reporters. Intel and the White House said their agreement is nonbinding and preliminary and could change. 

Intel has long been a stalwart of the U.S. semiconductor industry, developing chips that power many of the world&#x27;s PCs and data center servers. However, the company has been eclipsed in revenue by Nvidia, which leads in artificial intelligence chips, and has been surpassed in market cap by rival AMD and mobile phone chipmaker Qualcomm.

                              <span>CoinDesk: The Ethereum Foundation -- the Swiss non-profit organization at the heart of the Ethereum ecosystem -- is under investigation by an unnamed &quot;state authority,&quot; according to the group&#x27;s website&#x27;s GitHub repository. The scope of the investigation and its focus was unknown at press time. According to the GitHub commit dated Feb. 26, 2024, &quot;we have received a voluntary enquiry from a state authority that included a requirement for confidentiality.&quot; 

The investigation comes during a time of change for Ethereum&#x27;s technology. Ethereum is the second-largest blockchain by market cap after Bitcoin, launching in 2015 following an initial coin offering for the chain&#x27;s native ETH token. Earlier this month, the chain underwent a major technical upgrade, dubbed Dencun, designed to bring down transaction costs for users of Ethereum-based layer-2 platforms.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: When OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced GPTs, custom chatbots powered by OpenAI&#x27;s generative AI models, onstage at the company&#x27;s first-ever developer conference in November, he described them as a way to &quot;accomplish all sorts of tasks&quot; -- from programming to learning about esoteric scientific subjects to getting workout pointers. &quot;Because [GPTs] combine instructions, expanded knowledge and actions, they can be more helpful to you,&quot; Altman said. &quot;You can build a GPT ... for almost anything.&quot; He wasn&#x27;t kidding about the anything part. 

TechCrunch found that the GPT Store, OpenAI&#x27;s official marketplace for GPTs, is flooded with bizarre, potentially copyright-infringing GPTs that imply a light touch where it concerns OpenAI&#x27;s moderation efforts. A cursory search pulls up GPTs that purport to generate art in the style of Disney and Marvel properties, serve as little more than funnels to third-party paid services, advertise themselves as being able to bypass AI content detection tools such as Turnitin and Copyleaks.

                              <span>Haje Jan Kamps writes via TechCrunch: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) -- often referred to as &quot;strong AI,&quot; &quot;full AI,&quot; &quot;human-level AI&quot; or &quot;general intelligent action&quot; -- represents a significant future leap in the field of artificial intelligence. Unlike narrow AI, which is tailored for specific tasks (such as detecting product flaws, summarize the news, or build you a website), AGI will be able to perform a broad spectrum of cognitive tasks at or above human levels. Addressing the press this week at Nvidia&#x27;s annual GTC developer conference, CEO Jensen Huang appeared to be getting really bored of discussing the subject -- not least because he finds himself misquoted a lot, he says.

                              <span>Christopher Harper reports via Tom&#x27;s Hardware: Earlier this month, Danluu.com released an exhaustive 23-page analysis/op-ed/manifesto on the current status of unoptimized web pages and web app performance, finding that just loading a web page can even bog down an entry-level device that can run the popular game PUBG at 40 fps. In fact, the Wix webpage requires loading 21MB of data for one page, while the more famous websites Patreon and Threads load 13MB of data for one page. This can result in slow load times that reach up to 33 seconds or, in some cases, result in the page failing to load at all.
 
As the testing above shows, some of the most brutally intensive websites include the likes of... Quora, and basically every major social media platform. Newer content production platforms like Squarespace and newer Forum platforms like Discourse also have significantly worse performance than their older counterparts, often to the point of unusability on some devices. The Tecno S8C, one of the prominent entry-level phones common in emerging markets, is one particularly compelling test device that stuck. The device is actually quite impressive in some ways, including its ability to run PlayerUnknown&#x27;s Battlegrounds Mobile at 40 FPS -- but the same device can&#x27;t even run Quora and experiences nigh-unusable lag when scrolling on social media sites.
 
That example is most likely the best summation of the overall point, which is that modern web and app design is increasingly trending toward an unrealistic assumption of ever-increasing bandwidth and processing. Quora is a website where people answer questions -- there is absolutely no reason any of these websites should be harder to run than a Battle Royale game.

                              <span>&quot;Job openings across the country are seemingly endless,&quot; writes longtime Slashdot reader smooth wombat. &quot;Millions of jobs are listed, but are they real? Companies may post job openings with no intent to ever fill it. These are known as ghost jobs and there are more than most people realize. The BBC reports: Clarify Capital, a New York-based business loan provider, surveyed 1,000 hiring managers, and found nearly seven in 10 jobs stay open for more than 30 days, with 10% unfilled for more than half a year. Half the respondents reported they keep job listings open indefinitely because they &quot;always open to new people.&quot; More than one in three respondents said they kept the listings active to build a pool of applicants in case of turnover -- not because a role needs to be filled in a timely manner.
 
The posted roles are more than just a talent vacuum sucking up resumes from applicants. They are also a tool for shaping perception inside and outside of the company. More than 40% of hiring managers said they list jobs they aren&#x27;t actively trying to fill to give the impression that the company is growing. A similar share said the job listings are made to motivate employees, while 34% said the jobs are posted to placate overworked staff who may be hoping for additional help to be brought on.
 
&quot;Ghost jobs are everywhere,&quot; says Geoffrey Scott, senior content manager and hiring manager at Resume Genius, a US company that helps workers design their resumes. &quot;We discovered a massive 1.7 million potential ghost job openings on LinkedIn just in the US,&quot; says Scott. In the UK, StandOut CV, a London-based career resources company, found more than a third of job listings in 2023 were ghost jobs, defined as listings posted for more than 30 days. &quot;Experts caution not every posting that seems like a ghost job is one,&quot; notes the report. &quot;Still, whether these postings are ghost jobs -- or simply look and feel like them -- the result is similar. Jobseekers end up discouraged and burnt out.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Wired: YouTube has updated its rulebook for the era of deepfakes. Starting today, anyone uploading video to the platform must disclose certain uses of synthetic media, including generative AI, so viewers know what they&#x27;re seeing isn&#x27;t real. YouTube says it applies to &quot;realistic&quot; altered media such as &quot;making it appear as if a real building caught fire&quot; or swapping&quot;the face of one individual with another&#x27;s.&quot; The new policy shows YouTube taking steps that could help curb the spread of AI-generated misinformation as the US presidential election approaches. It is also striking for what it permits: AI-generated animations aimed at kids are not subject to the new synthetic content disclosure rules.

                              <span>According to the New York Times, Saudi Arabia&#x27;s government plans to create a fund of about $40 billion to invest in artificial intelligence. Reuters reports: Representatives of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Public Investment Fund (PIF) have discussed a potential partnership with U.S. venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and other financiers in recent weeks, the newspaper reported. Andreessen Horowitz and PIF governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan have discussed the possibility of the U.S. firm setting up an office in Riyadh, according to the report. PIF officials also discussed what role Andreessen Horowitz could play and how such a fund would work, the newspaper said, adding the plans could still change. Other venture capitalists may participate in kingdom&#x27;s artificial intelligence fund, which is expected to commence in the second half of 2024, the newspaper said.
 
Saudi representatives have indicated to potential partners that the country is interested in supporting a variety of tech start-ups associated with artificial intelligence, including chip makers and large-scale data centers, the report added. Last month, PIF&#x27;s Al-Rumayyan pitched the kingdom as a prospective hub for artificial intelligence activity outside U.S., citing its energy resources and funding capacity. Al-Rumayyan had said the kingdom had the &quot;political will&quot; to make artificial intelligence projects happen and ample funds it could deploy to nurture the technology&#x27;s development.

In a new paper on arXiv, researchers analyzed the peer reviews of papers submitted to leading AI conferences, including ICLR 2024, NeurIPS 2023, CoRL 2023 and EMNLP 2023. The Register reports on the findings: The authors took two sets of data, or corpora -- one written by humans and the other one written by machines. And they used these two bodies of text to evaluate the evaluations -- the peer reviews of conference AI papers -- for the frequency of specific adjectives. &quot;[A]ll of our calculations depend only on the adjectives contained in each document,&quot; they explained. &quot;We found this vocabulary choice to exhibit greater stability than using…</span>

                              <span>A man has been sentenced for cyber flashing in England for the first time. From a report: Nicholas Hawkes, 39, from Basildon in Essex, was jailed for 66 weeks at Southend Crown Court today after he sent unsolicited photos of his erect penis to a 15-year-old girl and a woman on 9 February. The older victim took screenshots of the offending image on WhatsApp and reported Hawkes to the police the same day. 

Cyber flashing became a criminal offence in England with the passage of the Online Safety Act on 31 January. It has been a crime in Scotland since 2010. The offence covers the sending of an unsolicited sexual image to people via social media, dating apps, text message or data-sharing services such as Bluetooth and AirDrop. Victims of cyber flashing get lifelong anonymity from the time they report the offence, as it also falls under the Sexual Offences Act.

                              <span>Soccer teams are always looking to get an edge over their rivals. Whether it&#x27;s studying players&#x27; susceptibility to injury, or opponents&#x27; tactics -- top clubs look at reams of data to give them the best shot of winning. They might want to add a new AI assistant developed by Google DeepMind to their arsenal. From a report: It can suggest tactics for soccer set-pieces that are even better than those created by professional club coaches. The system, called TacticAI, works by analyzing a dataset of 7,176 corner kicks taken by players for Liverpool FC, one of the biggest soccer clubs in the world. Corner kicks are awarded to an attacking team when the ball passes over the goal line after touching a player on the defending team. In a sport as free-flowing and unpredictable as soccer, corners -- like free kicks and penalties -- are rare instances in the game when teams can try out pre-planned plays. 

TacticAI uses predictive and generative AI models to convert each corner kick scenario -- such as a receiver successfully scoring a goal, or a rival defender intercepting the ball and returning it to their team -- into a graph, and the data from each player into a node on the graph, before modeling the interactions between each node. The work was published in Nature Communications today. Using this data, the model provides recommendations about where to position players during a corner to give them, for example, the best shot at scoring a goal, or the best combination of players to get up front. It can also try to predict the outcomes of a corner, including whether a shot will take place, or which player is most likely to touch the ball first.

                              <span>An anonymous reader writes: Mozilla Firefox 124 looks like a small update that only updates the Caret Browsing mode to also work in the PDF viewer and adds support for the Screen Wake Lock API to prevent devices from dimming or locking the screen when an application needs to keep running. The Firefox View feature has been updated as well in this release to allow users to sort open tabs by either recent activity (default setting) or tab order. Also, Firefox 124 expands Qwant&#x27;s availability to all languages in the France region along with Belgium, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland. 

This release also adds support for using HTTP(S) and relative URLs when creating WebSockets, as well as support for the AbortSignal: any() static method, which takes an iterable of abort signals and returns an AbortSignal (more details are available here). For Android users, Firefox 124 enables the Pull to Refresh feature, which is now more robust than ever, by default and adds support for the HTML drag and drop API when using a mouse, which accepts plain text or HTML text by the drop operation from external apps. 

For macOS users, this release uses the fullscreen API for all types of full-screen windows, promising a better match to the expected macOS user experience for full-screen spaces, the Menubar, and the Dock. If you want to disable this feature, you&#x27;ll need to set the full-screen-api.macos-native-full-screen preference to false in about:config. For Windows users, this release adds the ability to populate the Windows taskbar jump list more efficiently. According to Mozilla, this change should allow for a &quot;smoother overall browsing experience.&quot;

                              <span>Microsoft has named Mustafa Suleyman head of its consumer artificial intelligence business, hiring most of the staff from his Inflection AI startup as the software giant seeks to fend off Alphabet&#x27;s Google in the fiercely contested market for AI products. From a report: Suleyman, who co-founded Google&#x27;s DeepMind, will report to Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella and oversee a range of projects, such as integrating an AI Copilot into Windows and adding conversational elements to the Bing search engine. His hiring will put Microsoft&#x27;s consumer AI work under one leader for the first time. 

Inflection, a rival of Microsoft&#x27;s key AI partner OpenAI, is exiting its Pi consumer chatbot effort and shifting to selling AI software to businesses. Karen Simonyan, Inflection&#x27;s co-founder, will join Microsoft as chief scientist for the new consumer AI group. In the past year, Nadella has been revamping his company&#x27;s major products around artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI. Under the Copilot brand, Microsoft has blended an AI assistant into products including Windows, consumer and enterprise Office software, Bing and security tools. With Google and others trying to catch up, Nadella&#x27;s multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI has given Microsoft a first-mover advantage. And yet, 13 months after unveiling an AI-enhanced Bing search, the company has made few gains in that market, which remains dominated by Google.

                              <span>Joe_Dragon shares a report: Since Apple announced plans for the 0.50 euro Core Technology Fee that apps distributed using the new EU App Store business terms must pay, there have been ongoing concerns about what that fee might mean for a developer that suddenly has a free app go viral. Apple&#x27;s VP of regulatory law Kyle Andeers today met with developers during a workshop on Apple&#x27;s Digital Markets Act compliance. iOS developer Riley Testut, best known for Game Boy Advance emulator GBA4iOS, asked what Apple would do if a young developer unwittingly racked up millions in fees. 

Testut explained that when he was younger, that exact situation happened to him. Back in 2014 as an 18-year-old high school student, he released GBA4iOS outside of the App Store using an enterprise certificate. The app was unexpectedly downloaded more than 10 million times, and under Apple&#x27;s new rules with Core Technology Fee, Testut said that would have cost $5 million euros, bankrupting his family. He asked whether Apple would actually collect that fee in a similar situation, charging the high price even though it could financially ruin a family. In response, Andeers said that Apple is working on figuring out a solution, but has not done so yet. He said Apple does not want to stifle innovation and wants to figure out how to keep young app makers and their parents from feeling scared to release an app.

                              <span>Several readers shared the following report: Intermittent fasting, a diet pattern that involves alternating between periods of fasting and eating, can lower blood pressure and help some people lose weight, past research has indicated. But an analysis presented Monday at the American Heart Association&#x27;s scientific sessions in Chicago challenges the notion that intermittent fasting is good for heart health. Instead, researchers from Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine in China found that people who restricted food consumption to less than eight hours per day had a 91% higher risk of dying from cardiovascular disease over a median period of eight years, relative to people who ate across 12 to 16 hours. 

It&#x27;s some of the first research investigating the association between time-restricted eating (a type of intermittent fasting) and the risk of death from cardiovascular disease. The analysis -- which has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in an academic journal -- is based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#x27;s National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey collected between 2003 and 2018. The researchers analyzed responses from around 20,000 adults who recorded what they ate for at least two days, then looked at who had died from cardiovascular disease after a median follow-up period of eight years. However, Victor Wenze Zhong, a co-author of the analysis, said it&#x27;s too early to make specific recommendations about intermittent fasting based on his research alone.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Reddit, the social media platform gearing up for an initial public offering this week, said Nokia has accused it of infringing some of their patents. Nokia Technologies, the company&#x27;s licensing business, sent Reddit a letter on Monday with the claims, and Reddit is evaluating them, according to a filing made Tuesday. Nokia&#x27;s claims come as Reddit prepares for an initial public offering in an effort to raise hundreds of millions of dollars. The company has been working toward a listing for years, and its public market debut this week is set to become a high-profile addition to the year&#x27;s roster of newly and soon-to-be public companies. Reddit said in the filing: &quot;On March 18, 2024, Nokia sent us a letter indicating they believed that Reddit infringes certain of their patents. We will evaluate their claims. As we face increasing competition and become increasingly high profile, the possibility of receiving more intellectual property claims against us grows. 

In addition, various &#x27;non-practicing entities,&#x27; and other intellectual property rights holders have asserted in the past, and may attempt to assert in the future, intellectual property claims against us and have sought, and may attempt to seek in the future, to monetize the intellectual property rights they own to extract value through licensing arrangements or other settlements.&quot;

                              <span>Ethiopia&#x27;s biggest commercial bank is scrambling to recoup large sums of money withdrawn by customers after a &quot;systems glitch.&quot; From a report: The customers discovered early on Saturday that they could take out more cash than they had in their accounts at the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE). More than $40m was withdrawn or transferred to other banks, local media reported. 

It took several hours for the institution to freeze transactions. Much of the money was withdrawn from state-owned CBE by students, bank president Abe Sano told journalists on Monday. News of the glitch spread across universities largely via messaging apps and phone calls. Long lines formed at campus ATMs, with a student in western Ethiopia telling BBC Amharic people were withdrawing money until police officers arrived on campus to stop them.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from TorrentFreak: Back in 2004, in the pre-Web 2.0 era, research indicated that BitTorrent was responsible for an impressive 35% of all Internet traffic. At the time, file-sharing via peer-to-peer networks was the main traffic driver as no other services consumed large amounts of bandwidth. Fast-forward two decades and these statistics are ancient history. With the growth of video streaming, including services such as YouTube, Netflix, and TikTok, file-sharing traffic is nothing more than a drop in today&#x27;s data pool. [...]
 
This week, Canadian broadband management company Sandvine released its latest Global Internet Phenomena Report which makes it clear that BitTorrent no longer leads any charts. The latest data show that video and social media are the leading drivers of downstream traffic, accounting for more than half of all fixed access and mobile data worldwide. Needless to say, BitTorrent is nowhere to be found in the list of &#x27;top apps&#x27;. Looking at upstream traffic, BitTorrent still has some relevance on fixed access networks where it accounts for 4% of the bandwidth. However, it&#x27;s been surpassed by cloud storage apps, FaceTime, Google, and YouTube. On mobile connections, BitTorrent no longer makes it into the top ten. The average of 46 MB upstream traffic per subscriber shouldn&#x27;t impress any file-sharer. However, since only a small percentage of all subscribers use BitTorrent, the upstream traffic per user is of course much higher.

Cisco says the transaction is expected to be cash flow positive and non-GAAP gross margin accretive in Cisco&#x27;s fiscal year 2025, and non-GAAP EPS accretive in fiscal year 2026. &quot;We are thrilled to officially welcome Splunk to Cisco,&quot; Chuck Robbins, Chair and CEO of Cisco, said in a statement. &quot;As one of the world&#x27;s largest software companies, we will revolutionize the way our customers leverage data to connect and protect every aspect of their organization as we help power and protect the AI revolution.&quot;

                              <span>According to Bloomberg, Sony has paused production of its PlayStation VR 2 virtual reality headset, as sales have &quot;slowed progressively&quot; since its February 2023 launch. Road to VR reports: Citing people familiar with the company&#x27;s plans, Sony has produced &quot;well over 2 million units&quot; since launch, noting that stocks of the $550 headset are building up. The report alleges the surplus is &quot;throughout Sony&#x27;s supply chain,&quot; indicating the issue isn&#x27;t confined to a single location, but is spread across different stages of Sony&#x27;s production and distribution network. This follows news that Sony Interactive Entertainment laid off eight percent of the company, which affected a number of its first-party game studios also involved in VR game production. Sony entirely shuttered its London Studio, which created VR action-adventure game Blood &amp; Truth (2019), and reduced headcount at Firesprite, the studio behind PSVR 2 exclusive Horizon Call of the Mountain.
 
Meanwhile, Sony is making PSVR 2 officially compatible with PC VR games, as the company hopes to release some sort of PC support for the headset later this year. How and when Sony will do that is still unknown, although the move underlines just how little confidence the company has in its future lineup of exclusive content just one year after launch of PSVR 2.

The National Institutes of Health&#x27;s (NIH) nearly five-year study offers no explanation for symptoms including headaches, balance problems and difficulties with thinking and sleep that were first reported in Cuba in 2016 and later by hundreds of American personnel in multiple countries. But it did contradict some earlier findings that raised the spectre of brain injuries in people experiencing what the State Department now calls &quot;anomalous health incidents.&quot;
 
&quot;These individuals have real symptoms and are going through a very tough time,&quot; said Dr. Leighton Chan, NIH&#x27;s chief of rehabilitation medicine, who helped lead the research. &quot;They can be quite profound, disabling and difficult to treat.&quot; Yet sophisticated MRI scans detected no significant differences in brain volume, structure or white matter -- signs of injury or degeneration -- when Havana syndrome patients were compared to healthy government workers with similar jobs, including some in the same embassy. Nor were there significant differences in cognitive and other tests, according to findings published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

                              <span>Leading western and Chinese AI scientists have issued a stark warning that tackling risks around the powerful technology requires global co-operation similar to the cold war effort to avoid nuclear conflict. From a report: A group of renowned international experts met in Beijing last week, where they identified &quot;red lines&quot; on the development of AI, including around the making of bioweapons and launching cyber attacks. In a statement seen by the Financial Times, issued in the days after the meeting, the academics warned that a joint approach to AI safety was needed to stop &quot;catastrophic or even existential risks to humanity within our lifetimes.&quot; 

&quot;In the depths of the cold war, international scientific and governmental co-ordination helped avert thermonuclear catastrophe. Humanity again needs to co-ordinate to avert a catastrophe that could arise from unprecedented technology,&quot; the statement said. Signatories include Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, who won a Turing Award for their work on neural networks and are often described as &quot;godfathers&quot; of AI; Stuart Russell, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley; and Andrew Yao, one of China&#x27;s most prominent computer scientists. The statement followed the International Dialogue on AI Safety in Beijing last week, a meeting that included officials from the Chinese government in a signal of tacit official endorsement for the forum and its outcomes.

                              <span>U.S. Supreme Court justices on Monday appeared skeptical of a challenge on free speech grounds to how President Joe Biden&#x27;s administration encouraged social media platforms to remove posts that federal officials deemed misinformation, including about elections and COVID-19. From a report: The justices heard oral arguments in the administration&#x27;s appeal of a lower court&#x27;s preliminary injunction constraining how White House and certain other federal officials communicate with social media platforms.
The Republican-led states of Missouri and Louisiana, along with five individual social media users, sued the administration. 

They argued that the government&#x27;s actions violated the U.S. Constitution&#x27;s First Amendment free speech rights of users whose posts were removed from platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter, now called X. The case tests whether the administration crossed the line from mere communication and persuasion to strong arming or coercing platforms - sometimes called &quot;jawboning&quot; - to unlawfully censor disfavored speech, as lower courts found.

                              <span>Soon you might be able to compete in games against friends and colleagues and even the office next door on LinkedIn. From a report: The Microsoft-owned company is reportedly planning to add a new game experience to the platform. According to TechCrunch, the experience is designed to tap into the same popularity of games like Wordle. Players&#x27; scores will be sorted by their workplace and ranked, allowing you to take on another office or even across the country. App researcher Nima Owji posted photos of the gaming experience on Twitter/X on Saturday. A representative from LinkedIn confirmed to TechCrunch that the company is working on adding puzzle-based games to the LinkedIn experience as a way to &quot;unlock a bit of fun, deepen relationships, and hopefully spark the opportunity for conversations.&quot;

                              <span>Two investment advisors have reached settlements with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly exaggerating their use of AI, which in both cases were purported to be cornerstones of their offerings. From a report: Canada-based Delphia and San Francisco-headquartered Global Predictions will cough up $225,000 and $175,000 respectively for telling clients that their products used AI to improve forecasts. The financial watchdog said both were engaging in &quot;AI washing,&quot; a term used to describe the embellishment of machine-learning capabilities. 

&quot;We&#x27;ve seen time and again that when new technologies come along, they can create buzz from investors as well as false claims by those purporting to use those new technologies,&quot; said SEC chairman Gary Gensler. &quot;Delphia and Global Predictions marketed to their clients and prospective clients that they were using AI in certain ways when, in fact, they were not.&quot; Delphia claimed its system utilized AI and machine learning to incorporate client data, a statement the SEC said it found to be false. 

&quot;Delphia represented that it used artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze its retail clients&#x27; spending and social media data to inform its investment advice when, in fact, no such data was being used in its investment process,&quot; the SEC said in a settlement order. Despite being warned about suspected misleading practices in 2021 and agreeing to amend them, Delphia only partially complied, according to the SEC. The company continued to market itself as using client data as AI inputs but never did anything of the sort, the regulator said.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: The Apex Legends Global Series is currently in regional finals mode, but the North America finals have been delayed after two players were hacked mid-match. First, Noyan &quot;Genburten&quot; Ozkose of DarkZero suddenly found himself able to see other players through walls, then Phillip &quot;ImperialHal&quot; Dosen of TSM was given an aimbot. Genburten&#x27;s hack happened part of the way through the day&#x27;s third match. A Twitch clip of the moment shows the words &quot;Apex hacking global series by Destroyer2009 &amp; R4ndom&quot; repeating over chat as he realizes he&#x27;s been given a cheat and takes his hands off the controls. &quot;I can see everyone!&quot; he says, before leaving the match. 

ImperialHal was hacked in the game immediately after that. &quot;I have aimbot right now!&quot; he shouts in a clip of the moment, before declaring &quot;I can&#x27;t shoot.&quot; Though he continued attempting to play out the round, the match was later abandoned. The volunteers at the Anti-Cheat Police Department have since issued a PSA announcing, &quot;There is currently an RCE exploit being abused in [Apex Legends]&quot; and that it could be delivered via from the game itself, or its anti-cheat protection. &quot;I would advise against playing any games protected by EAC or any EA titles&quot;, they went on to say. 

As for players of the tournament, they strongly recommended taking protective measures. &quot;It is advisable that you change your Discord passwords and ensure that your emails are secure. also enable MFA for all your accounts if you have not done it yet&quot;, they said, &quot;perform a clean OS reinstall as soon as possible. Do not take any chances with your personal information, your PC may have been exposed to a rootkit or other malicious software that could cause further damage.&quot; The rest of the series has now been postponed, &quot;Due to the competitive integrity of this series being compromised,&quot; as the official Twitter account announced. They finished by saying, &quot;We will share more information soon.&quot;

                              <span>Published scientific papers include language that appears to have been generated by AI-tools like ChatGPT, showing how pervasive the technology has become, and highlighting longstanding issues with some peer-reviewed journals. From a report: Searching for the phrase &quot;As of my last knowledge update&quot; on Google Scholar, a free search tool that indexes articles published in academic journals, returns 115 results. The phrase is often used by OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT to indicate when the data the answer it is giving users is coming from, and the specific months and years found in these academic papers correspond to previous ChatGPT &quot;knowledge updates.&quot; 

&quot;As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, there is no widely accepted scientific correlation between quantum entanglement and longitudinal scalar waves,&quot; reads a paper titled &quot;Quantum Entanglement: Examining its Nature and Implications&quot; published in the &quot;Journal of Material Sciences &amp; Manfacturing [sic] Research,&quot; a publication that claims it&#x27;s peer-reviewed. Over the weekend, a tweet showing the same AI-generated phrase appearing in several scientific papers went viral. 

Most of the scientific papers I looked at that included this phrase are small, not well known, and appear to be &quot;paper mills,&quot; journals with low editorial standards that will publish almost anything quickly. One publication where I found the AI-generated phrase, the Open Access Research Journal of Engineering and Technology, advertises &quot;low publication charges,&quot; an &quot;e-certificate&quot; of publication, and is currently advertising a call for papers, promising acceptance within 48 hours and publication within four days.

                              <span>Multinational technology giant Fujitsu confirmed a cyberattack in a statement Friday, and warned that hackers may have stolen personal data and customer information. From a report: &quot;We confirmed the presence of malware on multiple work computers at our company, and as a result of an internal investigation, we discovered that files containing personal information and customer information could be illegally taken out,&quot; said Fujitsu in its statement on its website, translated from Japanese. 

Fujitsu said it disconnected the affected systems from its network, and is investigating how its network was compromised by malware and &quot;whether information has been leaked.&quot; The tech conglomerate did not specify what kind of malware was used, or the nature of the cyberattack. Fujitsu also did not say what kind of personal information may have been stolen, or who the personal information pertains to -- such as its employees, corporate customers, or citizens whose governments use the company&#x27;s technologies.

                              <span>Google researchers have developed a new AI system that can generate lifelike videos of people speaking, gesturing and moving -- from just a single still photo. From a report: The technology, called VLOGGER, relies on advanced machine learning models to synthesize startlingly realistic footage, opening up a range of potential applications while also raising concerns around deepfakes and misinformation. Described in a research paper titled &quot;VLOGGER: Multimodal Diffusion for Embodied Avatar Synthesis,&quot; (PDF) the AI model can take a photo of a person and an audio clip as input, and then output a video that matches the audio, showing the person speaking the words and making corresponding facial expressions, head movements and hand gestures. The videos are not perfect, with some artifacts, but represent a significant leap in the ability to animate still images. 

The researchers, led by Enric Corona at Google Research, leveraged a type of machine learning model called diffusion models to achieve the novel result. Diffusion models have recently shown remarkable performance at generating highly realistic images from text descriptions. By extending them into the video domain and training on a vast new dataset, the team was able to create an AI system that can bring photos to life in a highly convincing way. &quot;In contrast to previous work, our method does not require training for each person, does not rely on face detection and cropping, generates the complete image (not just the face or the lips), and considers a broad spectrum of scenarios (e.g. visible torso or diverse subject identities) that are critical to correctly synthesize humans who communicate,&quot; the authors wrote.

                              <span>xAI has opened sourced its large language model Grok. From a report: The move, which Musk had previously proclaimed would happen this week, now enables any other entrepreneur, programmer, company, or individual to take Grok&#x27;s weights -- the strength of connections between the model&#x27;s artificial &quot;neurons,&quot; or software modules that allow the model to make decisions and accept inputs and provide outputs in the form of text -- and other associated documentation and use a copy of the model for whatever they&#x27;d like, including for commercial applications. 

&quot;We are releasing the base model weights and network architecture of Grok-1, our large language model,&quot; the company announced in a blog post. &quot;Grok-1 is a 314 billion parameter Mixture-of-Experts model trained from scratch by xAI.&quot; Those interested can download the code for Grok on its Github page or via a torrent link. Parameters refers to the weights and biases that govern the model -- the more parameters, generally the more advanced, complex and performant the model is. At 314 billion parameters, Grok is well ahead of open source competitors such as Meta&#x27;s Llama 2 (70 billion parameters) and Mistral 8x7B (12 billion parameters). Grok was open sourced under an Apache License 2.0, which enables commercial use, modifications, and distribution, though it cannot be trademarked and there is no liability or warranty that users receive with it. In addition, they must reproduce the original license and copyright notice, and state the changes they&#x27;ve made.

From the report: The two companies are in active negotiations to let Apple license Gemini, Google&#x27;s set of generative AI models, to power some new features coming to the iPhone software this year, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. Apple also recently held discussions with OpenAI and has considered using its model, according to the people.

                              <span>A PBS reporter &quot;digs into a new report covering the plastic industry&#x27;s tactics to push recycling — and avoid regulation,&quot; according to a new video from PBS News Weekend:

A new report by the Center for Climate Integrity, an environmentalist group, says newly uncovered statements from oil and plastics executives underscore the industry&#x27;s decades-long secret skepticism about the viability and efficacy of recycling. The authors of the report reviewed old investigations and new documents, including previously unknown assertions from industry executives. In 1994, one Exxon Chemical executive put the industry&#x27;s support for plastics recycling in blunt terms, saying &quot;we are committed to the activities, but not committed to the results.&quot; 

Another representative from Dupont noted in 1992 that recyc…</span>

                              <span>Mozilla Location Service offered &quot;a free, open way to offer GPS-style location detection features&quot; for developers on devices without GPS hardware, remembers the Linux blog OMG Ubuntu. It used signals like Wi-Fi access points and Bluetooth beacons &quot;without any of the privacy implications most competing geolocation services have.&quot; 

But Friday they reported that Mozilla &quot;has announced it is ending access to Mozilla Location Service (MLS), which provides accurate, privacy-respecting, and crowdsourced geolocation data.&quot;

Developers and 3rd-party projects that use MLS to detect a users&#x27; location, such as the freedesktop.org location framework GeoClue, which is used by apps like GNOME Maps and Weather, have only a few months left to continue using the service... In late March, POST data submissions will return 403 responses. Finally, on June 12, all 3rd-party API keys will be removed and MLS data only accessible by Mozilla... 


MLS&#x27; accuracy has declined in recent years. Patent infringement claims in 2019 saw Mozilla reach a settlement to avoid litigation. As part of that settlement it was forced to make changes to MLS that impacted its ability to invest in (commercially exploit?) and improve the service. 

The article notes that GeoClue &quot;already supports multiple location detection methods, including IP-based ones,&quot; so it should continue operating. 

&quot;But the sad reality is that there just aren&#x27;t a lot of free, open, privacy-friendly, accurate, and (rather importantly for a framework built in to Linux desktops) reliable alternatives to Mozilla Location Services, which has built up a colossal &#x27;signal map&#x27; from which to pinpoint locations.&quot; 

&quot;We are grateful for the contributions of the community to MLS to both the code and the dataset,&quot; a Mozilla senior engineering manager said in a statement.

The site calls it &quot;one of the most abrupt changes to remote work policies,&quot; noting that Dell &quot;has had a hybrid working culture in place for more than a decade — long before the pandemic struck.&quot;

 &quot;Dell cared about the work, not the location,&quot; a senior employee at Dell who&#x27;s worked remotely for more than a decade, told Business Insider last month. &quot;I would say 10% to 15% of every team was remote.&quot; That flexibility has enabled staff to sustain their careers in the face of major life changes, several employees told BI. It has also helped Dell to be placed on the &quot;Best Place to Work for Disability Equality Index&quot; since 2018. But in February Dell introduced a strict return-to-office mandat…</span>

After 20 years of development, the open source GnuCOBOL &quot;has reached an industrial maturity and can compete with proprietary offers in all environments,&quot; said OCamlPro founder and GnuCOBOL contributor Fabrice Le Fessant, in a FOSDEM talk about the technology. GnuCOBOL turns COBOL source code into executable applications. It is very cross-platform, running Linux, BSD, many proprietary Unixes, macOS, and Windows, even Android. And the latest version, v.32, is being used in many commercial settings... 

Sobisch noted that the GnuCOBOL is seeing a lot of commercial deployments, such as for banking back-end apps, many of which are being migrated from Micro Focus, with users reporting performance improvements as a result. The French DGFIP federal agency moved from a GCOS mainframe to GnuCOBOL, with the help of Le Fessant&#x27;s firm. 

Originally called OpenCOBOL, the project was started in 2002 and renamed GnuCOBOL in 2013. In the past three years, it has received attention from 13 contributors with 460 commits. Most Linux package managers have a copy of GnuCOBOL for the program for downloading... It can compile to C code (C89+), making it extremely portable, from mainframes to Raspberry Pi&#x27;s, Sobisch said... 

Also new is SuperBOL, a development studio for GnuCOBOL developed by Le Fessant&#x27;s OCamlPro. It runs as a VSCode Extension and features a full COBOL processor (written in OCaml).

                              <span>The Street interviewed Chad Anderson, founder/managing partner of the &quot;space economy&quot; investment firm Space Capital, who calls SpaceX&#x27;s progress &quot;unprecedented,&quot; and believes their next launch could carry &quot;operational&quot; payloads like Starlink satellites.


Anderson added that Starship reaching orbital velocity and reentering the atmosphere at those speeds (roughly 16,000 miles per hour) was &quot;a really big deal,&quot; though it&#x27;s specifically important for the reusability of the vehicle, which would further cheapen the cost of launch. 

&quot;The fact that they did all those things and they can now move into operations as an investor is hugely important and significant,&quot; Anderson said. &quot;Having an operational Starship vehicle is really important because, at the moment, they just can&#x27;t launch Starlink sa…</span>

                              <span>A new EFF web page is urging U.S. readers to &quot;Tell Congress: Stop the TikTok Ban,&quot; arguing the bill will &quot;do little for its alleged goal of protecting our private information and the collection of our data by foreign governments.&quot;

Tell Congress: Instead of giving the President the power to ban entire social media platforms based on their country of origin, our representatives should focus on what matters — protecting our data no matter who is collecting it... It&#x27;s a massive problem that current U.S. law allows for all the big social media platforms to harvest and monetize our personal data, including TikTok. Without comprehensive data privacy legislation, this will continue, and this ban won&#x27;t solve any real or perceived problems. User data will still be collected by numerous platforms and sold to data brokers who sell it to the highest bidder — including governments of countries such as China — just as it is now. 

TikTok raises special concerns, given the surveillance and censorship practices of the country that its parent company is based in, China. But it&#x27;s also used by hundreds of millions of people to express themselves online, and is an instrumental tool for community building and holding those in power accountable. The U.S. government has not justified silencing the speech of Americans who use TikTok, nor has it justified the indirect speech punishment of a forced sale (which may prove difficult if not impossible to accomplish in the required timeframe). It can&#x27;t meet the high constitutional bar for a restriction on the platform, which would undermine the free speech and association rights of millions of people. This bill must be stopped.

                              <span>America&#x27;s National Transportation Safety Board &quot;is investigating a fatal crash in San Antonio, Texas, involving a Ford electric vehicle that may have been using a partially automated driving system,&quot; reports the Associated Press:

The NTSB said that preliminary information shows a Ford Mustang Mach-E SUV equipped with the company&#x27;s partially automated driving system collided with the rear of a Honda CR-V that was stopped in one of the highway lanes. 

Television station KSAT reported that the Mach-E driver told police the Honda was stopped in the middle lane with no lights on before the crash around 9:50 p.m. The 56-year-old driver of the CR-V was killed. &quot;NTSB is investigating this fatal crash due to its continued interest in advanced driver assistance systems and how vehicle operators interact with these technologies,&quot; the agency statement said. 

Ford&#x27;s Blue Cruise system allows drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel while it handles steering, braking and acceleration on highways. The company says the system isn&#x27;t fully autonomous and it monitors drivers to make sure they pay attention to the road. It operates on 97% of controlled access highways in the U.S. and Canada, Ford says.

                              <span>After the mysterious disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, barnacles offer &quot;a potential breakthrough&quot; in the search for its wreckage, reports WION:


These barnacles were discovered clinging to the initial piece of debris conclusively linked to MH370 — a flaperon bearing the distinctive marking &quot;657 BB,&quot; which washed ashore on Reunion Island, situated off the coast of Africa, a year following the event... 

 Scientists now posit that barnacles could provide invaluable insights into solving this mystery. These small creatures offer a unique biological record akin to the growth rings found in trees. Researchers speculate that by deciphering this information, it may be feasible to retrace the barnacles&#x27; trajectory along the flaperon, potentially leading investigators to the crash site.
 

This week the Independent also reported a new theory from a British pilot:

Simon Hardy believes that the Malaysian Airlines flight plan and technical log reveal last-minute changes to the cargo including an additional 3,000kg of fuel and extra oxygen that indicate Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah directed the plane &quot;to oblivion... It&#x27;s a strange coincidence that the last engineering task that was done before it headed off to oblivion was topping up crew oxygen which is only for the cockpit, not for the cabin crew....&quot; 

Hardy also said that the flaperon found on Reunion Island indicates there was an active pilot until the end of the flight: &quot;If the flaps were down, there is a liquid fuel, then someone is moving a lever and it&#x27;s someone who knows what they are doing. It all points to the same scenario.&quot; 

In a kind of rebuttal, long-time Slashdot reader Maury Markowitz suggests there&#x27;s more innocent explanations for the extra fuel and oxygen, arguing that Hardy&#x27;s theory &quot;sounds like yet more balonium from someone who likes being in the newspapers.&quot;

By a variety of measures and in a variety of countries, the members of Generation Z (born in and after 1996) are suffering from anxiety, depression, self-harm, and related disorders at levels higher than any other generation for which we have data...

                              <span>&quot;Pornhub has disabled its site in Texas,&quot; reports the Hill, &quot;to object to a state law that requires the company to verify the age of users to prevent minors from accessing the site.&quot;

Texas residents who visit the site are met with a message from the company that criticizes the state&#x27;s elected officials who are requiring them to track the age of users. The company said the newly passed law impinges on &quot;the rights of adults to access protected speech&quot; and fails to pass strict scrutiny by &quot;employing the least effective and yet also most restrictive means of accomplishing Texas&#x27;s stated purpose of allegedly protecting minors.&quot;

Pornhub said safety and compliance are &quot;at the forefront&quot; of the company&#x27;s mission, but having users provide identification every time they want to access the site is &quot;not an effective solution for protecting users online... Attempting to mandate age verification without any means to enforce at scale gives platforms the choice to comply or not, leaving thousands of platforms open and accessible,&quot; the message said, adding that &quot;very few sites are able to compare the robust Trust and Safety measures we currently have in place.&quot;
 
The article adds that the state&#x27;s attorney general is suing the owners of Pornhub for $1.6 million failing to enact age verification, plus an additional $10,000 a day.

                              <span>Pi was calculated to 100 trillion decimal places in 2022 by a Google team lead by cloud developer advocate Emma Haruka Iwao. 

But 2024&#x27;s &quot;pi day&quot; saw a new announcement...


After successfully breaking the speed record for calculating pi to 100 trillion digits last year, the team at StorageReview has taken it up a notch, revealing all the numbers of Pi up to 105 trillion digits! Spoiler: the 105 trillionth digit of Pi is 6! 

Owner and Editor-in-Chief Brian Beeler led the team that used 36 Solidigm SSDs (nearly a petabyte) for their unprecedented capacity and reliability required to store the calculated digits of Pi. Although there is no practical application for this many digits, the exercise underscores the astounding capabilities of modern hardware and an achievement in computational and storage technology... 

For an undertaking of this size, which took 75 days, the role of storage cannot be understated. &quot;For the Pi computation, we&#x27;re entirely restricted by storage, says Beeler. &quot;Faster CPUs will help accelerate the math, but the limiting factor to many new world records is the amount of local storage in the box. For this run, we&#x27;re again leveraging Solidigm D5-P5316 30.72TB SSDs to help us get a little over 1P flash in the system. 

&quot;These SSDs are the only reason we could break through the prior records and hit 105 trillion Pi digits.&quot; 

&quot;Leveraging a combination of open-source and proprietary software, the team at StorageReview optimized the algorithmic process to fully exploit the hardware&#x27;s capabilities, reducing computational time and enhancing efficiency,&quot; Beeler says in the announcement. 

There&#x27;s a video on YouTubewhere the team discusses their effort.

&quot;It&#x27;s just Microsoft doing a bad job of trying to get you to switch to its products.&quot; 

The Register explains:

[W]hile using Google&#x27;s desktop browser on Windows 10 or 11, a dialog box suddenly and irritatingly appears to the side of the screen urging folks to make Microsoft&#x27;s Bing the default search engine in Chrome. Not only that, netizens are told they can use Chrome to interact with Bing&#x27;s OpenAI GPT-4-powered chat bot, allowing them to ask questions and get answers using natural language. We can forgive those who thought this was malware at first glance. &quot;Chat with GPT-4 for f…</span>

                              <span>&quot;A pet company has twice sent back dog breed results for human swab samples,&quot; reports the Guardian, &quot;prompting doubts surrounding the accuracy of dog breed tests.&quot;


On Wednesday, WBZ News reported its investigations team receiving dog breed results from the company DNA My Dog after one of its reporters sent in a swab sample — from her own cheek. According to the results from the Toronto-based company, WBZ News reporter Christina Hager is 40% Alaskan malamute, 35% shar-pei and 25% labrador. 

Hager also sent her samples to two other pet genetic testing companies. The Melbourne, Australia- and Florida-based company Orivet reported that the sample &quot;failed to provide the data necessary to perform the breed ID analysis&quot;. Meanwhile, Washington-based company Wisdom Panel said that the sample &quot;didn&#x27;t provide ... enough DNA to produce a reliable result&quot;... 

The global dog DNA test market, which was valued at $235m in 2022, is projected to grow to $723m by 2030, according to Zion Market Research. The industry&#x27;s main players include DNA My Dog, Orivet and Wisdom Panel, among others. 

But faulty results have cast doubt on the accuracy of the DNA tests.

[T]hey hope to fix a communication issue with the aging spacecraft that has persisted for five months. Launched in 1977, Voyager 1 and its twin, Voyager 2, are venturing through uncharted cosmic territory along the outer reaches of the solar system. While Voyager 1 has continued to relay a steady radio signal to its mission control team on Earth, that signal has not carried any usable data since November, which has pointed to an issue with one of the spacecraft&#x27;s three onboard computers...

The employees have been demanding higher pay, more flexible schedules and safer working conditions since 2022. After a months-long investigation, the National Labor Relations Board issued a complaint against Amazon last week, alleging the e-commerce behemoth illegally attempted to curtail those efforts by interrogating workers, threatening to call the police on them and demoting workers involved in union organizing. 

The complaint is a victory for union organizers at a crucial air cargo hub in Kentucky who have been alleging that Amazon has been unfairly interfering …</span>

                              <span>The Washington Post reports:


Nearly a decade ago, Congress passed a law that allows private American space companies the rights to resources they mine on celestial bodies, including the moon. 

Now, there&#x27;s a private venture that says it intends to do just that. 

Founded by a pair of former executives from Blue Origin, the space venture founded by Jeff Bezos, and an Apollo astronaut, the company, Interlune, announced itself publicly Wednesday by saying it has raised $18 million and is developing the technology to harvest and bring materials back from the moon... Specifically, Interlune is focused on Helium-3, a stable isotope that is scarce on Earth but plentiful on the moon and could be used as fuel in nuclear fusion reactors as well as helping power the quantum computing industry.

                              <span>A Boeing 737-800 &quot;was discovered to be missing an external panel&quot; on the bottom of its fuselage, reports CNN, &quot;after it landed in Medford, Oregon, Friday afternoon after taking off from San Francisco.&quot; 

They stress that it&#x27;s not a 737 Max, but the previous generation of Boeing aircraft.

The plane carrying 145 passengers and crew landed safely and was parked at the gate at Rogue Valley International Medford Airport when a person on the ground first noticed the panel was missing, United Airlines said in a statement. The crew of Flight 433 did not declare an emergency and there was no indication of the damage during the flight, the airline said... 

United said the missing panel did not affect the flying characteristics of the airplane... 

 Rogue Valley International-Medford Airport Director Amber Judd indicated to the Rogue Valley Times the aircraft is not in condition to fly and &quot;will be here for a while.&quot; Judd added it is unclear where the missing panel is. 

&quot;They don&#x27;t know where they lost it,&quot; Judd told the RV Times.
 

&quot;The Federal Aviation Administration said it will investigate the incident.&quot; 

Yahoo Finance notes that shares of Boeing &quot;have declined over 30% in 2024.&quot;

&quot;Then, because it was too much work with too little support, the Linux kernel developers decided to no longer support the older kernels.&quot;

Greg Kroah-Hartman, the Linux kernel maintainer for the stable branch, announced that the Linux 4.14.336 release was the last maintenance update to the six-year-old LTS Linux 4.14 kernel series. It was the last of the line for 4.14. Or was it? 


Kroah-Hartman had stated, &quot;All users of the 4.14 kernel series must upgrade.&quot; Maybe not. OpenELA, a trade association of the Linux distributors CIQ (the company backing Rocky Linux), Oracle, and SUSE, is now offering — via its kernel-lts — a new lease …</span>

                              <span>When it comes to TikTok, &quot;The Chinese government is signaling that it won&#x27;t allow a forced sale...&quot; reported the Wall Street Journal Friday, &quot;limiting options for the app&#x27;s owners as buyers begin lining up to bid for its U.S. operations...&quot; 

&quot;They have also sent signals to TikTok&#x27;s owner, Beijing-based ByteDance, that company executives have interpreted as meaning the government would rather the app be banned in the U.S. than be sold, according to people familiar with the matter.&quot; 

But that&#x27;s not always how it plays out. McClatchy notes that in 2019 the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. ordered Grindr&#x27;s Chinese owners to relinquish control of Grindr. &quot;A year later, the Chinese owners voluntarily complied and sold the company to San Vicente Acquisition, incorporated in Delaware,…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from the New York Times: When Romeo Chicco tried to get auto insurance in December, seven different companies rejected him. When he eventually obtained insurance, it was nearly double the rate he was previously paying. According to a federal complaint filed this week seeking class-action status, it was because his 2021 Cadillac XT6 had been spying on him. Modern cars have been called &quot;smartphones with wheels,&quot; because they are connected to the internet and packed with sensors and cameras. According to the complaint, an agent at Liberty Mutual told Mr. Chicco that he had been rejected because of information in his &quot;LexisNexis report.&quot; LexisNexis Risk Solutions, a data broker, has traditionally kept tabs for insurers on drivers&#x27; moving violations, prior insurance coverage and accidents.
 
When Mr. Chicco requested his LexisNexis file, it contained details about 258 trips he had taken in his Cadillac over the past six months. His file included the distance he had driven, when the trips started and ended, and an accounting of any speeding and hard braking or accelerating. The data had been provided by General Motors -- the manufacturer of his Cadillac. In a complaint against General Motors and LexisNexis Risk Solutions filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Mr. Chicco accused the companies of violation of privacy and consumer protection laws. The lawsuit follows a report by The New York Times that, unknown to consumers, automakers have been sharing information on their driving behavior with the insurance industry, resulting in increased insurance rates for some drivers.

                              <span>Emily Dreibelbis reports via PCMag: Etsy&#x27;s reputation as a haven for small, independent creators has come into question as tools like Midjourney have made it easy to list art without disclosing that it&#x27;s been AI-generated, and shoppers are not happy. &quot;The fact that it&#x27;s AI isn&#x27;t listed anywhere,&quot; says one Reddit user who purchased a stock photo on Etsy that seemed suspiciously low cost with glowing reviews. &quot;I was so mad at myself for not noticing it was AI before purchasing.&quot; [...] &quot;Being avid user of Etsy, I really enjoy supporting small businesses and the talent that goes into their work,&quot; the buyer tells PCMag in a private message. &quot;Shops such as we discussed selling massive amounts of AI-generated images take away from genuine sellers who put hours into perfecting their craft.&quot;
 
Etsy&#x27;s seller policy does not mention artificial intelligence. The platform is still determining the place AI-generated works have on the site, a source tells PCMag. Complicating matters, some sellers take AI-generated images and modify them, adding a hint of human artistry. Etsy also has a policy regarding when sellers can claim an item is &quot;handmade,&quot; but it also does not mention AI and appears virtually unenforceable. [...] Beyond the legalities, Etsy shoppers debate the ethical and economic implications. One argues it devalues the work, citing an ancient example of explorer Mansa Musa handing out fake gold during his travels, inflating the overall supply and tanking the market. If anyone can create art at the push of a button, what defines an artist&#x27;s work? And what role does Etsy play in answering that question?

Space.com reports: The new map of this central region of the Milky Way, which took four years to assemble, reveals the relationship between magnetic fields at the heart of our galaxy and the cold dust structures that dwell there. This dust forms the building blocks of stars, planets, and, ultimately, life as we know it. The central engine of the Milky Way drives this process. That means a clearer picture of dust and magnetic interactions builds a better understanding of the Milky Way and our place within it. The team&#x27;s findings also have implications beyond our galaxy, offering glimpses of how dust and magnetic fields interact in the central…</span>

Danish wind energy developer Orsted and the utility Eversource built a 12-turbine wind farm called South Fork Wind 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of Montauk Point, New York. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul went to Long Island Thursday to announce that the turbines are delivering clean power to the local electric grid, flipping a massive light switch to &quot;turn on the future.&quot; Interior Secretary Deb Haaland was also on hand.

                              <span>Alex Koller reports via CNBC: Since the start of the year, more than 50,000 workers have been laid off from over 200 tech companies, according to tracking website Layoffs.fyi. It&#x27;s a continuation of the predominant theme of 2023, when more than 260,000 workers across nearly 1,200 tech companies lost their jobs. Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft have all taken part in the downsizing this year, along with eBay, Unity Software, SAP and Cisco. Wall Street has largely cheered on the cost-cutting, sending many tech stocks to record highs on optimism that spending discipline coupled with efficiency gains from artificial intelligence will lead to rising profits. PayPal announced in January that it was eliminating 9% of its workforce, or about 2,500 jobs.
 
All told, 2023 was the second-biggest year of cuts on record in the technology sector, behind only the dot-com crash in 2001, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas. Not since the spectacular flameouts of Pets.com, eToys and Webvan have so many tech workers lost their jobs in such a short period of time. Last month&#x27;s job cut count was the highest of any February since 2009, when the financial crisis forced companies into cash preservation mode.
 
CNBC spoke to a dozen people who have been laid off from tech jobs in the past year or so about their experiences navigating the labor market. Some spoke on the condition that CNBC not use their names or write about the details of their situation. Taken together, they paint a picture of an increasingly competitive market with job listings that include exacting requirements for qualification and come with lower pay than their prior gigs. It&#x27;s a particularly confounding situation for software developers and data scientists, who just a couple of years ago had some of the most marketable and highly valued skills on the planet, and are now considering whether they need to exit the industry to find employment.

                              <span>Days before Reddit&#x27;s upcoming initial public offering (IPO), the company announced that the FTC has launched an inquiry into the company&#x27;s licensing of user data to AI companies. Reddit says that it&#x27;s &quot;not surprised&quot; by the FTC&#x27;s inquiry, given the novel nature of these agreements. Axios reports: Reddit says it received a letter on Thursday, March 14, in which the FTC said it&#x27;s &quot;conducting a non-public inquiry focused on our sale, licensing, or sharing of user-generated content with third parties to train AI models.&quot; The FTC also is expected to request a meeting with Reddit, plus various documents and information. Reddit isn&#x27;t the only company receiving these so-called &quot;hold letters,&quot; according to a former FTC official who spoke with Axios on background.

                              <span>According to Bloomberg, Apple has acquired Canada-based AI startup DarwinAI for an undisclosed sum. Macworld reports: Apple has reportedly folded the DarwinAI staff into its own AI team, including DarwinAI co-founder Alexander Wong, an AI researcher at the University of Waterloo who &quot;has published over 600 refereed journal and conference papers, as well as patents, in various fields such as computational imaging, artificial intelligence, computer vision, and multimedia systems.&quot;
 
According to its LinkedIn profile, DarwinAI is &quot;a rapidly growing visual quality inspection company providing manufacturers an end-to-end solution to improve product quality and increase production efficiency.&quot; In layman&#x27;s terms, that means Apple is likely interested in DarwinAI to streamline its manufacturing to be more efficient. That&#x27;s something that could save Apple a ton of money in annual costs.
 
Far more interesting to our consumer devices, however, is Bloomberg&#x27;s report that DarwinAI&#x27;s tech can be used to make AI models more efficient in general. Apple has been said to want any generative AI features to run on the device rather than the cloud, so models will need to be as small as possible and DarwinAI could definitely help there. Last month, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the iPhone maker sees &quot;incredible breakthrough potential for generative AI, which is why we&#x27;re currently investing significantly in this area. We believe that will unlock transformative opportunities for users when it comes to productivity, problem solving and more.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from BleepingComputer: McDonald&#x27;s restaurants are suffering global IT outages that prevent employees from taking orders and accepting payments, causing some stores to close for the day. The outages started overnight and are impacting restaurants globally, including those in the USA, Japan, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Italy, New Zealand, and the UK. &quot;We are aware of a technology outage, which impacted our restaurants; the issue is now being resolved,&quot; McDonald&#x27;s said in a statement to BleepingComputer. &quot;We thank customers for their patience and apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Notably, the issue is not related to a cybersecurity event.&quot; In an updated statement, McDonald&#x27;s says that the outage was caused by a third-party provider during a configuration change. &quot;Many markets are back online, and the rest are in the process of coming back online. This issue was not directly caused by a cybersecurity event; rather, it was caused by a third-party provider during a configuration change.&quot;

                              <span>The city council of Minneapolis on Thursday voted 10-3 to allow rideshare drivers to be paid the local minimum wage of $15.57 an hour, overriding the mayor&#x27;s veto of the bill. As a result, Lyft and Uber said they will cease operations in the city. From a report: Lyft said in a statement the bill was &quot;deeply flawed&quot; and that the ordinance makes its &quot;operations unsustainable.&quot; &quot;We support a minimum earning standard for drivers, but it should be done in an honest way that keeps the service affordable for riders,&quot; said a Lyft spokesperson. Uber said in a statement obtained by CNN that it&#x27;s &quot;disappointed the council chose to ignore the data and kick Uber out of the Twin Cities, putting 10,000 people out of work and leaving many stranded.&quot;
 
The ordinance mandates rideshare drivers make at least $1.40 per mile and $0.51 per minute within Minneapolis. However, the analysis Frey referred to showed lower numbers -- $0.89 per mile and $0.49 per minute -- to make minimum wage. The mayor is imploring local politicians to come up with a solution before May 1. The rideshare services say that user prices would double if they stayed in the city.

                              <span>In a blog post Thursday, Broadcom CEO and President Hock Tan acknowledged the discomfort VMware customers and partners have experienced after the sweeping changes that Broadcom has instituted since it acquired the company nearly four months ago. &quot;Of course, we recognize that this level of change has understandably created some unease among our customers and partners,&quot; writes Tan. &quot;But all of these moves have been with the goals of innovating faster, meeting our customers&#x27; needs more effectively, and making it easier to do business with us.&quot; Ars Technica reports: Tan believes that the changes will ultimately &quot;provide greater profitability and improved market opportunities&quot; for channel partners. However, many IT solution provider businesses that were working with VMware have already been disrupted. For example, after buying VMware, Broadcom took over the top 2,000 VMware accounts from VMware channel partners. In a March earnings call, Tan said that Broadcom has been focused on upselling those customers. He also said Broadcom expects VMware revenue to grow double-digits quarter over quarter for the rest of the fiscal year. [...]
 
In his blog post, Tan defended the subscription-only licensing model, calling it &quot;the industry standard.&quot; He said VMware started accelerating its transition to this strategy in 2019, (which is before Broadcom bought VMware). He also linked to a February blog post from VMware&#x27;s Prashanth Shenoy, VP of product and technical marketing for the Cloud, Infrastructure, Platforms, and Solutions group at VMware, that also noted acquisition-related &quot;concerns&quot; but claimed the evolution would be fiscally prudent.

                              <span>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a legal complaint against two companies based in Cyprus on Wednesday that it claims are behind a wave of malicious pop-ups that trick people into downloading a fake piece of antivirus software that generated tens of millions of dollars for its operators, according to court records. From a report: The scam also involved misrepresenting results on malware repository VirusTotal as infections on the user&#x27;s own computer. (Update: after the publication of this piece the FTC announced that Restoro and Reimage will pay $26 million to settle the FTC&#x27;s charges.) 

The move is the latest from the FTC in a series of actions in the privacy and cybersecurity space. In January, the FTC banned a data broker called X-Mode from selling sensitive location data after I revealed it was harvesting location data from Muslim prayer and dating apps. In this case, the FTC says it went &quot;undercover&quot; against the two related companies, called Restoro and Reimage, to buy the deceiving software and have phone calls with company representatives. &quot;Since at least January 2018, Defendants have operated a tech support scheme that has bilked tens of millions of dollars from consumers, particularly older consumers,&quot; the FTC&#x27;s complaint reads. The complaint is seeking a permanent injunction against the two companies as well as monetary relief.

From a report: In a press release today, the company said that it is now selling the base model M1 MacBook Air online and in select stores for $699. The move comes a week after Apple introduced the new M3 MacBook Air and stopped selling the M1 MacBook Air itself. While Walmart has historically sold Apple devices like the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, it has never sold Macs directly. Instead, it&#x27;s relied on third-party partners to sell the Mac through its online marketplace.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: India is walking back on a recent AI advisory after receiving criticism from many local and global entrepreneurs and investors. The Ministry of Electronics and IT shared an updated AI advisory with industry stakeholders on Friday that no longer asked them to take the government approval before launching or deploying an AI model to users in the South Asian market. Under the revised guidelines, firms are instead advised to label under-tested and unreliable AI models to inform users of their potential fallibility or unreliability.
 
The March 1 advisory also marked a reversal from India&#x27;s previous hands-off approach to AI regulation. Less than a year ago, the ministry had declined to regulate AI growth, identifying the sector as vital to India&#x27;s strategic interests. The new advisory, like the original earlier this month, hasn&#x27;t been published online, but TechCrunch has reviewed a copy of it. The ministry said earlier this month that though the advisory wasn&#x27;t legally binding, it signals that it&#x27;s the &quot;future of regulation&quot; and that the government required compliance.
 
The advisory emphasizes that AI models should not be used to share unlawful content under Indian law and should not permit bias, discrimination, or threats to the integrity of the electoral process. Intermediaries are also advised to use &quot;consent popups&quot; or similar mechanisms to explicitly inform users about the unreliability of AI-generated output. The ministry has retained its emphasis on ensuring that deepfakes and misinformation are easily identifiable, advising intermediaries to label or embed content with unique metadata or identifiers. It no longer requires firms to devise a technique to identify the &quot;originator&quot; of any particular message.

                              <span>Sam Bankman-Fried should spend between 40 and 50 years in prison after being convicted for stealing $8 billion from customers of his now-bankrupt FTX cryptocurrency exchange, prosecutors said on Friday. From a report: &quot;His life in recent years has been one of unmatched greed and hubris; of ambition and rationalization; and courting risk and gambling repeatedly with other people&#x27;s money,&quot; federal prosecutors in Manhattan wrote. &quot;And even now Bankman-Fried refuses to admit what he did was wrong.&quot; A jury found Bankman-Fried, 32, guilty in November on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. 

Lawyers for the former billionaire told U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan that a 5-1/4 to 6-1/2 year prison term would be appropriate. They said FTX clients would get most of their money back, and that Bankman-Fried did not set out to steal. Kaplan is scheduled to sentence Bankman-Fried on March 28 in Manhattan federal court. Bankman-Fried plans to appeal his conviction and sentence.

                              <span>Microsoft has been pushing Bing pop-up ads in Chrome on Windows 10 and 11. The new ad once again encourages Chrome users (in bold lettering) to use Bing instead of Google search. From a report: &quot;Chat with GPT-4 for free on Chrome! Get hundreds of daily chat turns with Bing Al,&quot; the ad reads. If you click &quot;Yes,&quot; the pop-up will install the &quot;Bing Search&quot; Chrome extension while making Microsoft&#x27;s search engine the default. 

If you click &quot;Yes&quot; on the ad to switch to Bing, a Chrome pop-up will appear, asking you to confirm that you want to change the browser&#x27;s default search engine. &quot;Did you mean to change your search provider?&quot; the pop-up asks. &quot;The âMicrosoft Bing Search for Chrome&#x27; extension changed search to use bing.com,&#x27;&quot; Chrome&#x27;s warning states. Directly beneath that alert, seemingly in anticipation of Chrome&#x27;s pop-up, another Windows notification warns, &quot;Wait -- don&#x27;t change it back! If you do, you&#x27;ll turn off Microsoft Bing Search for Chrome and lose access to Bing Al with GPT-4 and DALL-E 3. Select Keep it to stay with Microsoft Bing.&quot;

                              <span>Mercedes-Benz is the latest automotive company to trial how humanoid robots could be used to automate &quot;low skill, physically challenging, manual labor.&quot; From a report: On Friday, robotics company Apptronik announced it had entered into a commercial agreement with Mercedes to pilot how &quot;highly advanced robotics&quot; like Apollo -- Apptronik&#x27;s 160-pound bipedal robot -- can be used in manufacturing. The news follows a similar pilot announced by BMW in January. 

Apptronik says that Mercedes is exploring use cases like having Apollo inspect and deliver components to human production line workers. Neither company has disclosed any figures for the agreement or how many Apollo robots are being trialed. According to Apptronik, humanoid robots would allow vehicle manufacturers to start automating manufacturing tasks without having to redesign their existing facilities. The company says its approach instead &quot;centers on automating some physically demanding, repetitive and dull tasks for which it is increasingly hard to find reliable workers.&quot;

                              <span>Apple reached a $490 million settlement of a class-action lawsuit brought by a group of investors who accused Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook of misleading them in 2018 about the company&#x27;s sales prospects. From a report: Cook made false statements about the company&#x27;s business in China that caused Apple stock to trade at artificially inflated prices, the investors said in their complaint, which alleged violation of securities laws. Lawyers disclosed the proposed settlement in a request for judicial approval filed Friday in federal court in Oakland, California. The settlement comes as Apple continues to face headwinds in China, where iPhone sales fell by a surprising 24% over the first six weeks of this year, according to independent research released earlier this month. Attorneys for the investors described the settlement as the third-largest securities class-action recovery in the district&#x27;s history.

                              <span>The Supreme Court clarified when public officials can block critical constituents from their personal profiles without violating their constitutional protections in a unanimous decision Friday. From a report: After hearing appeals of two conflicting rulings -- one filed against school board members in Southern California and another filed against the city manager of Port Huron, Mich. -- the justices provided no definitive resolution to the disputes and instead sent both cases back to lower courts to apply the new legal test. In a unanimous decision authored by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, the court said state officials cannot block constituents on their personal pages when they have &quot;actual authority to speak on behalf of the State on a particular matter&quot; and &quot;purported to exercise that authority in the relevant posts.&quot; 

&quot;For social-media activity to constitute state action, an official must not only have state authority -- he must also purport to use it,&quot; Barrett wrote. The case marked the latest battle over public officials&#x27; social media presence when they mesh their official and personal roles. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard the Michigan case, sided with the city manager, James Freed, who deleted comments on his Facebook page left by a resident and blocked several of the resident&#x27;s profiles. The resident, Kevin Lindke, had criticized Freed over his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, court filings indicate.

                              <span>The FCC passed new rules that will require cable and satellite providers to clearly disclose the &quot;all in&quot; price of subscriptions in promotional materials. From a report: &quot;The advertised price for a service should be the price you pay when your bill arrives,&quot; FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said. &quot;It shouldn&#x27;t include a bunch of unexpected junk fees that are separate from the top-line price you were told when you signed up.&quot; 

Rosenworcel cited fees like &quot;broadcast subscription&quot; and &quot;regional sports assessments.&quot; &quot;It is not just annoying,&quot; she said. &quot;It makes it hard for consumers to compare service in a market that is evolving and has so many new ways to watch.&quot; The new rules passed 3-2. Commissioners Brendan Carr and Nathan Simington voted against it. Rosenworcel has also proposed other measures aimed at &quot;junk fees,&quot; while the White House has focused on the elimination or limitation of things like surcharges and late fees in areas like concert ticketing, airline reservations and banking.

                              <span>Google enjoys a competitive edge in generative AI due to its trove of data and AI-optimised chips, Microsoft has told EU antitrust regulators, underscoring the rivalry between the two tech giants. From a report: The comments by Microsoft were in response to a consultation launched by the European Commission in January on the level of competition in generative AI. The growing popularity of generative AI, which can generate human-like responses to written prompts and is exemplified by Microsoft-backed OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT and Google&#x27;s chatbot Gemini, has triggered concerns about misinformation and fake news. 

&quot;Today, only one company - Google - is vertically integrated in a manner that provides it with strength and independence at every AI layer from chips to a thriving mobile app store. Everyone else must rely on partnerships to innovate and compete,&quot; Microsoft said in its report to the Commission. It said Google&#x27;s self-supply AI semiconductors would give it a competitive advantage for the years to come, while its large sets of proprietary data from Google Search Index and YouTube enabled it to train its large language model Gemini. &quot;YouTube provides an unparalleled set of video content; it hosts an estimated 14 billion videos. Google has access to such content; but other AI developers do not,&quot; Microsoft said.

                              <span>India will lower import taxes on certain electric vehicles for companies committing to invest at least $500 million and setting up a local manufacturing facility within three years, a policy shift that could potentially bolster Tesla&#x27;s plans to enter the South Asian market. From a report: Companies must invest a minimum of $500 million in the country and will have three years to establish local manufacturing for EVs with at least 25% of components sourced domestically, according to a government press release on Friday. Firms meeting these requirements will be allowed to import 8,000 EVs a year at a reduced import duty of 15% on cars costing $35,000 and above. India currently levies a tax of 70% to 100% on imported cars depending on their value. 

The policy change is likely going to pave the way for Tesla to enter India, as the Elon Musk-led company has been in talks with the government to lower import duties on its electric cars for years. The move also aligns with India&#x27;s goal to boost the adoption of EVs and reduce its dependence on oil imports, with the country setting a target of achieving 30% electric car sales by 2030.

The test was successful for nearly all of the objectives, including payload delivery functions on Starship that will be used for Starlink deployment and in-space fuel transfers. Unfortunately the booster did not soft-land, and the Starship vehicle was destroyed during re-entry, likely due to unspecified issues with re-starting the Raptor engine and then maintaining attitude control during re-entry. You can watch Starship&#x27;s third flight test here.

1. Chart the course
Where are we going? What are we building? Who is it for? Any executive running anything has to know the answer to these questions in order to lead anyone anywhere. If you don&#x27;t have a clue where you&#x27;re going, any road can take you there, and running in circles is as good as making progress. This is not viable.
 That doesn&#x27;t mean having a five-year plan! Or even a quarterly target! We decide on what features we&#x27;re going to build for Basecamp and HEY every 6-8 weeks. That&#x27;s charting the course just in time and at a high resolution.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been pleading with antitrust authorities around the world to do something about Big Tech for years now.

But now that something finally looks to be happening, I&#x27;m suddenly concerned that it might, and that we&#x27;ll end up wishing that it didn&#x27;t.
  It&#x27;s not because I suddenly have a newfound appreciation for Apple&#x27;s or Google&#x27;s right to milk their mobile tollbooths for billions more. Au contraire. My concern is rather that the sovereign leviathans of the world, be it the EU or the US, might not exactly share as many interests with free market advocates as it appears on the surface.

       has set up a github repository - the Theatrical

The repository goes further than this, however, in that it includes similar
       sample code in a dozen languages, including C, Java, Rust, and Python.
She has recently posted a video to her YouTube

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Wired: We&#x27;ve been ableto design and 3D-print plastic phone cases and toys at home for a decade now. For almost every other consumer product made in a factory, the robots have taken over the heavy lifting. But fashion is still stuck in the 20th century. Take a typical pair of chinos. Cotton threads are woven on a large loom at a mill somewhere in Asia, then shipped to a dye house, then shipped (usually a great distance) to a garment factory somewhere else in Asia. There, the fabric is laid flat and cut into shapes, with the excess fabric being landfilled, incinerated, or (very rarely) recycled. Underpaid and exploited garment workers hand-sew those pieces of fabric into pants, which are then shipped across the ocean to a fulfillment warehouse or a store near you. This global apparel supply chain is inefficient and emissions-heavy -- an estimated 4 percent of global waste and 2 to 4 percent of greenhouse gas emissions are attributed to fashion production. Brands have to make risky predictions many months in advance about which items will sell, leading them to over order on a massive scale.
 
Now, Walmart is piloting a project with the San Francisco Bay area startup Unspun to test whether it can manufacture the retailer&#x27;s in-house brand of chinos in the US using a technology called 3D weaving. The experiment is part of a push to nearshore Walmart&#x27;s supply chain and cut down on emissions and waste associated with textile production. While still very much in the prototype phase -- the two companies are exploring how to use Unspun&#x27;s technology to supply pants to Walmart&#x27;s stores -- if successful, this project could upend the way apparel is manufactured on a huge scale. Unspun hopes to eventually deploy 3D weaving micro-factories throughout the United States, so that anyone can order custom and locally made apparel on demand.

                              <span>Refund fraud groups are exploiting lenient refund policies, resulting in significant losses for retailers like Amazon and prompting civil lawsuits and arrests. The scheme has become so pervasive that groups now market their services on Reddit, TikTok and Telegram. CNBC reports: Fraud groups are taking advantage of retailers&#x27; lenient return policies, experts told CNBC, which often include unlimited free returns and sometimes even a preference that customers keep the items. It&#x27;s ballooned into a massive problem for retailers, costing them more than $101 billion last year, according to a survey by the National Retail Federation and Appriss Retail. The figure includes multiple forms of fraud, such as sending back clothing after it&#x27;s been worn, known as &quot;wardrobing,&quot; and returning shoplifted me…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Verge: When Nintendo sued the developers of Yuzu out of existence on March 4th, it wasn&#x27;t just an attack on the leading way to play Nintendo Switch games without a Switch. It was a warning to anyone building a video game emulator. Seven developers have now stepped away from projects, are shutting them down, or have left the emulation scene entirely. Of those that remain, many are circling the wagons, getting quieter and more careful, trying not to paint targets on their backs. Four developers declined to talk to The Verge, telling me they didn&#x27;t want to draw attention. One even tried to delete answers to my questions after we&#x27;d begun, suddenly scared of attracting press.

                              <span>Two of the biggest manufacturers of locks used in commercial safes have been accused of essentially putting backdoors in at least some of their products in a new letter by Senator Ron Wyden. 404 Media: Wyden is urging the U.S. government to explicitly warn the public about the vulnerabilities, which Wyden says could be exploited by foreign adversaries to steal what U.S. businesses store in safes, such as trade secrets. The little known &quot;manufacturer&quot; or &quot;manager&quot; reset codes could let third parties -- such as spies or criminals -- bypass locks without the owner&#x27;s consent and are sometimes not disclosed to customers. Wyden&#x27;s office also found that while the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) bans such locks for sensitive and classified U.S. government use in part due to the security vulnerability reset codes pose, the government has deliberately not warned the public about the existence of these backdoors. 

The specific companies named in Wyden&#x27;s letter are China-based SECURAM and U.S.-based Sargent and Greenleaf (S&amp;G). Each produces keypad locks which are then implemented into safes by other manufacturers. The full list of locks that contain backdoor codes is unknown, but documentation available online points to multiple SECURAM products which do include them, and S&amp;G confirmed to Wyden&#x27;s office that some of its own locks also have similar codes.

                              <span>The head of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) says investigators still do not know who worked on a Boeing 737 MAX 9 door plug involved in a Jan. 5 Alaska Airlines midair emergency and that video footage was overwritten. From a report: NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said in a letter to senators that investigators sought security camera footage when the door plug was opened and closed in September but were informed the material was overwritten. &quot;The absence of those records will complicate the NTSB&#x27;s investigation moving forward,&quot; Homendy said. &quot;To date, we still do not know who performed the work to open, reinstall, and close the door plug on the accident aircraft.&quot; 

The NTSB said previously four key bolts were missing from the door plug that blew out on the plane. Last week, Homendy said she spoke to Boeing CEO David Calhoun &quot;and asked for the names of the people who performed the work. He stated he was unable to provide that information and maintained that Boeing has no records of the work being performed.&quot; Boeing said it &quot;will continue supporting this investigation in the transparent and proactive fashion we have supported all regulatory inquiries into this accident. We have worked hard to honor the rules about the release of investigative information.&quot; A Boeing official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the planemaker standard practice is to overwrite security videos after 30 days.

                              <span>France Travail, the government agency responsible for assisting the unemployed, has fallen victim to a massive data breach exposing the personal information of up to 43 million French citizens dating back two decades, the department announced on Wednesday. The incident, which has been reported to the country&#x27;s data protection watchdog (CNIL), is the latest in a series of high-profile cyber attacks targeting French government institutions and underscores the growing threat to citizens&#x27; private data. From a report: The department&#x27;s statement reveals that names, dates of birth, social security numbers, France Travail identifiers, email addresses, postal addresses, and phone numbers were exposed. Passwords and banking details aren&#x27;t affected, at least. That said, CNIL warned that the data stolen during this incident could be linked to stolen data in other breaches and used to build larger banks of information on any given individual. It&#x27;s not clear whether the database&#x27;s entire contents were stolen by attackers, but the announcement suggests that at least some of the data was extracted.

                              <span>Microsoft has eliminated egress fees for customers removing data from its Azure cloud, joining Amazon Web Services and Google in this move. The decision comes as the European Data Act&#x27;s provisions targeting lock-in terms are set to take effect in 2025. Microsoft adds: Azure already offers the first 100GB/month of egressed data for free to all customers in all Azure regions around the world. If you need to egress more than 100GB/month, please follow these steps to claim your credit. Contact Azure Support for details on how to start the data transfer-out process. Please comply with the instructions to be eligible for the credit. Azure Support will apply the credit when the data transfer process is complete and all Azure subscriptions associated to the account have been canceled. The exemption on data transfer out to the internet fees also aligns with the European Data Act and is accessible to all Azure customers globally and from any Azure region.

                              <span>theodp writes: Tech-backed nonprofit Code.org on Wednesday fired the latest salvo in its legal battle over $3 million in unpaid licensing fees for the use of Code.org&#x27;s free [for non-commercial purposes] K-12 computer science curriculum by WhiteHat Jr., the learn-to-code edtech company with a controversial past that was bought for $300M in 2020 by Byju&#x27;s, another edtech firm that received a $50M investment from Mark Zuckerberg&#x27;s venture firm that still touts its ties to Zuckerberg on its Investors page. 

In a filing in support of a motion for default judgement, Code.org founder and CEO Hadi Partovi wrote: &quot;Whitehat&#x27;s continued use of Code.org&#x27;s platform and content without payment following Code.org&#x27;s termination of the Agreement has caused, and is continuing to cause, irreparable injury to Code.org, because it undermines Code.org&#x27;s charitable and nonprofit purpose of expanding access to computer science in schools and increasing participation by young women and students from other underrepresented groups and because it jeopardizes Code.org&#x27;s status as an organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. As a Section 501(c)(3) tax exempt organization, Code.org may not use its assets to benefit for-profit entities without receiving fair compensation.&quot; 

According to the [proposed] default judgement, &quot;Code.org is awarded the principal amount sued for of $3,000,000, along with attorneys&#x27; fees, costs, and expenses in an amount to be determined following Code.org&#x27;s submission of an application, together with pre-judgment interest of $216,001.16, from May 26, 2023 to March 13, 2024, and any additional pre-judgment interest that may accrue until the date of judgment, calculated at the rate of 9% per annum pursuant to CPLR 5001 and 5004, plus any post-judgment interest at the statutory rate, for a total judgment in the amount of $[TBD].&quot;

He&#x27;s being urged on by an anthropomorphic stack of Amazon packages with wheels and arms.

                              <span>Google announced a major change to its Safe Browsing feature in Chrome today that will make the service work in real time by checking against a server-side list -- all without sharing your browsing habits with Google. From a report: Previously, Chrome downloaded a list of known sites that harbor malware, unwanted software and phishing scams once or twice per hour. Now, Chrome will move to a system that will send the URLs you are visiting to its servers and check against a rapidly updated list there. The advantage of this is that it doesn&#x27;t take up to an hour to get an updated list because, as Google notes, the average malicious site doesn&#x27;t exist for more than 10 minutes. 

The company claims that this new server-side system can catch up to 25 percent more phishing attacks than using local lists. These local lists have also grown in size, putting more of a strain on low-end machines and low-bandwidth connections. Google is rolling out this new system to desktop and iOS users now, with Android support coming later this month.

                              <span>Damage to at least three subsea cables off the west coast of Africa is disrupting internet services across the continent. From a report: The West Africa Cable System, MainOne and ACE sea cables -- arteries for telecommunications data -- were all affected on Thursday, triggering outages and connectivity issues for mobile operators and internet service providers, according to data from internet analysis firms including NetBlocks, Kentik and Cloudflare. The cause of the cable faults has not yet been determined. 

Data show a major disruption to connectivity in eight West African countries, with Ivory Coast, Liberia and Benin being the most affected, NetBlocks, an internet watchdog, said in a post on X. Ghana, Nigeria, and Cameroon are among other countries impacted. Several companies have also reported service disruptions in South Africa. &quot;This is a devastating blow to internet connectivity along the west coast of Africa, which will be operating in a degraded state for weeks to come,&quot; said Doug Madory, director of internet analysis firm Kentik. The cable faults off the Ivory Coast come less than a month after three telecommunications cables were severed in the Red Sea, highlighting the vulnerability of critical communications infrastructure.

                              <span>Outdoor Voices, an athletic apparel company, is closing all its stores on Sunday, The New York Times reported this week, citing four employees at four different stores. From the report: In an internal Slack message reviewed by The New York Times, some employees were notified on Wednesday that &quot;Outdoor Voices is embarking on a new chapter as we transition to an exclusively online business.&quot; Products in stores are going to be discounted 50 percent, according to the Slack message. The news came as a surprise, two of the employees said, adding that they were not offered severance. 

Outdoor Voices, which lists 16 retail locations on its website, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Founded in 2014 by Ty Haney, the brand became popular for its muted tones and highly Instagrammable aesthetics. Think matching crop tops and leggings in pale shades of earthy tones. Its hashtag and company mantra, #DoingThings, became popular on social media, where brand loyalists would regularly share images of themselves participating in athletic activities like running or hiking or spinning. The company often hosted events, like group exercise classes, and even built an editorial platform called The Recreationalist. Many Outdoor Voices customers weren&#x27;t just shoppers; they were devotees. The company was a chic athleisure brand perfectly positioned to attract millennials, but it was also selling a lifestyle. A lifestyle that helped the brand raise millions in funding.

                              <span>Last month, the only known surviving copy of 32-bit OS/2 from Microsoft was purchased for $650. &quot;Now, two of the internet&#x27;s experts in getting early PC operating systems running today have managed to fire it up, and you can see the results,&quot; reports The Register. From the report: Why such interest in this nearly third-of-a-century old, unreleased OS? Because this is the way the PC industry very nearly went. This SDK came out in June 1990, just one month after Windows 3.0. If 32-bit OS/2 had launched as planned, Windows 3 would have been the last version before it was absorbed into OS/2 and disappeared. There would never have been any 32-bit versions: no Windows NT, no Windows 95; no Explorer, no Start menu or taskbars. That, in turn, might well have killed off Apple as well. No iPod, no iP…</span>

                              <span>According to a new study from the Institute for the Future of Work, contemporary technology often has a negative impact on workers&#x27; quality of life. The think tank surveyed over 6,000 people to learn how four categories of workplace technologies affected their wellbeing. TechSpot reports the findings: The study found that increased exposure to three of the categories tended to worsen workers&#x27; mental state and health. The three areas that negatively impact people most are wearable and remote sensing technologies, which covers CCTV cameras and wearable trackers; robotics, consisting of automated machines, self-driving vehicles, and other equipment; and, unsurprisingly, technologies relating to AI and ML, which includes everything from decision management to biometrics. Only one of the categories was found to be beneficial to employees, and it&#x27;s one that has been around for decades: ICT tech such as laptops, tablets, phones, and real-time messaging tools.

                              <span>One of the reasons we work in six week cycles, is that it gives us a different definition of later.
When you work on really long projects — say 3, 6, 9 month projects — or projects that don’t have any end in sight, “we can do that later” typically means you’ll get to it eventually, as part of the current project. Long time frames give you invisible space to pack away unrealistic amounts of work. Since later is so far away, there’s no harm in kicking the can down the line. In other words, later makes a pile at the end.
Gnarly problem you can’t figure out how to solve yet? Punt it into the later pile. Design not coming together quite right? Toss it in the later pile. Taking on lots of technical debt as you go? Push it into the later pile.
But then as you near the end, you run into this big pile of stuff you said you’d eventually deal with, fix, redesign, tighten up, etc. But there rarely seems to be enough time at the end, so you either end up guiltily ignoring it entirely, or hastily patching it together with duct tape. And when you hastily patch, you often end up creating another fix-it-up project later.
But, when you work in six week cycles, or relatively short time frames, later means something else entirely. There’s no time for later. It’s now or not. Later doesn’t mean we’ll get to it at the end of this cycle. It means we’ll drop it. Later means another time, not this time. Later isn’t an obligation, it’s a maybe. Later isn’t a cage, it’s freedom. It’s not a debt to pay off, it’s an asset. There’s no pile of pile ups, there’s no guilt, there’s no feeling of late nights and crunch time ahead. Later simply means not now, not soon, and not for sure.
That’s the kind of later we like.

After all, if you shoot for the moon and miss, at least you&#x27;ll land with the stars. But Nvidia&#x27;s CEO Jensen Huang wants privileged Gen Z grads to lower their expectations. &quot;People with very high expectations have very low resilience -- and unfortunately, resilience matters in success,&quot; Huang said during a recent interview with the Stanford Graduate School of Business. &quot;One of my great advantages is that I have very low expectations.&quot;
 
Indeed, as the billionaire boss pointed out, those at elite institutions like Stanford probably have higher expectations for their future than your average Joe. The university is one of the most selective in the United States -- it ranks third bes…</span>

                              <span>Roman Sterlingov, the founder of a $400 million crypto-mixing service called Bitcoin Fog, has been convicted of money laundering in a United State District Court on Tuesday. Other charges include money laundering conspiracy, operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business, and violations of the D.C. Money Transmitters Act. CoinTelegraph reports: Sterlingov, however, had argued throughout the trial that he was only a user of the service, and not its operator. His attorney, Tok Ekeland said in a March 12 X post that his team will appeal the verdict. According to evidence presented at the trial, Sterlingov operated Bitcoin Fog from October 2011 to April 2021, which acted as a money laundering service for &quot;criminals seeking to hide their illicit proceeds from law enforcement.&quot;
 
The service moved over 1.2 million Bitcoin over the decade-long operation -- worth $400 million at the time of the transactions -- with the bulk of cryptocurrency coming from darknet marketplaces tied to narcotics, computer fraud abuse and identity theft, the government said. Bitcoin Fog also served distributors of child sexual abuse material. Evidence used to convict Sterlingov found that the &quot;vast majority&quot; of crypto deposited to his crypto exchange accounts came from &quot;Bitcoin clusters&quot; associated with Bitcoin Fog. &quot;Evidence presented at trial clearly showed that the defendant laundered hundreds of millions of illicit funds from the dark web through Bitcoin Fog in an attempt to conceal the origin of those funds,&quot; said Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Criminal Investigation Chief Jim Lee.

                              <span>Connor Jones reports via The Register: Stanford University says the cybersecurity incident it dealt with last year was indeed ransomware, which it failed to spot for more than four months. Keen readers of El Reg may remember the story breaking toward the end of October 2023 after Akira posted Stanford to its shame site, with the university subsequently issuing a statement simply explaining that it was investigating an incident, avoiding the dreaded R word. Well, surprise, surprise, ransomware was involved, according to a data breach notice sent out to the 27,000 people affected by the attack.
 
Akira targeted the university&#x27;s Department of Public Safety (DPS) and this week&#x27;s filing with the Office of the Maine Attorney General indicates that Stanford became aware of the incident on September 27, more than four months after the initial breach took place. According to Monday&#x27;s filing, the data breach occurred on May 12 2023 but was only discovered on September 27 of last year, raising questions about whether the attacker(s) was inside the network the entire time and why it took so long to spot the intrusion.
 
It&#x27;s not fully clear what information was compromised, but the draft letters include placeholders for three different variables. However, the filing with Maine&#x27;s AG suggests names and social security numbers are among the data types to have been stolen. All affected individuals have been offered 24 months of free credit monitoring, including access to a $1 million insurance reimbursement policy and ID theft recovery services. Akira&#x27;s post dedicated to Stanford on its leak site claims it stole 430 GB worth of data, including personal information and confidential documents. It&#x27;s all available to download via a torrent file and the fact it remains available for download suggests the research university didn&#x27;t pay whatever ransom the attackers demanded.

For those out of work, finding a new position can become a full-time job. And in tech -- a sector notoriously always looking for the next hot, new thing -- some people whose days as fresh-faced coders are long gone say that having decades of experience can feel like a disadvantage. Ageism is a longtime problem in the tech industry. Database startup RelevantDB went viral in 2021 after it posted a job listing bragging, &quot;We hire old people,&quot; which played off industry stereotypes. In 2020, the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found that IBMhad engaged in age discrimination, pushing out older workers to make room for younger ones. (T…</span>

Critics say this practice disproportionately benefits white students from wealthy backgrounds. Much of the discussion and research on legacy admissions focuses on Ivy League and other highly selective schools, but these colleges enroll only a small share of students. How widespread is the practice of legacy admissions? Is it common among public colleges?

                              <span>Epic Games, which makes the popular video game &quot;Fortnite,&quot; on Wednesday accused Apple of violating an injunction governing its lucrative App Store, and asked a U.S. judge to hold Apple in contempt and end its &quot;sham&quot; compliance. From a report: A September 2021 injunction by U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, let developers provide links and buttons that direct consumers to other means to pay for digital content. 

In a filing with the California court, Epic alleged that Apple is in &quot;blatant violation&quot; of that injunction, despite the Cupertino, California-based company&#x27;s assurance in a Jan. 16 court notice that it had &quot;fully complied.&quot; Epic said Apple has imposed new rules and a new 27% fee on developers for some purchases, which taken together make the links &quot;commercially unusable.&quot; The Cary, North Carolina-based developer also said Apple continues to &quot;categorically prohibit&quot; buttons, and still forbids some apps from telling users they have other purchasing options.

                              <span>Waymo will begin offering a robotaxi service to the public in Los Angeles this week and in Austin by the end of the year, the company&#x27;s co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said Wednesday at SXSW. From a report: The Alphabet company has been testing and validating its driverless vehicles across about 43 square miles around downtown, Barton Hills, Riverside, East Austin and Hyde Park neighborhoods. The announcement comes about a week after Waymo started letting its autonomous vehicles traverse Austin without a safety operator behind the wheel, a critical step before the company opens the program up to the public. 

Opening up a robotaxi service means the public will be able to hail a ride in a driverless car via the Waymo One app. Importantly, Waymo will be able to charge for those rides. Austin will become the fourth city where Waymo operates a commercial driverless service. Waymo also operates a robotaxi service in Phoenix, San Francisco and soon Los Angeles.

                              <span>Ethereum has successfully completed a major software upgrade that should make using the blockchain network ecosystem cheaper. The update enables transactions that previously cost $1 on linked Layer 2 networks such as Arbitrum, Polygon, and Coinbase&#x27;s Base to be executed for just a cent. 

The Dencun upgrade, a combination of the &quot;Deneb&quot; and &quot;Cancun&quot; portions of the update, introduces a new data storage system for Ethereum. Currently, most Layer 2 blockchains store data on Ethereum, and because this data is stored permanently on every Ethereum node, storage costs often account for around 90% of Layer 2 expenses. These costs are typically passed on to applications, which in turn charge consumers. With Dencun, Layer 2s can now store data in a new type of repository called blobs, which will be cheaper as the data will only be stored for approximately 18 days.

                              <span>You&#x27;ll soon get to try out OpenAI&#x27;s buzzy text-to-video generator for yourself. From a report: In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati says Sora will be available &quot;this year&quot; and that it &quot;could be a few months.&quot; OpenAI first showed off Sora, which is capable of generating hyperrealistic scenes based on a text prompt, in February. The company only made the tool available for visual artists, designers, and filmmakers to start, but that didn&#x27;t stop some Sora-generated videos from making their way onto platforms like X. 

In addition to making the tool available to the public, Murati says OpenAI has plans to &quot;eventually&quot; incorporate audio, which has the potential to make the scenes even more realistic. The company also wants to allow users to edit the content in the videos Sora produces, as AI tools don&#x27;t always create accurate images. &quot;We&#x27;re trying to figure out how to use this technology as a tool that people can edit and create with,&quot; Murati tells the Journal. When pressed on what data OpenAI used to train Sora, Murati didn&#x27;t get too specific and seemed to dodge the question.

                              <span>Will Knight, writing for Wired: Goat Simulator 3 is a surreal video game in which players take domesticated ungulates on a series of implausible adventures, sometimes involving jetpacks. That might seem an unlikely venue for the next big leap in artificial intelligence, but Google DeepMind today revealed an AI program capable of learning how to complete tasks in a number of games, including Goat Simulator 3. Most impressively, when the program encounters a game for the first time, it can reliably perform tasks by adapting what it learned from playing other games. The program is called SIMA, for Scalable Instructable Multiworld Agent, and it builds upon recent AI advances that have seen large language models produce remarkably capable chabots like ChatGPT.

                              <span>Rates of more than a dozen cancers are increasing among adults under 50 worldwide, with the number of early-onset cancer cases predicted to rise by around 30% between 2019 and 2030. Investigators are searching for explanations, considering factors such as obesity, early-cancer screening, gut microbiome, and tumor genomes. Despite increased screening and awareness, mortality from early-onset cancers has risen by nearly 28% between 1990 and 2019 globally.

                              <span>The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill on Wednesday that would give TikTok&#x27;s Chinese owner ByteDance about six months to divest the U.S. assets of the short-video app used by about 170 million Americans or face a ban. From a report: The bill passed 352-65, with bipartisan support, but it faces a more uncertain path in the Senate where some favor a different approach to regulating foreign-owned apps that could pose security concerns. Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has not indicated how he plans to proceed. 

TikTok&#x27;s fate has become a major issue in Washington. Democratic and Republican lawmakers said their offices had received large volumes of calls from teenaged TikTok users who oppose the legislation, with the volume of complaints at times exceeding the number of calls seeking a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. 

The measure is also the latest in a series of moves in Washington to respond to U.S. national security concerns about China, from connected vehicles to advanced artificial intelligence chips to cranes at U.S. ports.
The vote comes just over a week since the bill was proposed following one public hearing with little debate, and after action in Congress had stalled for more than a year. Last month, President Joe Biden&#x27;s re-election campaign joined TikTok, raising hopes among TikTok officials that legislation was unlikely this year.

                              <span>According to Bloomberg (paywalled), the Pentagon has reportedly scrapped its plan to allocate $2.5 billion in grants to Intel, causing the firm&#x27;s stock to slip in extended-hours trading. From a report: The decision now leaves the U.S. Commerce Department, which is responsible for doling out the funds from the U.S. CHIPs and Science Act, to make up the shortfall, the news outlet said. The Commerce Dept. was initially only supposed to cover $1B of the $3.5B that Intel is slated to receive for advanced defense and intelligence-related semiconductors. The deal is slated to position Intel as the dedicated supplier for processors used for military and intelligence applications and could result in a Secure Enclave inside Intel&#x27;s chip factory, the news outlet said. With the Pentagon reportedly pulling out, it could alter how much Intel and other companies receive from the CHIPs Act, the news outlet said.

Volozh, 60, was initially included on the EU sanctions list in June 2023, following Russia&#x27;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. &quot;Volozh is a leading businessperson involved in economic sectors providing a substantial source of revenue to the Government of the Russian Federation,&quot; the blocsaidlast year to justify its decision. &quot;As founder and CEO of Yandex, he is supporting, materially…</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s a double whammy of anxiety for developers at the moment. On the one hand, the layoffs are dragging on. The industry has shed more jobs in a shorter period than any time since the dot-com bust over twenty years ago. Seasoned veterans who used to have recruiters banging on their door nonstop can suddenly barely get a callback. And now the threat of AI suddenly got even more urgent and imminent with the launch of Devin.
  If you zoom out, though, developers are still flying high on tailwinds that took them to the moon over the past decade. Yes, hundreds of thousands of people have lost their jobs in the tech industry, but the preceding hiring bonanza still leaves us with an enormous and wealthy industry. And the wage gains secured during the go-go days are still massive, despite what inf…</span>

       attitudinal and behavioral metrics. We also see that qualitative metrics
       allow you to measure things that are otherwise unmeasurable, provide missing
       visibility, and supply necessary context for quantitative data.

                              <span>The essence of the book Radical Candor is the concept of ruinous empathy. That by trying your best to couch employee performance feedback in overly gentle language, you end up confusing the message, and cheating the recipient out of the clarity they desperately need to improve – or prepare for what happens if they don&#x27;t. 
  This concept extends to more than just direct employee feedback. It can also seep into other forms of communication, policies, and ultimately the entire culture. At 37signals, we&#x27;ve labeled this broader problem being &quot;overly precious&quot;.
  Let me give you an example. We used to have official &quot;mental health days&quot; for employees. With an explicit invitation that people really should just take some time off if they felt &quot;overwhelmed&quot; or &quot;mentally fatigued&quot;. Here&#x27;s the old par…</span>

                              <span>After 10 years and billions of dollars spent in development, Apple abruptly canceled its ambitious car project known as &quot;Titan,&quot; shifting its focus and resources on the company&#x27;s artificial intelligence division. In a recent Q&amp;A on Monday, Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman (paywalled) shared some new insights about the project and how involved the Apple Silicon team was before it was shut down. According to Gurman, Apple was planning to power the &quot;AI brain&quot; of the car with a custom Apple Silicon chip that would have the equivalent power of four M2 Ultra chips (the most powerful Apple has to date) combined. 9to5Mac reports: A single M2 Ultra chip consists of 134 billion transistors and features a 24-core CPU, a GPU with up to 76 cores, and a dedicated 32-core Neural Engine. M2 Ultra powers the current generation of Mac Studio and Mac Pro. Interestingly, Gurman says that the development of this new chip for the car was &quot;nearly finished&quot; before the project was discontinued. As some of the engineers working on the car project were reassigned to other teams at Apple, the company could reuse the engineering of this new chip for future projects.

                              <span>Tom Warren reports via The Verge: Discord will soon allow developers to build new games and apps that can be used directly in its chat app. A selection of minigames and apps have been available to Discord users for months now, but starting March 18th, all Discord developers will get access to a new Embedded App SDK that lets them build these special embedded apps. Discord has used its Activities feature to enable apps like YouTube, promote minigames like poker, and even encourage users to play with a shared whiteboard experience. These apps all appear as an embedded iframe inside Discord, but they&#x27;ve been limited to select developers so far.
 
The SDK will open up this Activities section of Discord to many more developers, so we&#x27;re bound to see a lot more minigames that can be played directly inside Discord chats. [...] Discord is also experimenting with a way to allow users to add apps to their accounts so they roam across servers. Developers will be able to enable their apps for accounts, and the experiment will launch alongside the app SDK on March 18th. Discord is also bringing back its app pitches, where developers can pitch prototype app ideas and secure up to $30,000 in funding.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Reuters: The New York Times has denied claims by OpenAI that it &quot;hacked&quot; the company&#x27;s artificial intelligence systems to create misleading evidence of copyright infringement, calling the accusation as &quot;irrelevant as it is false.&quot; The Times in a court filing on Monday said OpenAI was &quot;grandstanding&quot; in its request to dismiss parts of the newspaper&#x27;s lawsuit alleging its articles were misused for artificial intelligence training. The Times sued OpenAI and its largest financial backer Microsoft in December, accusing them of using millions of its articles without permission to train chatbots to provide information to users.
 
The newspaper is among several prominent copyright owners including authors, visual artists and music publishers that have sued tech companies over the alleged misuse of their work in AI training. The Times&#x27; complaint cited several instances in which programs like OpenAI&#x27;s popular chatbot ChatGPT gave users near-verbatim excerpts of its articles when prompted. OpenAI responded last month that the Times had paid an unnamed &quot;hired gun&quot; to manipulate its products into reproducing the newspaper&#x27;s content. It asked the court to dismiss parts of the case, including claims that its AI-generated content infringes the Times&#x27; copyrights. &quot;In the ordinary course, one cannot use ChatGPT to serve up Times articles at will,&quot; OpenAI said. The company also said it would eventually prove that its AI training made fair use of copyrighted content.
 
The Times replied on Monday that it had simply used the &quot;first few words or sentences&quot; of its articles to prompt ChatGPT to recreate them.
&quot;OpenAI&#x27;s true grievance is not about how The Times conducted its investigation, but instead what that investigation exposed: that Defendants built their products by copying The Times&#x27;s content on an unprecedented scale -- a fact that OpenAI does not, and cannot, dispute,&quot; the Times said.

                              <span>China is using AI in the operation of its 45,000km (28,000-mile) high-speed rail network, with the technology achieving several milestones, according to engineers involved in the project. From a report: An AI system in Beijing is processing vast amounts of real-time data from across the country and can alert maintenance teams of abnormal situations within 40 minutes, with an accuracy as high as 95 per cent, they said in a peer-reviewed paper. &quot;This helps on-site teams conduct reinspections and repairs as quickly as possible,&quot; wrote Niu Daoan, a senior engineer at the China State Railway Group&#x27;s infrastructure inspection centre, in the paper published by the academic journal China Railway. 

In the past year, none of China&#x27;s operational high-speed railway lines received a single warning that required speed reduction due to major track irregularity issues, while the number of minor track faults decreased by 80 per cent compared to the previous year. According to the paper, the amplitude of rail movement caused by strong winds also decreased -- even on massive valley-spanning bridges -- with the application of AI technology. [...] According to the paper, after years of effort Chinese railway scientists and engineers have &quot;solved challenges&quot; in comprehensive risk perception, equipment evaluation, and precise trend predictions in engineering, power supply and telecommunications. The result was &quot;scientific support for achieving proactive safety prevention and precise infrastructure maintenance for high-speed railways,&quot; the engineers said.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: If you&#x27;re confused about what makes a PC an &quot;AI PC,&quot; you&#x27;re not alone. But finally have something of an answer: if it packs a GPU, a processor that boasts a neural processing unit and can handle VNNI and Dp4a instructions, it qualifies -- at least according to Robert Hallock, Intel&#x27;s senior director of technical marketing. As luck would have it, that combo is present in Intel&#x27;s current-generation desktop processors -- 14th-gen Core, aka Core Ultra, aka &quot;Meteor Lake.&quot; All models feature a GPU, NPU, and can handle Vector Neural Network Instructions (VNNI) that speed some -- surprise! -- neural networking tasks, and the DP4a instructions that help GPUs to process video. 

Because AI PCs are therefore just PCs with current processors, Intel doesn&#x27;t consider &quot;AI PC&quot; to be a brand that denotes conformity with a spec or a particular capability not present in other PCs. Intel used the &quot;Centrino&quot; brand to distinguish Wi-Fi-enabled PCs, and did likewise by giving home entertainment PCs the &quot;Viiv&quot; moniker. Chipzilla still uses the tactic with &quot;vPro&quot; -- a brand that denotes processors that include manageability and security for business users. But AI PCs are neither a brand nor a spec. &quot;The reason we have not created a category for it like Centrino is we believe this is simply what a PC will be like in four or five years time,&quot; Hallock told The Register, adding that Intel&#x27;s recipe for an AI PC doesn&#x27;t include specific requirements for memory, storage, or I/O speeds. &quot;There are cases where a very large LLM might require 32GB of RAM,&quot; he noted. &quot;Everything else will fit comfortably in a 16GB system.&quot;

From a report: A new installment of Silicon Valley&#x27;s most exciting game, Are We in a Bubble?!, has begun. This time around the game&#x27;s premise hinges on whether AI technology is poised to change the world as the consumer internet did -- or even more dramatically -- or peter out and leave us with some advances but not a new global economy. This game isn&#x27;t easy to play, and the available data points often prove more confusing than enlightening. Take the case of Cognition AI Inc. 

You almost certainly have not heard of this startup, in part because it&#x27;s been trying to keep itself secret and in part because it didn&#x27;t even officially exist as a corporation until two months ago. And yet this very, very young…</span>

                              <span>Google is restricting AI chatbot Gemini from answering questions about the global elections set to happen this year, the Alphabet-owned firm said on Tuesday, as it looks to avoid potential missteps in the deployment of the technology. From a report: The update comes at a time when advancements in generative AI, including image and video generation, have fanned concerns of misinformation and fake news among the public, prompting governments to regulate the technology. 

When asked about elections such as the upcoming U.S. presidential match-up between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, Gemini responds with &quot;I&#x27;m still learning how to answer this question. In the meantime, try Google Search&quot;.
Google had announced restrictions within the U.S. in December, saying they would come into effect ahead of the election. &quot;In preparation for the many elections happening around the world in 2024 and out of an abundance of caution, we are restricting the types of election-related queries for which Gemini will return responses,&quot; a company spokesperson said on Tuesday.

                              <span>A six-week audit by the Federal Aviation Administration of Boeing&#x27;s production of the 737 Max jet found dozens of problems (non-paywalled link) throughout the manufacturing process at the plane maker and one of its key suppliers, according to a slide presentation reviewed by The New York Times. From the report: The air-safety regulator initiated the examination after a door panel blew off a 737 Max 9 during an Alaska Airlines flight in early January. Last week, the agency announced that the audit had found &quot;multiple instances&quot; in which Boeing and the supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, failed to comply with quality-control requirements, though it did not provide specifics about the findings. 

The presentation reviewed by The Times, though highly technical, offers a more detailed picture of what the audit turned up. Since the Alaska Airlines episode, Boeing has come under intense scrutiny over its quality-control practices, and the findings add to the body of evidence about manufacturing lapses at the company. For the portion of the examination focused on Boeing, the F.A.A. conducted 89 product audits, a type of review that looks at aspects of the production process. The plane maker passed 56 of the audits and failed 33 of them, with a total of 97 instances of alleged noncompliance, according to the presentation. 

The F.A.A. also conducted 13 product audits for the part of the inquiry that focused on Spirit AeroSystems, which makes the fuselage, or body, of the 737 Max. Six of those audits resulted in passing grades, and seven resulted in failing ones, the presentation said. At one point during the examination, the air-safety agency observed mechanics at Spirit using a hotel key card to check a door seal, according to a document that describes some of the findings. That action was &quot;not identified/documented/called-out in the production order,&quot; the document said.

From a report: The &quot;State of Subscription Apps&quot; report offers a bird&#x27;s-eye view into the subscription app universe, as RevenueCat has nearly 30,000 apps using its platform&#x27;s tools to manage their monetization. Outside of Apple and Google, that makes RevenueCat the largest collection of subscription app developers on one platform. 

This report specifically looks at data from over 29,000 apps and over 18,000 developers who collectively generate over $6.7 billion in tracked revenue and have over 290 million subscribers. After crunching its data, the company found that only 17.2% of apps will reach even $1,000 in monthly revenue, but after they hit that point, the odds of them growing further increase.

                              <span>None of the big oil and gas producers surrounding the North Sea plan to stop drilling soon enough to meet the 1.5C (2.7F) global heating target, a report has found. From a report: The five countries -- the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Denmark -- have failed to align their oil and gas policies with their climate promises under the Paris agreement, according to the campaign group Oil Change International. 

North Sea governments must act urgently, said Silje Ask Lundberg from Oil Change International, who co-wrote the report. &quot;Failure to address these issues not only undermines international climate goals, but also jeopardises the liveability of our planet.&quot; The report found that policies in Norway and the UK were furthest from the Paris climate agreement because the countries were &quot;aggressively&quot; exploring and licensing new oil and gas fields. In 2021, the International Energy Agency found there was no room for new oil exploration in its pathway to net zero emissions.

                              <span>Apple is planning to make further changes in EU countries to allow some developers to distribute their iOS apps directly from a website. From a report: The new web distribution feature will be available with a software update &quot;later this spring,&quot; according to Apple, providing developers with a key new way to distribute iOS apps in EU markets without the need for a separate app store -- as long as they&#x27;re willing to adhere to Apple&#x27;s strict rules. 

While Apple is opening up iOS to more third-party apps here, these are still some key security protections around how apps are distributed via websites -- namely, you&#x27;ll still have to work within the strict Apple app development ecosystem.

                              <span>Contributors from Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla, writing for BrowserBench: Since the initial version of the Speedometer benchmark was released in 2014 by the WebKit team, it has become a key tool for browser engines to drive performance optimizations as users and developers continue to demand richer and smoother experiences online. 

We&#x27;re proud to release Speedometer 3.0 today as a collaborative effort between the three major browser engines: Blink, Gecko, and WebKit. Like previous releases (Speedometer 2 in 2018 and Speedometer 1 in 2014), it&#x27;s designed to measure web application responsiveness by simulating user interactions on real web pages. Today&#x27;s release of Speedometer 3.0 marks a major step forward in web browser performance testing: it introduces a better way of measuring performance and a more representative set of tests that reflect the modern Web. 

This is the first time the Speedometer benchmark, or any major browser benchmark, has been developed through a cross-industry collaboration supported by each major browser engine: Blink/V8, Gecko/SpiderMonkey, and WebKit/JavaScriptCore. It&#x27;s been developed under a new governance model, driven by consensus, and is hosted in a shared repository that&#x27;s open to contribution. This new structure involves a lot of collective effort: discussions, research, debates, decisions, and hundreds of PRs since we announced the project in December 2022. 

Speedometer 3 adds many new tests. We started designing this new benchmark by identifying some key scenarios and user interactions that we felt were important for browsers to optimize. In particular, we added new tests that simulate rendering canvas and SVG charts (React Stockcharts, Chart.js, Perf Dashboard, and Observable Plot), code editing (CodeMirror), WYSIWYG editing (TipTap), and reading news sites (Next.js and Nuxt.js).

The ability to transfer your data from one place to another seamlessly without any roadblocks. These are just some of the predictions for the future of the web from the inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, on the 35th anniversary of its invention. 

[...] Another thing Berners-Lee says might happen in the future is a big tech company being forced to break up. [...] Berners-Lee said he always prefers it when tech companies &quot;do the right thing by themselves&quot; before regulators step in. &quot;That&#x27;s always been the spirit of the internet.&quot; He uses the example of the Data Transfer Initiative, a private initiative that launched in 2018 and is now backed by the likes of Google, Apple, and Meta, to encourage portability of photos, videos and other data between their platforms. 

&quot;Maybe the companies were prompted a bit by the possibility of regulation,&quot; Berners-Lee said. &quot;But this was an independent thing.&quot; However, he added: &quot;Things are changing so quickly. AI is changing very, very quickly. There are monopolies in AI. Monopolies changed pretty quickly back in the web. Maybe at some point in the future, agencies will have to work to break up big companies, but we don&#x27;t know which company that will be.&quot;

                              <span>Surgeons in the United Kingdom have performed the first operation in the country using Apple&#x27;s Vision Pro headset. TechSpot reports: During a recent operation to repair a patient&#x27;s spine at the private Cromwell Hospital in London, a scrub nurse working alongside the surgeon used the Vision Pro to help prepare, keep track of the procedure, and choose the right tools, reports the Daily Mail. This marked the first operation in the UK where the Vision Pro was used. The software running on Apple&#x27;s headset during the operation comes from US company eXeX, which has made similar programs for Microsoft&#x27;s HoloLens. It offers nurses and technicians both holographic and touch-free access to the surgical setup and the procedural guides from within the sterile field of the operating room, according to the press release. The software also tracks each stage of an operation and can measure how well the op went compared to previous procedures performed by other surgeons.
 
&quot;It eliminates human error and eliminates the guesswork,&quot; said Suvi Verho, lead scrub nurse at London Independent Hospital. &quot;It gives you confidence in surgery.&quot; While this marked the first time that the Vision Pro was used during a UK surgery, the first-ever time the device was used in an operating room was last month, just three days after its release, when Orlando resident and world-renowned Neurosurgeon Dr. Robert Masson wore it during several spine reconstruction surgeries. &quot;We are in a new era of surgery, and for the first time, our surgical teams have the brilliance of visual holographic guidance and maps, improving visuospatial and temporal orientation for each surgical team and for each surgery in all specialties,&quot; said Masson.

                              <span>Measuring developer productivity is a difficult challenge.
       Conventional metrics focused on development cycle time and throughput are
       limited, and there aren&#x27;t obvious answers for where else to turn.
       Qualitative metrics offer a powerful way to measure and understand
       developer productivity using data derived from developers themselves.
       Abi Noda and Tim Cochran begin their
       discussion by explaining what a qualitative metric is and
       why we shouldn&#x27;t reject them for being subjective or unreliable.

                              <span>Jess Weatherbed reports via The Verge: Midjourney says it has banned Stability AI staffers from using its service, accusing employees at the rival generative AI company of causing a systems outage earlier this month during an attempt to scrape Midjourney&#x27;s data. Midjourney posted an update to its Discord server on March 2nd that acknowledged an extended server outage was preventing generated images from appearing in user galleries. In a summary of a business update call on March 6th, Midjourney claimed that &quot;botnet-like activity from paid accounts&quot; -- which the company specifically links to Stability AI employees -- was behind the outage.
 
According to Midjourney user Nick St. Pierre on X, who listened to the call, Midjourney said that the service was brought down because &quot;someone at Stab…</span>

                              <span>According to Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman, AirPods Pro will gain a new &quot;hearing aid mode&quot; with the release of iOS 18 later this year. MacRumors reports: Writing in the subscriber edition of his regular Power On newsletter, Gurman claims that the &quot;big news&quot; for AirPods Pro in the near term will be support for a hearing aid-style function when iOS 18 drops in the fall. To be clear, this isn&#x27;t the first time we have heard a potential hearing aid feature for AirPods Pro. The first rumor appeared in a 2021 Wall Street Journal report, but it was previously framed as a feature that would be exclusive to a next-generation model of AirPods Pro. However, Apple in September 2022 released the second-generation AirPods Pro, while the company more recently released a refreshed model with a USB-C port.
 
AirPods Pro already offer a Conversation Boost feature, which boosts the volume and clarity of people directly in front of the wearer, but Apple has not advertised the earbuds as a hearing aid device, because this would require FDA regulatory approval. As per the FDA, a hearing aid is defined as &quot;any wearable device designed for, offered for the purpose of, or represented as aiding persons with or compensating for, impaired hearing.&quot; This definition encompasses both air-conduction and bone-conduction devices in a variety of styles (for example, behind-the-ear, in-the-canal, or body worn). [...] It is not yet clear whether Apple will need FDA clearance in order to make explicit or implicit claims about the rumored &quot;hearing aid mode,&quot; which may not even adopt this exact name. If, for example, Apple subsequently suggests that AirPods Pro are for users with certain types or severity of hearing loss/impaired hearing, or for use as an alternative to a hearing aid, then they will require FDA regulatory approval to be marketed as such.

Announcing its decision in a press release today, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) said the Commission infringed &quot;several key data protection rules when using Microsoft 365.&quot;
 &quot;The Commission did not sufficiently specify what types of personal data are to be collected and for which explicit and specified purposes when using Microsoft 365,&quot; the data supervisor, Wojciech Wiewiorowski, wrote, adding: &quot;The Commission&#x27;s infringements as data controller also relate to data processing, including transfers of personal data, carried out on …</span>

                              <span>Controversial eyeball scanning startup Worldcoin has failed to get an injunction against a temporary suspension ordered Wednesday by Spain&#x27;s data protection authority, the AEPD. TechCrunch: The authority used emergency powers contained in the European Union&#x27;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to make the local order, which can apply for up to three months. It said it was taking the precautionary measure against Worldcoin&#x27;s operator, Tools for Humanity, in light of the sensitive nature of the biometric data being collected, which could pose a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals. It also raised specific concerns about risks to minors, citing complaints received. 

Today a Madrid-based High Court declined to grant an injunction against the AEPD&#x27;s order, saying that the &quot;safeguarding of public interest&quot; must be prioritized. As we reported Friday, the crypto blockchain biometrics digital identity firm shuttered scanning in the market shortly after the AEPD order -- which gave it 72 hours to comply. Today&#x27;s court decision means Worldcoin&#x27;s services remain suspended in Spain -- for up to three months.

                              <span>Automakers, including G.M., Honda, Kia, and Hyundai, have been collecting detailed driving data from millions of Americans through internet-enabled connected-car apps. The data, which includes information on speed, hard braking, and rapid accelerations, is shared with data brokers like LexisNexis. These brokers then provide the information to insurance companies, which use it to personalize coverage and set rates, The New York Times reported Monday. While automakers and data brokers claim to have drivers&#x27; consent, the partnerships are often obscured in fine print and unclear privacy policies. The practice raises concerns about privacy and transparency, as some drivers may be unaware that their driving habits are being tracked and shared with third parties.

                              <span>Dozens of people have been injured by what officials described as a &quot;strong movement&quot; on a Chilean flight from Australia to New Zealand. From a report: In a statement on Monday, Chilean LATAM Airlines blamed the injuries on &quot;a technical event during the flight which caused a strong movement.&quot; It is just the latest in a series of safety-related incidents to feature a Boeing plane. Passengers were met by paramedics when the LATAM Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner touched down in Auckland. It was not immediately clear what caused the incident. 

About 50 people were treated at the scene, mostly for mild injuries. Twelve were taken to hospital, an ambulance spokesperson said, with one believed to be in serious condition. It is been a turbulent week for Boeing, with the US plane maker suffering a series of safety-related issues.

                              <span>The University of Texas at Austin said Monday that it would again require standardized tests for admissions (non-paywalled source), becoming the latest selective university to reinstate requirements for SAT or ACT scores that were abandoned during the pandemic. From a report: A few years ago, about 2,000 colleges across the country began to move away from requiring test scores, at least temporarily, amid concerns they helped fuel inequality. But a growing number of those schools have reversed those policies, including Brown, Yale, Dartmouth, M.I.T., Georgetown and Purdue, with several announcing the changes in recent months. 

U.T. Austin, which admits a cross-section of high-achieving Texas students under a plan designed to increase opportunity in the state, cited a slightly different reason than the other schools in returning to test requirements. Without requiring test scores, officials said, they were hampered in placing the admitted students in programs they would be most suited for and in determining which ones needed extra help. After making test scores optional the past few years, the university will now require applicants to submit either SAT or ACT scores beginning Aug. 1, with applications for fall 2025 admissions. 

In an interview, Jay Hartzell, the U.T. president, said that the decision followed an analysis of students who did not submit scores. &quot;We looked at our students and found that, in many ways, they weren&#x27;t faring as well,&quot; Dr. Hartzell said. Those against testing requirements have long said that standardized tests are unfair because many students from affluent families use tutors and coaches to bolster their scores. But recent data has raised questions about the contention. In reinstating test requirements, some universities have said that making scores optional had the unintended effect of harming prospective students from low-income families.

                              <span>The US could further tighten controls on China&#x27;s access to sophisticated semiconductor technologies, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said, signaling Washington may intensify its campaign to prevent Beijing catching up in military capabilities. From a report: &quot;We cannot allow China to have access for their military advancement to our most sophisticated technology,&quot; she told reporters in Manila on Monday. &quot;So yes, we will do whatever it takes to protect our people including expanding our controls.&quot; 

Raimondo, who is leading a trade delegation to the Philippines and Thailand, was asked if the US is planning to add new restrictions on the sale of semiconductors to China. The Biden administration is mulling fresh sanctions on several Chinese tech companies, including memory chipmaker ChangXin Memory Technologies Inc., while pushing allies to do more to curb the export of advanced tech to China, Bloomberg has reported in recent days. Washington has taken aim at China&#x27;s chip industry for years, imposing sweeping controls on the export of advanced semiconductor-making machines and sophisticated chips like those used to develop artificial intelligence. Japan and the Netherlands, the two key countries where chip-making equipment is developed, joined the US effort last year.

                              <span>Airbnb will no longer allow hosts to use indoor security cameras, regardless of where they&#x27;re placed or what they&#x27;re used for. In an update on Monday, Airbnb says the change to &quot;prioritize the privacy&quot; of renters goes into effect on April 30th. From a report: The vacation rental app previously let hosts install security cameras in &quot;common areas&quot; of listings, including hallways, living rooms, and front doors. Airbnb required hosts to disclose the presence of security cameras in their listings and make them clearly visible, and it prohibited hosts from using cameras in bedrooms and bathrooms. 

But now, hosts can&#x27;t use indoor security cameras at all. The change comes after numerous reports of guests finding hidden cameras within their rental, leading some vacation-goers to scan their rooms for cameras. Airbnb&#x27;s new policy also introduces new rules for outdoor security cameras, and will now require hosts to disclose their use and locations before guests book a listing. Hosts can&#x27;t use outdoor cams to keep tabs on indoor spaces, either, nor can they use them in &quot;certain outdoor areas where there&#x27;s a great expectation of privacy,&quot; such as an outdoor shower or sauna.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Linus Torvalds has released version 6.8 of the Linux Kernel. &quot;So it took a bit longer for the commit counts to come down this release than I tend to prefer,&quot; Torvalds wrote on the Linx kernel mailing list on Sunday, &quot;but a lot of that seemed to be about various selftest updates (networking in particular) rather than any actual real sign of problems.&quot; 

&quot;And the last two weeks have been pretty quiet, so I feel there&#x27;s no real reason to delay 6.8.&quot; So he delivered it, ending his own speculation that this cut of the kernel might need an eighth release candidate. Torvalds found time to note what he described as &quot;a bit of random git numerology&quot; as when work ended on this version of the kernel the git repository used to track it contained 9.996 million objects.&quot; 

&quot;This is the last mainline kernel to have less than ten million git objects,&quot; Torvalds wrote. &quot;Of course, there is absolutely nothing special about it apart from a nice round number. Git doesn&#x27;t care,&quot; he added. Fair enough -- especially as noted that other trees, such as linux-next, have well and truly passed ten million objects.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently took to the stage to claim that Nvidia&#x27;s GPUs are &quot;so good that even when the competitor&#x27;s chips are free, it&#x27;s not cheap enough.&quot; Huang further explained that Nvidia GPU pricing isn&#x27;t really significant in terms of an AI data center&#x27;s total cost of ownership (TCO). The impressive scale of Nvidia&#x27;s achievements in powering the booming AI industry is hard to deny; the company recently became the world&#x27;s third most valuable company thanks largely to its AI-accelerating GPUs, but Jensen&#x27;s comments are sure to be controversial as he dismisses a whole constellation of competitors, such as AMD, Intel and a range of competitors with ASICs and other types of custom AI silicon. 

Starting at 22:32 of the YouTube recording, John Shoven, Former Trione Director of SIEPR and the Charles R. Schwab Professor Emeritus of Economics, Stanford University, asks, &quot;You make completely state-of-the-art chips. Is it possible that you&#x27;ll face competition that claims to be good enough -- not as good as Nvidia -- but good enough and much cheaper? Is that a threat?&quot; Jensen Huang begins his response by unpacking his tiny violin. &quot;We have more competition than anyone on the planet,&quot; claimed the CEO. He told Shoven that even Nvidia&#x27;s customers are its competitors, in some cases. Also, Huang pointed out that Nvidia actively helps customers who are designing alternative AI processors and goes as far as revealing to them what upcoming Nvidia chips are on the roadmap.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this story from the New York Times:

Into the depleted field of journalism in America, a handful of websites have appeared in recent weeks with names suggesting a focus on news close to home: D.C. Weekly, the New York News Daily, the Chicago Chronicle and a newer sister publication, the Miami Chronicle. In fact, they are not local news organizations at all. They are Russian creations, researchers and government officials say, meant to mimic actual news organizations to push Kremlin propaganda by interspersing it among an at-times odd mix of stories about crime, politics and culture. 

While Russia has long sought ways to influence public discourse in the United States, the fake news organizations — at least five, so far — represent a technological leap in its eff…</span>

                              <span>Like the rest of the Rust community, crates.io has been growing rapidly, with download and package counts increasing 2-3x year-on-year. This growth doesn&#x27;t come without problems, and we have made some changes to download handling on crates.io to ensure we can keep providing crates for a long time to come.
The Problem
This growth has brought with it some challenges. The most significant of these is that all download requests currently go through the crates.io API, occasionally causing scaling issues. If the API is down or slow, it affects all download requests too. In fact, the number one cause of waking up our crates.io on-call team is &quot;slow downloads&quot; due to the API having performance issues.
Additionally, this setup is also problematic for users outside of North America, where download r…</span>

                              <span>The rustup team is happy to announce the release of rustup version 1.27.0.
Rustup is the recommended tool to install Rust, a programming language that is empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.
If you have a previous version of rustup installed, getting rustup 1.27.0 is as easy as stopping any programs which may be using Rustup (e.g. closing your IDE) and running:
$ rustup self update

Rustup will also automatically update itself at the end of a normal toolchain update:
$ rustup update

If you don&#x27;t have it already, you can get rustup from the appropriate page on our website.

The probe would inform the Justice Department&#x27;s review of whether Boeing complied with an earlier settlement that resolved a federal investigation following two fatal 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019. Inve…</span>

&quot;Starting in the 1950s, it would have marked a time when humanity&#x27;s influence on the planet became overwhelming.&quot;

The vote, first reported by The New York Times, is a stunning — though not unexpected — rebuke for the proposal, which has been working its way through a formal approval process for more than a decade...

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this article from Futurism:

More than two years since MIT claimed its scientists achieved a breakthrough in fusion energy, the university is claiming that new research &quot;confirms&quot; that the magnet-based design used in those tests isn&#x27;t just impressive in a lab setting, but is practical and economically viable, too. 

These findings come from a comprehensive report which features six separate [peer-reviewed] studies published in the journal IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity this month, assessing the feasibility of the superconductor magnets used by MIT scientists in their landmark test conducted in September 2021. 

&quot;Together, the papers describe the design and fabrication of the magnet and the diagnostic equipment needed to evaluate its performance,&quot; MIT announced, &quot;as well as the lessons learned from the process. 

&quot;Overall, the team found, the predictions and computer modeling were spot-on, verifying that the magnet&#x27;s unique design elements could serve as the foundation for a fusion power plant.&quot;
The successful test of the magnet, says Hitachi America Professor of Engineering Dennis Whyte, who recently stepped down as director of MIT&#x27;s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, was &quot;the most important thing, in my opinion, in the last 30 years of fusion research.&quot; Before the [2021] demonstration, the best-available superconducting magnets were powerful enough to potentially achieve fusion energy — but only at sizes and costs that could never be practical or economically viable. Then, when the tests showed the practicality of such a strong magnet at a greatly reduced size, &quot;overnight, it basically changed the cost per watt of a fusion reactor by a factor of almost 40 in one day,&quot; Whyte says. 
&quot;Now fusion has a chance,&quot; Whyte adds

But not everyone suffered:
Benefiting from the crisis were big players, like JPMorgan Chase. After acquiring First Republic&#x27;s $212.6 billion in loans and $92.4 billion in deposits for just over $10 billion in May 2023, JPMorgan saw a 67 percent year-over-year growth in profits that quarter. Overall, larger commercial banks saw inflows as customers sought safer institutions to hold their money. 
And what happened to Silicon Valley Bank? Axios reports:

That got devs thinking. As is, IRC isn&#x27;t user-friendly. It&#x27;s a kind of an arcane magic involving strange commands. Its onboarding is obtuse. And the protocol doesn&#x27;t natively support things like media sharing (screenshots are useful when troubleshooting), clickable links, or other modern &quot;niceties&quot;. And yet, IRC is a fast, established, open, and versatile protocol... It&#x27;s free and immediate (no sign-up required to use it) which makes it ideal for &#x27;when you need it&#x27; use.

You&#x27;ve just upgraded to an Apple IIgs, your first &quot;16-bit&quot; computer. To relieve the crushing boredom of your High School coursework, you and your friends embark on the computer geek equivalent of forming a heavy metal band: Making your own video game. You meet at the benches during lunch hour, and pass around crude plans scribbled on graph paper. You assign each other impressive titles like &quot;Master Programmer&quot;, &quot;Sound Designer&quot;, and &quot;Area Data Input&quot;. You swap 3.5&quot; disks like furtive secret agents, and stay up coding untl 3am. Your parents look at your owlish eyes — and your slipping grades — and ask if you&#x27;re &quot;on drugs&quot;. If that sounds familiar, this essay may prove interesting. It uses the game my friends and I started — but didn&#x27;t finish — in High School over 30 years ago, to explore the absurd programming contortions we did to make it playable on the Apple IIgs: The red-headed stepchild of the Apple II line; a machine that languished for six years without a hardware upgrade to avoid competing with the Macintosh. Thanks to the recent release of the first cycle-accurate emulator for this machine, you can actually play the game in all its screen-tearing glory. You can also explore the source code which has survived for 30 years, and been adapted to build on modern hardware thanks to Merlin32 and CiderPress II.

&quot;Nowadays, the content of the game itself is only good for an embarrassing laugh,&quot; according to the web page, &quot;but I feel that the code we hammered out shows the unique challenges of a bygone era, which should be remembered...&quot;

Exposure to leaded gasoline lowered the IQ of about half the population of the United States, a new study estimates. The peer-reviewed study, published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, focuses on people born before 1996 — the year the U.S. banned gas containing lead. 

Overall, the researchers from Florida State University and Duke University found, childhood lead exposure cost America an estimated 824 million points, or 2.6 points per person on average. Certain cohorts were more affected than others. For people born in the 1960s and the 1970s, when leaded gas consumption was skyrocketing, the IQ loss was estimated to be up to 6 points and for some, more than 7 points. Exposure to it came primarily from inhaling auto exhaust.
 

&quot;Lead is a neurotoxin, and no amount of it is safe.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this article from the Washington Post:


A much-debated theory holds that 4 billion years ago, give or take, long before the appearance of dinosaurs or even bacteria, the primordial soup contained only the possibility of life. Then a molecule called RNA took a dramatic step into the future: It made a copy of itself. Then the copy made a copy, and over the course of many millions of years, RNA begot DNA and proteins, all of which came together to form a cell, the smallest unit of life able to survive on its own. 

Now, in an important advance supporting this RNA World theory, scientists at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, Calif., have carried out a small but essential part of the story. In test tubes, they developed an RNA molecule that was able to make accurate copies of a different type of RNA. The work, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, gets them closer to the grand goal of growing an RNA molecule that makes accurate copies of itself. 
&quot;Then it would be alive,&quot; said Gerald Joyce, president of Salk and one of the authors of the new paper. &quot;So, this is the road to how life can arise in a laboratory or, in principle, anywhere in the universe....&quot; 

John Chaput, a professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of California at Irvine who did not participate in the study, called the crossing of that threshold by the Salk team &quot;monumental,&quot; adding that &quot;at first, I looked on it as a little bit jaw-dropping. ... It&#x27;s super-neat.&quot; 
The Post adds that &quot;the scenario they tested probably mimics one of the earliest stirrings of evolution.&quot; And Michael Kay, a professor of biochemistry at University of Utah, says the new paper has given the RNA World theory &quot;key evidence&quot; to show &quot;it is plausible and reasonable.&quot;

He added that the RNA copier developed at Salk will &quot;provide a valuable tool for people wanting to do directed evolution experiments.&quot;

                              <span>Legislation proposed in California &quot;aims to repeal Daylight saving time and put California permanently on Standard time,&quot; reports a San Diego news station: 

In November 2018, California voters passed Prop 7, a measure that would allow the state legislature to change Daylight saving time by either keeping it year-round or getting rid of it altogether. However, this measure also requires approval by the U.S. Congress if California were to opt for year-round Daylight Saving Time. So far, nothing has materialized. 


&quot;I am really, really passionate about this bill,&quot; said State Assembly Member Tri Ta, who added it is finally time to listen to the will of the voters. He has drafted new legislation that to do away with twice-yearly time changes. However, his bill would put the Golden State onto year-round Standard time: a move that would not require federal action. Oregon and Washington state are also considering similar moves [though Oregon&#x27;s bill appears stalled]. &quot;If my bill is passed, we do not need congressional approval,&quot; Ta told CBS 8, &quot;so that&#x27;s a win-win for everyone....&quot; 



Ta said that his bill has the support of the California Medical Association, as well as sleep experts who say Standard time syncs better with our natural clocks. &quot;So why don&#x27;t we go along with science?&quot; Ta added. &quot;That&#x27;s what I believe.&quot; One things most people seem to agree on: it&#x27;s time to stop changing our clocks, which research has shown leads to higher rates of accidents as well as increased health risks. 

&quot;While this new bill continues to work its way through Sacramento, Daylight saving time is still a go here in California,&quot; the article points out, &quot;starting 2 a.m. Sunday, when we set our clocks forward one hour.&quot; 

But USA Today adds that across the rest of the country, &quot;Most Americans — 62% — are in favor of ending the time change, according to an Economist/YouGov poll from last year.&quot;

                              <span>&quot;A 20-year-old Trojan resurfaced recently,&quot; reports Dark Reading, &quot;with new variants that target Linux and impersonate a trusted hosted domain to evade detection.&quot;


Researchers from Palo Alto Networks spotted a new Linux variant of the Bifrost (aka Bifrose) malware that uses a deceptive practice known as typosquatting to mimic a legitimate VMware domain, which allows the malware to fly under the radar. Bifrost is a remote access Trojan (RAT) that&#x27;s been active since 2004 and gathers sensitive information, such as hostname and IP address, from a compromised system. 

There has been a worrying spike in Bifrost Linux variants during the past few months: Palo Alto Networks has detected more than 100 instances of Bifrost samples, which &quot;raises concerns among security experts and organizations,&quot; researchers Anmol Murya and Siddharth Sharma wrote in the company&#x27;s newly published findings. 

Moreover, there is evidence that cyberattackers aim to expand Bifrost&#x27;s attack surface even further, using a malicious IP address associated with a Linux variant hosting an ARM version of Bifrost as well, they said... &quot;As ARM-based devices become more common, cybercriminals will likely change their tactics to include ARM-based malware, making their attacks stronger and able to reach more targets.&quot;

These lenses aren&#x27;t perfect, but they provide starting points for thinking about the complex dynamics of browsers, OSes, &quot;native&quot; platforms, and the standards-based Web platform.
There are only two-and-a-half reasons to build a browser, and they couldn&#x27;t be more different in intent and outcome, even when they look superficially similar. Learning to tell the difference is helpful for browser project managers and engineers, but also working web developers who struggle to develop theories of change for affecting browser teams.

Manufacturers will no longer use harmful &quot;forever chemicals&quot; in food packaging products in the U.S., according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 

In a statement released February 28, the agency declared that grease-proofing materials that contain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) will not be used in new food packaging sold in the U.S. These include PFAS used in fast-food wrappers, microwave popcorn bags, takeout boxes and pet food bags. The FDA&#x27;s announcement marks the completion of a voluntary phase-out of the materials by U.S. food packaging manufacturers. 

This action will eliminate the &quot;major source of dietary exposure to PFAS,&quot; Jim Jones, deputy commissioner for human foods at the FDA, said in an associated statement. Companies told the FDA that it could take up to 18 months to completely exhaust the market supply of these products following their final date of sale. However, most of the affected manufacturers phased out the products faster than they initially predicted, the agency noted... 

The FDA&#x27;s new announcement marks a &quot;huge win for the public,&quot; Graham Peaslee, a professor of physics at the University of Notre Dame who studies PFAS, told The Washington Post.

Red Hat was abandoning Linux end-user fans for enterprise customers by closing down Red Hat Linux 9 and launching the business-friendly Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Oh, and South African tech millionaire and astronaut Mark Shuttleworth [also a Debian Linux developer] launched Canonical, Ubuntu Linux&#x27;s parent company. 

&quot;Little did I — or anyone else — suspect that Canonical would become one of the world&#x27;s major Linux companies.&quot; 

Mark Shuttleworth answered questions from Slashdot reader in 2005 and again in 2012. And this year, Canonical celebrates its 20th anniversary. ZDNet reports:

But now, &quot;Brenden Sener, 13, of London, Ontario, has won two gold medals and a London Public Library award for his minuscule version of the contraption — a supposed war weapon made up of a large array of mirrors designed to focus and aim sunlight on a target, such as a ship, and cause combustion — according to a paper published in the January issue of the Canadian Science Fair Journal.&quot;




For his 2022 science project, Sener recreated the Archimedes screw, a device for raising and moving water. But he didn&#x27;t stop there. Sener found the death ray to be one of the more intriguing devices — sometimes referred to as the heat ray.

&quot;Reanalysis of seismic data now suggests Loeb may have been looking for the meteor remnants in the wrong place,&quot; writes the Washington Post:

The analysis, led by seismologist Benjamin Fernando of Johns Hopkins University, contends that sound waves purportedly from the meteor exploding in the atmosphere, and cited by Loeb as helping to locate the meteor&#x27;s debris field, were most likely from a truck driving on a road near the seismometer.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this report from the Washington Post:

The Earth just observed its warmest February, setting a monthly record for the ninth time in a row, the European Union&#x27;s Copernicus Climate Change Service announced Wednesday. 

The unrelenting and exceptional global warmth — fueled by a combination of human-caused warming and the El Niño climate pattern — has spanned both land and ocean areas since June. It has scientists worried about the planet crossing a critical climate threshold and prospects for an active Atlantic hurricane season. The month&#x27;s average global air temperature of 13.5 degrees Celsius (56.3 degrees Fahrenheit) was 0.12 degrees (0.22 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the previous warmest February in 2016. 

The warmth of the last 12-month period is unprecedented in modern records, coming in at 1.56 degrees (2.8 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than preindustrial levels... Scientists fear that tipping points, such as those that could lead to catastrophic sea level rises or the collapse of critical ocean circulations, will become more likely to be reached if the Earth&#x27;s temperature remains near or above that threshold for multiple years. 

 Axios adds:

This is significant, since these 12 months exceeded the Paris Agreement&#x27;s 1.5-degree target for a full year. However, the pact is aimed at averting multiple decades above that level, meaning the target hasn&#x27;t yet been officially breached. Europe was especially warm compared to average during February, along with central and northwest North America, much of South America, Africa and western Australia, Copernicus found. 

The Washington Post notes that in the United States, &quot;more than 200 locations in the Midwest and Northeast set records for winter warmth.&quot; 

They also quote a weather historian who posted on social media that &quot;We are witnessing something extraordinary and unprecedented. Several thousands of records pulverized all over the world in a matter of hours, with margins never seen before.&quot;

CNBC notes that Rivian&#x27;s current vehicles &quot;start at roughly $70,000 and can top $100,000,&quot; so the new cheaper R2 midsize SUV (starting at $45,000) could be more appealing.

                              <span>A recent survey found that academic organizations are failing to preserve digital material -- &quot;including science paid for with taxpayer money,&quot; reports Ars Technica, highlighting the need for improved archiving standards and responsibilities in the digital age. From the report: The work was done by Martin Eve, a developer at Crossref. That&#x27;s the organization that organizes the DOI system, which provides a permanent pointer toward digital documents, including almost every scientific publication. If updates are done properly, a DOI will always resolve to a document, even if that document gets shifted to a new URL. But it also has a way of handling documents disappearing from their expected location, as might happen if a publisher went bankrupt. There are a set of what&#x27;s called &quot;dark archives…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Android Police: Seven years ago, Google announced that it would phase out all Chrome apps on Windows, Mac, and Linux by 2018 (it would actually take until 2023). In its place would be what the company called Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), web apps that can be installed on a user&#x27;s desktop that act as if they are practically natural apps and programs. The idea grew quickly, with Chrome users having installed PWAs in record numbers by the beginning of 2022. Soon, every website will be installable on desktops through PWAs.
 
In Chrome Canary (the daily build version of Google Chrome and typically a couple of versions ahead of the stable build), websites can now be installed on desktops. As part of the latest daily build, Google has added an &quot;Install page as app&quot; option to the &quot;Save and share&quot; submenu on the desktop version (via @Leopeva64 on X). This makes clicking the app -- which is just the website made to look and feel like a native app -- always open in its own window. Sites that already have their own PWAs, like YouTube or Reddit, have been prompting users to install them for a while now and will have their &quot;Install page as app&quot; function actually showing the name of the site. For example, YouTube&#x27;s entry will show as &quot;Install YouTube.&quot; In February, it became possible to enable the flags necessary to make any website into a PWA, but it seems to have just now become fully implemented.

                              <span>Longtime Slashdot reader AmiMoJo shares a report from The Guardian: Akira Toriyama, the influential Japanese manga artist who created the Dragon Ball series, has died at the age of 68. He died on March 1 from an acute subdural haematoma. The news was confirmed by Bird Studio, the manga company that Toriyama founded in 1983.
 
&quot;It&#x27;s our deep regret that he still had several works in the middle of creation with great enthusiasm,&quot; the studio wrote in a statement. &quot;Also, he would have many more things to achieve.&quot; The studio remembered his &quot;unique world of creation&quot;. &quot;He has left many manga titles and works of art to this world,&quot; the statement read. &quot;Thanks to the support of so many people around the world, he has been able to continue his creative activities for over 45 years.&quot; [...]
 
Based on an earlier work titled Dragon Boy, Dragon Ball was serialized in 519 chapters in Weekly Shonen Jump from 1984 to 1995 and birthed a blockbuster franchise including an English-language comic book series, five distinct television adaptation -- with Dragon Ball Z the most familiar to western audiences -- and spin-offs, over 20 different films and a vast array of video games. The series -- a kung fu take on the shonen (or young adult) manga genre -- drew from Chinese and Hong Kong action films as well as Japanese folklore. It introduced audiences to the now-instantly familiar Son Goku -- a young martial arts trainee searching for seven magical orbs that will summon a mystical dragon -- as well as his ragtag gang of allies and enemies. You can learn more about Toriyama via the Dragon Ball Wiki.
 
The Associated Press, Washington Post, and New York Times, among others, have all reported on his passing.

                              <span>Space.com describes it as &quot;a nearly 3-ton leftover tossed overboard from the International Space Station&quot; — which crashed back to earth today. One satellite tracker claims to have filmed it passing over the Netherlands... 



&quot;A couple minutes later reentry and it would have reached Fort Meyers&quot; in Florida, posted astronomer Jonathan McDowell of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. But instead it re-entered the earth&#x27;s atmosphere &quot;over the Gulf of Mexico between Cancun and Cuba,&quot; Friday afternoon. &quot;This was within the previous prediction window but a little to the northeast of the &#x27;most likely&#x27; part of the path.&quot; 

From Space.com:


The multi-ton Exposed Pallet 9 (EP9) was jettisoned from the space station back in March 2021. At the time, it was reported to be the most massive object ever tossed overboard from the International Space Station. Disposing of used or unnecessary equipment in such a way is common practice aboard the space station, as the objects typically burn up harmlessly in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. 
Ahead of EP9&#x27;s reentry, the Federal Office for Civil Protection and Disaster Relief, National Warning Center 1 in Bonn, Germany issued this information... &quot;The object is battery packs from the International Space Station. Luminous phenomena or the perception of a sonic boom are possible....&quot; EP9 is loaded with old Nickel-Hydrogen batteries, NASA explained at the time it was jettisoned, also explaining that EP9 has the approximate mass of a large SUV and predicting it would re-enter Earth&#x27;s atmosphere in two-to-four years.
 
&quot;A large space object reenters the atmosphere in a natural way approximately once per week,&quot; the European Space Agency points out, &quot;with the majority of the associated fragments burning up before reaching the ground. 
&quot;Most spacecraft, launch vehicles and operational hardware are designed to limit the risks associated with a reentry.&quot;

                              <span>Google&#x27;s swanky new office building located on the Alphabet&#x27;s Mountain View, California headquarters has been &quot;plagued for months by inoperable, or, at best, spotty Wi-Fi,&quot; reports Reuters citing six people familiar with the matter. &quot;Its recliner-laden collaborative workspaces do not work well for teams carting around laptops, since workers must plug into ethernet cables at their desks to get consistent internet service. Some make do by using their phones as hotspots.&quot; From the report: The company promoted the new building and surrounding campus in a 229-page glossy book highlighting its cutting-edge features, such as &quot;Googley interiors&quot; and &quot;an environment where everyone has the tools they need to be successful.&quot;
 
But, a Google spokeswoman acknowledged, &quot;we&#x27;ve had Wi-Fi connectivity issues in Bay View.&quot; She said Google &quot;made several improvements to address the issue,&quot; and the company hoped to have a fix in coming weeks. According to one AI engineer assigned to the building, which also houses members of the advertising team, the wonky Wi-Fi has been no help for Google pushing a three day per week return-to-office mandate. &quot;You&#x27;d think the world&#x27;s leading internet company would have worked this out,&quot; he said.
 
Managers have encouraged workers to stroll outside or sit at the adjoining cafe where the Wi-Fi signal is stronger. Some were issued new laptops recently with more powerful Wi-Fi chips. Google has not publicly disclosed the reasons for the Wi-Fi problems, but workers say the 600,000-square-foot building&#x27;s swooping, wave-like rooftop swallows broadband like the Bermuda Triangle.

                              <span>Michael McWhertor reports via Polygon: Warner Bros. Discovery is telling developers it plans to start &quot;retiring&quot; games published by its Adult Swim Games label, game makers who worked with the publisher tell Polygon. At least three games are under threat of being removed from Steam and other digital stores, with the fate of other games published by Adult Swim unclear. The media conglomerate&#x27;s planned removal of those games echoes cuts from its film and television business; Warner Bros. Discovery infamously scrapped plans to release nearly complete movies Batgirl and Coyote vs. Acme, and removed multiple series from its streaming services. If Warner Bros. does go through with plans to delist Adult Swim&#x27;s games from Steam and digital console stores, 18 or more games could be affected.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from MobileSyrup: Google&#x27;s new smart assistant, Gemini, is available on multiple devices but Gemini Nano, the multimodal large language model, isn&#x27;t coming to all Pixel smartphones. Gemini Nano is only available on the Google Pixel 8 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S24 series; however, we&#x27;ve recently learned that it&#x27;s not making its way to the base Pixel 8, according to Terence Zhang, an engineer at Google and reporter by Mishaal Rahman.
 
Zhang told everyone that Gemini Nano isn&#x27;t coming to the Pixel 8 because of hardware limitations, but it&#x27;s unclear what the hardware limitations are. Many would assume it&#x27;s due to the Pixel 8 housing only 8GB of RAM compared to the Pixel 8 Pro&#x27;s 12GB. That said, the Galaxy S24 series starts at 8GB of RAM and can use Nano. This must mean that some other hardware limitations are holding back Gemini Nano. Hopefully, more information will come in the future, but right now, it seems like only high-end devices will get the Gemini Nano experience.

                              <span>The Gemini AI roll out should have been Google&#x27;s day of triumph. The company made one of the smartest acquisitions in tech when they bought DeepMind in 2014. They helped set the course for the modern AI movement with the Transformer paper in 2017. They were poised to be right there, right at the fore font of a whole new era of computing. And then they blew it.
  If it wasn&#x27;t all so terribly dark and sad, it would actually be funny. Rendering George Washington as a Black man. Equivocating on whether Musk&#x27;s memes are worse or not than actual, literal Hitler. Oh, and defending pedophilia. Yeah, the Gemini launch had it all. Like a risqué stand-up comic shocking her audience for effect. Except, Gemini wasn&#x27;t joking.

                              <span>As reported by The Information (paywalled), OpenAI CEO Sam Altman will return to the company&#x27;s board along with three new directors. Reuters reports: The company has also concluded the investigation around Altman&#x27;s November firing, the Information said, referring to the ouster that briefly threw the world&#x27;s most prominent artificial intelligence company into chaos. Employees, investors and OpenAI&#x27;s biggest financial backer, Microsoft had expressed shock over Altman&#x27;s ouster, which was reversed within days. The company will also announce the appointment of three new directors, Sue Desmond-Hellmann, a former CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Nicole Seligman, a former president of Sony Entertainment, and Fidji Simo, CEO of Instacart, the Information said. &quot;I&#x27;m pleased this whole thing is over,&quot; Altman said.
 
&quot;We are excited and unanimous in our support for Sam and Greg [Brockman],&quot; OpenAI chair and former Salesforce executive Bret Taylor told reporters. Taylor said they also adopted &quot;a number of governance enhancements,&quot; such as a whistleblower hotline and a new mission and strategy committee on the board. &quot;The mission has not changed, because it is more important than ever before,&quot; added Taylor.
 
An independent investigation by the law firm WilmerHale determined that &quot;the prior Board acted within its broad discretion to terminate Mr. Altman, but also found that his conduct did not mandate removal.&quot; The summary, provided by OpenAI, continued: &quot;The prior Board believed at the time that its actions would mitigate internal management challenges and did not anticipate that its actions would destabilize the Company. The prior Board&#x27;s decision did not arise out of concerns regarding product safety or security, the pace of development, OpenAI&#x27;s finances, or its statements to investors, customers, or business partners. Instead, it was a consequence of a breakdown in the relationship and loss of trust between the prior Board and Mr. Altman.&quot;

These include two in January and, crucially, a new DMCA filed this week against Chase Wackerfuss, the coder of a repository called âoeReactle,â which cloned Wordle in React JS (JavaScript). The most recent takedown request is critical because it not only goes after Reactle but anyone who has forked Reactle to create a different spinoff game; an archive of …</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: AMD announced this week that it has ceased FreeSync certification for monitors or TVs whose maximum refresh rates are under 144 Hz. Previously, FreeSync monitors and TVs could have refresh rates as low as 60 Hz, allowing for screens with lower price tags and ones not targeted at serious gaming to carry the variable refresh-rate technology. AMD also boosted the refresh-rate requirements for its higher AdaptiveSync tiers, FreeSync Premium and FreeSync Premium Pro, from 120 Hz to 200 Hz.
 
Here are the new minimum refresh-rate requirements for FreeSync, which haven&#x27;t changed for laptops. AMD will continue supporting already-certified FreeSync displays even if they don&#x27;t meet the above requirements. Interestingly, AMD&#x27;s minimum refresh-rate requirements for TVs goes beyond 120 Hz, which many premium TVs max out at currently, due to the current-generation Xbox and PlayStation supporting max refresh rates of 120 frames per second (FPS). Announcing the changes this week in a blog post, Oguzhan Andic, AMD FreeSync and Radeon product marketing manager, claimed that the changes were necessary, noting that 60 Hz is no longer &quot;considered great for gaming.&quot; Andic wrote that the majority of gaming monitors are 144 Hz or higher, compared to in 2015, when FreeSync debuted, and even 120 Hz was &quot;a rarity.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Dario Amodei, chief executive of the high-profile A.I. start-up Anthropic, told Congress last year that new A.I. technology could soon help unskilled but malevolent people create large-scale biological attacks, such as the release of viruses or toxic substances that cause widespread disease and death. Senators from both parties were alarmed, while A.I. researchers in industry and academia debated how serious the threat might be. Now, over 90 biologists and other scientists who specialize in A.I. technologies used to design new proteins -- the microscopic mechanisms that drive all creations in biology -- have signed an agreement that seeks to ensure that their A.I.-aided research will move forward without exposing the world to serious harm. 

The biologists, who include the Nobel laureate Frances Arnold and represent labs in the United States and other countries, also argued that the latest technologies would have far more benefits than negatives, including new vaccines and medicines. &quot;As scientists engaged in this work, we believe the benefits of current A.I. technologies for protein design far outweigh the potential for harm, and we would like to ensure our research remains beneficial for all going forward,&quot; the agreement reads. The agreement does not seek to suppress the development or distribution of A.I. technologies. Instead, the biologists aim to regulate the use of equipment needed to manufacture new genetic material. This DNA manufacturing equipment is ultimately what allows for the development of bioweapons, said David Baker, the director of the Institute for Protein Design at the University of Washington, who helped shepherd the agreement.

                              <span>Astronomers have observed a distant planet that could be entirely covered in a deep water ocean, in findings that advance the search for habitable conditions beyond Earth. From a report: The observations, by Nasa&#x27;s James Webb space telescope (JWST), revealed water vapour and chemical signatures of methane and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of the exoplanet, which is twice Earth&#x27;s radius and about 70 light years away. This chemical mix is consistent with a water world where the ocean would span the entire surface, and a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, according to researchers from the University of Cambridge, although they do not envisage a balmy, inviting seascape. &quot;The ocean could be upwards of 100 degrees [Celsius] or more,&quot; said Prof Nikku Madhusudhan, who led the analysis. At high atmospheric pressure, an ocean this hot could still be liquid, &quot;but it&#x27;s not clear if it would be habitable,&quot; he added. 

This interpretation is favoured in a paper published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics Letters, but is disputed by a Canadian team that made additional observations of the same exoplanet, which is known as TOI-270 d. They detected the same atmospheric chemicals but argue the planet would be too hot for liquid water -- possibly 4,000C -- and instead would feature a rocky surface topped by an incredibly dense atmosphere of hydrogen and water vapour. Whichever view wins out, these latest observations showcase the stunning insights James Webb is giving into the nature of planets beyond our solar system. The telescope captures the starlight that has been filtered through the atmospheres of orbiting planets to give detailed breakdowns of the chemical elements present. From this, astronomers can build up a picture of conditions at a planet&#x27;s surface -- and the likelihood of life being able to survive there.

                              <span>Microsoft has abruptly pulled a feature from OneDrive that allows users to upload files to the cloud storage service directly from a URL. From a report: The feature turned up as a preview in 2021 and was intended for scenarios &quot;where the file contents aren&#x27;t available, or are expensive to transfer,&quot; according to Microsoft. It was particularly useful for mobile users, for whom uploading files directly through their apps could be costly. Much better to simply point OneDrive at a given URL and let it handle the upload itself. 

However, the experimental feature never made it past the consumer version of OneDrive. It also didn&#x27;t fit with Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;vision for OneDrive as a cloud storage service that syncs your files across devices.&quot; Indeed, the idea of hosing data into OneDrive from a remote source sits at odds with the file synchronization model being championed by Microsoft and conveniently available from macOS and Windows.

Epic CEO Tim Sweeney adds: The DMA went through its first major challenge with Apple banning Epic Games Sweden from competing with the App Store, and the DMA just had its first major victory. Following a swift inquiry by the European Commission, Apple notified the Commission and Epic that it would relent and restore our access to bring back Fortnite and launch Epic Games Store in Europe under the DMA law.

                              <span>A United Airlines Holdings aircraft ran off the taxiway into a grassy area after landing at Houston Friday, the third incident this week involving the airline&#x27;s Boeing planes. From a report: United Flight 2477, with 160 passengers and six crew, had just landed at George Bush Intercontinental Airport about 8 a.m. local time Friday when it veered into the grass on a turn. No one was injured, and passengers left the plane on a set of stairs before being bused to the terminal, the airline said. 

The incident follows the mid-air loss of a tire from a United Boeing 777-200 Thursday, just after the plane took off from San Francisco on a flight to Osaka, Japan, and an engine fire on a United flight from Houston to Fort Myers, Florida, earlier this week. The plane in the Houston-to-Florida flight had to make an emergency landing after one of its engines burst into flames 10 minutes after takeoff. The 21-year-old aircraft was also a 737 -- but an earlier version than the Max, according to FlightRadar24.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: In the 1960s, secret test flights of advanced government spy planes generated U.F.O. sightings. More recently, government and commercial drones, new kinds of satellites and errant weather balloons have led to a renaissance in unusual observations. But, according to a new report, none of these sightings were of alien spacecraft. The new congressionally mandated Pentagon report found no evidence that the government was covering up knowledge of extraterrestrial technology and said there was no evidence that any U.F.O. sightings represented alien visitation to Earth. 

The 63-page document is the most sweeping rebuttal the Pentagon has issued in recent years to counter claims that it has information on extraterrestrial visits or technology. But amid widespread distrust of the government, the report is unlikely to calm a growing obsession with aliens. Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder, a Defense Department spokesman, said the Pentagon approached the report with an open mind and no preconceived notions, but simply found no evidence to back up claims of secret programs, hidden alien technology or anything else extraterrestrial. The new report suggests that the public&#x27;s belief that the government is hiding what it knows will probably continue. The report adds: Nevertheless the public is unlikely to be swayed. Many people dismiss the government&#x27;s claims that nothing interesting is going on in Pentagon videos that appear to show strange objects, citing accounts by Navy pilots that they observed objects whose movements cannot be easily explained. The new report notes that in the past, particularly in the 1950s, there was interest in U.F.O.s, but today the attention on unexplained sightings is greater than ever before. Politico adds: The Pentagon has disclosed that the government once considered a program to recover and reverse-engineer any captured alien spacecraft, an effort that never came to fruition but fueled conspiracy theories about a cover-up.

                              <span>Astra Space, a California-based rocket company, has announced it will go private at a valuation significantly lower than its $2.1 billion debut in 2021. The company&#x27;s market value is about $13 million at current levels. The company&#x27;s co-founders, Chris Kemp and Adam London, will acquire all outstanding shares at $0.50 each, well below the current trading price of $0.80. Astra has faced challenges, with only two successful launches out of seven attempts of its Rocket 3 vehicle. The company pivoted to the larger Rocket 4 in 2022 but has yet to conduct test launches. 

Astra faces competition from established players like Rocket Lab and Firefly, as well as new entrants such as ABL Space and Stoke Space. The company&#x27;s future remains uncertain as it navigates a competitive small launch market, with SpaceX&#x27;s Transporter missions offering lower prices by launching dozens of satellites simultaneously on its Falcon 9 booster.

                              <span>Microsoft revealed earlier this year that Russian state-sponsored hackers had been spying on the email accounts of some members of its senior leadership team. Now, Microsoft is disclosing that the attack, from the same group behind the SolarWinds attack, has also led to some source code being stolen in what Microsoft describes as an ongoing attack. From a report: &quot;In recent weeks, we have seen evidence that Midnight Blizzard [Nobelium] is using information initially exfiltrated from our corporate email systems to gain, or attempt to gain, unauthorized access,&quot; explains Microsoft in a blog post. &quot;This has included access to some of the company&#x27;s source code repositories and internal systems. To date we have found no evidence that Microsoft-hosted customer-facing systems have been compromised.&quot; 

It&#x27;s not clear what source code was accessed, but Microsoft warns that the Nobelium group, or &quot;Midnight Blizzard,&quot; as Microsoft refers to them, is now attempting to use &quot;secrets of different types it has found&quot; to try to further breach the software giant and potentially its customers. &quot;Some of these secrets were shared between customers and Microsoft in email, and as we discover them in our exfiltrated email, we have been and are reaching out to these customers to assist them in taking mitigating measures,&quot; says Microsoft.

                              <span>President Biden included a nod to a rising issue in the entertainment and tech industries during his State of the Union address Thursday evening, calling for a ban on AI voice impersonations. From a report: &quot;Here at home, I have signed over 400 bipartisan bills. There&#x27;s more to pass my unity agenda,&quot; President Biden said, beginning to list off a series of different proposals that he hopes to address if elected to a second term. &quot;Strengthen penalties on fentanyl trafficking, pass bipartisan privacy legislation to protect our children online, harness the promise of AI to protect us from peril, ban AI voice impersonations and more.&quot; 

The president did not elaborate on the types of guardrails or penalties that he would plan to institute around the rising technology, or if it would extend to the entertainment industry. AI was a peak concern for SAG-AFTRA during the actors union&#x27;s negotiations with and strike against the major studios last year.

                              <span>Michael Larabel writes via Phoronix: Fedora Workstation has long defaulted to using GNOME&#x27;s Wayland session by default, but it has continued to install the GNOME X.Org session for fallback purposes or those opting to use it instead. But for the Fedora Workstation 41 release later in the year, there is a newly-approved plan to no longer have that GNOME X.Org session installed by default. Recently there was a Fedora Workstation ticket opened to no longer install the GNOME X.Org session by default. This is just about whether the X.Org session is pre-installed but would continue to live in the repository for those wanting to explicitly install it.
 
The Fedora Workstation working group decided to go ahead with this change for the Fedora 41 cycle, not the upcoming Fedora 40 release. So pending any obstacles by FESCo, which is unlikely. Fedora Workstation 41 will not be installing the GNOME X.Org session by default. Long live Wayland.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Week Magazine: The advancement of new technologies appears to have given rise to a new problem across the United States: a crippling power shortage on the horizon. The advent of these technologies, such as eco-friendly factories and data centers, has renewed concerns that America could run out of electrical power. These worries also come at a time when the United States&#x27; aging power grid is in desperate need of repair. Heavily publicized incidents such as the 2021 Texas power outage, which was partially blamed on crypto-farming, exposed how vulnerable the nation&#x27;s power supply is, especially during emergencies. There have also been warnings from tech moguls such as Elon Musk, who has stated that the United States is primed to run out of electric…</span>

The Verge reports: Shortly after the EU&#x27;s Digital Markets Act (DMA) went into effect on Wednesday, users noticed an Apple support page stating users would &quot;lose access to some features&quot; when leaving the EU &quot;for short-term travel.&quot; But now, Apple has made this policy more specific by carving out a 30-day grace period, which could be inconvenient for frequent travelers. This doesn&#x27;t change your ability to use alternative app marketplaces, however, as Apple says you can still use third-party stores to manage apps you&#x27;ve already installed.

                              <span>Researchers have developed a way to circumvent safety measures built into large language models (LLMs) using ASCII Art, a graphic design technique that involves arranging characters like letters, numbers, and punctuation marks to form recognizable patterns or images. Tom&#x27;s Hardware reports: According to the research paper ArtPrompt: ASCII Art-based Jailbreak Attacks against Aligned LLMs, chatbots such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, and Llama2 can be induced to respond to queries they are designed to reject using ASCII art prompts generated by their ArtPrompt tool. It is a simple and effective attack, and the paper provides examples of the ArtPrompt-induced chatbots advising on how to build bombs and make counterfeit money. [...]
 
To best understand ArtPrompt and how it works, it is probably simplest to check out the two examples provided by the research team behind the tool. In Figure 1 [here], you can see that ArtPrompt easily sidesteps the protections of contemporary LLMs. The tool replaces the &#x27;safety word&#x27; with an ASCII art representation of the word to form a new prompt. The LLM recognizes the ArtPrompt prompt output but sees no issue in responding, as the prompt doesn&#x27;t trigger any ethical or safety safeguards.
 
Another example provided [here] shows us how to successfully query an LLM about counterfeiting cash. Tricking a chatbot this way seems so basic, but the ArtPrompt developers assert how their tool fools today&#x27;s LLMs &quot;effectively and efficiently.&quot; Moreover, they claim it &quot;outperforms all [other] attacks on average&quot; and remains a practical, viable attack for multimodal language models for now.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from BleepingComputer: FBI&#x27;s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) has released its 2023 Internet Crime Report (PDF), which recorded a 22% increase in reported losses compared to 2022, amounting to a record of $12.5 billion. The number of relevant complaints submitted to the FBI in 2023 reached 880,000, 10% higher than the previous year, with the age group topping the report being people over 60, which shows how vulnerable older adults are to cybercrime. Both figures continue a worrying trend seen by the agency since 2019, where complaints and losses rise yearly. For 2023, the types of crimes that increased were tech support scams and extortion, whereas phishing, personal data breach, and non-payment/non-delivery scams slightly waned.

                              <span>The European Union has confirmed it&#x27;s looking into Apple&#x27;s decision to close Epic Games&#x27; developer account -- citing three separate regulations that may apply. From a report: Yesterday the Fortnite maker revealed Apple had terminated the account, apparently reversing a decision to approve the developer account last month. Epic had planned to launch its own app store, the Epic Games Stores, on iOS in Europe, as well as Fortnight on Apple&#x27;s platform. And it accused Apple of breaching the bloc&#x27;s Digital Markets Act (DMA) by killing its developer account. 

Responding to the development, a European Commission spokesperson told TechCrunch it has &quot;requested further explanations on this from Apple under the DMA.&quot; The pan-EU regulation applies on Apple from midnight Brussels&#x27; time today. The spokesperson also said the EU is evaluating whether Apple&#x27;s actions raise compliance &quot;doubts&quot; with regard to two other regulations -- the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the platform-to-business regulation (P2B) -- given what they described as &quot;the links between the developer program membership and the App Store as designated VLOP&quot; (very large online platform).

                              <span>A directive known as Document 79 ramps up Beijing&#x27;s effort to replace U.S. tech with homegrown alternatives. From a report: For American tech companies in China, the writing is on the wall. It&#x27;s also on paper, in Document 79. The 2022 Chinese government directive expands a drive that is muscling U.S. technology out of the country -- an effort some refer to as &quot;Delete A,&quot; for Delete America. Document 79 was so sensitive that high-ranking officials and executives were only shown the order and weren&#x27;t allowed to make copies, people familiar with the matter said. It requires state-owned companies in finance, energy and other sectors to replace foreign software in their IT systems by 2027. 

American tech giants had long thrived in China as they hot-wired the country&#x27;s meteoric industrial rise with computers, operating systems and software. Chinese leaders want to sever that relationship, driven by a push for self-sufficiency and concerns over the country&#x27;s long-term security. The first targets were hardware makers. Dell, International Business Machines and Cisco Systems have gradually seen much of their equipment replaced by products from Chinese competitors. 

Document 79, named for the numbering on the paper, targets companies that provide the software -- enabling daily business operations from basic office tools to supply-chain management. The likes of Microsoft and Oracle are losing ground in the field, one of the last bastions of foreign tech profitability in the country. The effort is just one salvo in a yearslong push by Chinese leader Xi Jinping for self-sufficiency in everything from critical technology such as semiconductors and fighter jets to the production of grain and oilseeds. The broader strategy is to make China less dependent on the West for food, raw materials and energy, and instead focus on domestic supply chains.

                              <span>Samsung&#x27;s 2024 OLED TV lineup will feature both QD-OLED and WOLED panels, making it harder for consumers to distinguish between the two technologies. The company announced three new series without specifying the panel types, but reports suggest that even within the S90D series, both QD-OLED and WOLED may be used. Samsung&#x27;s decision to use both panel types is attributed to LG Display&#x27;s request not to position WOLED as inferior to QD-OLED.

                              <span>The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) will start providing more hands-on support to open-source software developers as they work to better secure their projects, the agency said. From a report: CISA hosted a two-day, invite-only summit this week with leaders in the open-source software community and other federal officials. During the private event, the agency also ran what&#x27;s likely the first tabletop exercise to assess how well the government and the open-source community would respond to a cyberattack targeting one of their projects. 

During the summit, CISA and a handful of package repositories unveiled new initiatives to help secure open-source projects. CISA is working on a new communication channel where open-source software developers can share threat intelligence and ask the agency for assistance during an incident. The Rust Foundation is developing new public key infrastructure for its repository, which will help ensure that the code developers are uploading isn&#x27;t malicious and is coming from legitimate users. 

npm, which manages the JavaScript programming language, is requiring project maintainers to enroll in multi-factor authentication and is rolling out a tool to generate &quot;software bills of materials,&quot; which provide a recipe list of what code and other elements are in a project. Additional repositories -- including the Python Software Foundation, Packagist, Composer and Maven Central -- are pursuing similar projects and also also rolling out tools to help detect and report malware and other security vulnerabilities.

                              <span>Apple is preparing to allow EU-based iPhone users to uninstall its first-party Safari browser by the end of 2024 and is working on a more &quot;user-friendly&quot; way of transferring data &quot;from an iPhone to a non-Apple phone&quot; by fall 2025. From a report: That&#x27;s according to a new compliance document published by the company, which outlines all the ways it&#x27;s complying with the European Union&#x27;s new Digital Markets Act that comes into force this week. 

Other user-facing initiatives detailed in Apple&#x27;s document include a &quot;browser switching solution&quot; to transfer data between browsers on the same device, which it plans to make available by late 2024 or early 2025. It&#x27;ll also be possible to change the default navigation app on iOS by March 2025 in the EU. The document doesn&#x27;t explicitly state whether any of these features will be available globally or whether they&#x27;ll be exclusive to users in the EU. But many of the company&#x27;s previously announced plans to comply with the DMA -- including the ability to run browser engines other than WebKit and install third-party app stores -- are only available in the bloc.

                              <span>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday approved a rule that will require some public companies to report their greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks, after last-minute revisions that weakened the directive in the face of strong pushback from companies. From a report: The rule was one of the most anticipated in recent years from the nation&#x27;s top financial regulator, drawing more than 24,000 comments from companies, auditors, legislators and trade groups over a two-year process. It brings the U.S. closer to the European Union and California, which moved ahead earlier with corporate climate disclosure rules. 

The SEC rule passed 3-2, with three Democratic commissioners supporting it and two Republicans opposed. Since the SEC proposed a rule two years ago, experts had said it was likely to face litigation almost immediately. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, one of the Democrats, acknowledged that was a factor the agency considered as it worked toward a final rule. &quot;We&#x27;ve seriously considered what people have said about our legal authorities,&quot; Gensler said on Wednesday.

                              <span>EA CEO Andrew Wilson believes generative AI will &quot;revolutionize&quot; the gaming industry over the next five years. He predicts that the technology will allow for more efficient content creation, reducing development time from months to days. From a report: Greater efficiency coupled with &quot;deeper, more immersive experiences&quot; will lead to significant audience expansion over the next few years and provide a &quot;multi-billion dollar&quot; growth opportunity, he said. Wilson said that in the past it might take six months to build an in-game sports stadium. Over the last 12 months, that time has shrunk to six weeks, and over the coming years it could maybe be cut to six days. 

And while FIFA 23 has 12 run cycles for how the players move in the game, EA Sports FC 24 has 1,200 created with generative AI. Over the next five years, Wilson hopes that generative AI will make EA&#x27;s development 30% more efficient, help grow its 700 million-strong player base by &quot;at least&quot; 50%, and lead to players spending 10-20% more money on its games. &quot;What we&#x27;ve seen every time there&#x27;s been a meaningful technological advancement in media and in technology, where you are able to democratise an industry and hand it over to the population at large, incredible things happen,&quot; he said.

                              <span>The 46-year-old probe, which flew by Jupiter and Saturn in its youth and inspired earthlings with images of the planet as a &quot;Pale Blue Dot,&quot; hasn&#x27;t sent usable data from interstellar space in months. From a report: When Voyager 1 launched in 1977, scientists hoped it could do what it was built to do and take up-close images of Jupiter and Saturn. It did that -- and much more. Voyager 1 discovered active volcanoes, moons and planetary rings, proving along the way that Earth and all of humanity could be squished into a single pixel in a photograph, a &quot;pale blue dot,&quot; as the astronomer Carl Sagan called it. It stretched a four-year mission into the present day, embarking on the deepest journey ever into space. Now, it may have bid its final farewell to that faraway dot. 

Voyager 1, the farthest man-made object in space, hasn&#x27;t sent coherent data to Earth since November. NASA has been trying to diagnose what the Voyager mission&#x27;s project manager, Suzanne Dodd, called the &quot;most serious issue&quot; the robotic probe has faced since she took the job in 2010. The spacecraft encountered a glitch in one of its computers that has eliminated its ability to send engineering and science data back to Earth. The loss of Voyager 1 would cap decades of scientific breakthroughs and signal the beginning of the end for a mission that has given shape to humanity&#x27;s most distant ambition and inspired generations to look to the skies.

                              <span>The hype around AI language models has companies scrambling to hire prompt engineers to improve their AI queries and create new products. But new research hints that the AI may be better at prompt engineering than humans, indicating many of these jobs could be short-lived as the technology evolves and automates the role. IEEE Spectrum: Battle and Gollapudi decided to systematically test [PDF] how different prompt engineering strategies impact an LLM&#x27;s ability to solve grade school math questions. They tested three different open source language models with 60 different prompt combinations each. What they found was a surprising lack of consistency. Even chain-of-thought prompting sometimes helped and other times hurt performance. &quot;The only real trend may be no trend,&quot; they write. &quot;What&#x27;s best for any given model, dataset, and prompting strategy is likely to be specific to the particular combination at hand.&quot; 

There is an alternative to the trial-and-error style prompt engineering that yielded such inconsistent results: Ask the language model to devise its own optimal prompt. Recently, new tools have been developed to automate this process. Given a few examples and a quantitative success metric, these tools will iteratively find the optimal phrase to feed into the LLM. Battle and his collaborators found that in almost every case, this automatically generated prompt did better than the best prompt found through trial-and-error. And, the process was much faster, a couple of hours rather than several days of searching.

But it&#x27;s time to stop being a tourist. It&#x27;s time to commit. 
 So despite my earlier reservations about giving up on TextMate, I&#x27;ve decided to make Windows my new primary abode.

                              <span>Trust in AI technology and the companies that develop it is dropping, in both the U.S. and around the world, according to new data from Edelman shared first with Axios. Axios reports: Globally, trust in AI companies has dropped to 53%, down from 61% five years ago. In the U.S., trust has dropped 15 percentage points (from 50% to 35%) over the same period. Trust in AI is low across political lines. Democrats trust in AI companies is 38%, independents are at 25% and Republicans at 24%. Tech is losing its lead as the most trusted sector. Eight years ago, technology was the leading industry in trust in 90% of the countries Edelman studies. Today, it is the most trusted in only half of countries.
 
People in developing countries are more likely to embrace AI than those in developed ones. Respondents in France, Canada, Ireland, UK, U.S., Germany, Australia, the Netherlands and Sweden reject the growing use of AI by a three-to-one margin, Edelman said. By contrast, acceptance outpaces resistance by a wide margin in developing markets such as Saudi Arabia, India, China, Kenya, Nigeria and Thailand. &quot;When it comes to AI regulation, the public&#x27;s response is pretty clear: &#x27;What regulation?&#x27;,&quot; said Edelman global technology chair Justin Westcott. &quot;There&#x27;s a clear and urgent call for regulators to meet the public&#x27;s expectations head on.&quot;

As TechCrunch notes, it&#x27;s &quot;a crucial step before the company opens the program up to the public.&quot; From the report: The step forward comes just a few days after Waymo won the ability to start charging for rides in expanded territory across both Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area. Waymo didn&#x27;t offer a timeline for when it plans to start offering autonomous rides to the citizens of Austin. When it does, it will become the fourth city where the company&#x27;s robotaxis are officially in operation, following LA, SF and Phoenix.

According to Fidelity, in documents filed with the Maine attorney general&#x27;s office, miscreants &quot;likely acquired&quot; information about 28,268 people&#x27;s life insurance policies after infiltrating Infosys.
 
&quot;At this point, [Infosys] are unable to determine with certainty what personal information was accessed as a result of this incident,&quot; the insurer noted in a letter [PDF] sent to customers. However, the US-headquartered firm says it &quot;believes&quot; the data included: na…</span>

                              <span>JPMorgan helped some of its corporate customers slash manual work by almost 90% (alternative source) with its cashflow management tool that runs on AI, bringing the largest US bank one step closer to charging for this service. From a report: &quot;We are going to keep investing into this solution because we see that we&#x27;re starting to really crack this workflow,&quot; said Tony Wimmer, head of data and analytics at JPMorgan&#x27;s wholesale payments unit, in an interview. Since launching about a year ago, his firm now has about 2,500 clients using the product, he said. 

The tool, which allows corporate treasuries to analyse and forecast cash flows, has seen &quot;tremendous&quot; interest from its clients who currently use it for free, Wimmer said. His firm is considering charging its customers in the future to use the solution, dubbed Cash Flow Intelligence. The world&#x27;s biggest banks have been stepping up their use of artificial intelligence with the aim of lifting productivity and reducing costs. JPMorgan&#x27;s Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has said the technology could eventually allow employers to shrink the workweek to just 3.5 days. JPMorgan set a target of $1 billion in &quot;business value&quot; generated by AI in 2023, and the firm increased that goal to $1.5 billion at its investor day in May.

                              <span>A washing-machine-sized satellite is to &quot;name and shame&quot; the worst methane polluters in the oil and gas industry. From a report: MethaneSat will provide the first near-comprehensive global view of leaks of the potent greenhouse gas from the oil and gas sector, and all of the data will be made public. It will provide high-resolution data over wider areas than existing satellites. Methane, also called natural gas, is responsible for 30% of the global heating driving the climate crisis. Leaks from the fossil fuel industry are a major source of human-caused emissions and stemming these is the fastest single way to curb temperature rises. 

MethaneSat was developed by the Environmental Defense Fund, a US NGO, in partnership with the New Zealand Space Agency and cost $88m to build and launch. Earlier EDF measurements from planes show methane emissions were 60% higher than calculated estimates published by US authorities and elsewhere. More than 150 countries have signed a global methane pledge to cut their emissions of the gas by 30% from 2020 levels by 2030. Some oil and gas companies have made similar pledges, and new regulations to limit methane leaks are being worked on in the US, EU, Japan and South Korea. 

The EDF&#x27;s senior vice-president, Mark Brownstein, said: &quot;MethaneSat is a tool for accountability . I&#x27;m sure many people think this could be used to name and shame companies who are poor emissions performers, and that&#x27;s true. But [it] can [also] help document progress that leading companies are making in reducing their emissions.&quot; The oil and gas industry knows how to stop leaks and the cost of doing so is usually very modest, said Steven Hamburg, the EDF&#x27;s chief scientist and MethaneSat project leader: &quot;Some call it low hanging fruit. I like to call it fruit lying on the ground.&quot;

                              <span>41 state attorneys general penned a letter to Meta&#x27;s top attorney on Wednesday saying complaints are skyrocketing across the United States about Facebook and Instagram user accounts being stolen, and declaring &quot;immediate action&quot; necessary to mitigate the rolling threat. Wired: The coalition of top law enforcement officials, spearheaded by New York attorney general Letitia James, says the &quot;dramatic and persistent spike&quot; in complaints concerning account takeovers amounts to a &quot;substantial drain&quot; on governmental resources, as many stolen accounts are also tied to financial crimes -- some of which allegedly profits Meta directly. 

&quot;We have received a number of complaints of threat actors fraudulently charging thousands of dollars to stored credit cards,&quot; says the letter addressed to Meta&#x27;s chief legal officer, Jennifer Newstead. &quot;Furthermore, we have received reports of threat actors buying advertisements to run on Meta.&quot; &quot;We refuse to operate as the customer service representatives of your company,&quot; the officials add. &quot;Proper investment in response and mitigation is mandatory.&quot;

                              <span>Epic Games, in a blog post: We recently announced that Apple approved our Epic Games Sweden AB developer account. We intended to use that account to bring the Epic Games Store and Fortnite to iOS devices in Europe thanks to the Digital Markets Act (DMA). To our surprise, Apple has terminated that account and now we cannot develop the Epic Games Store for iOS. This is a serious violation of the DMA and shows Apple has no intention of allowing true competition on iOS devices. 

The DMA requires Apple to allow third-party app stores, like the Epic Games Store. Article 6(4) of the DMA says: &quot;The gatekeeper shall allow and technically enable the installation and effective use of third-party software applications or software application stores using, or interoperating with, its operating system and allow those software applications or software application stores to be accessed by means other than the relevant core platform services of that gatekeeper.&quot; 

In terminating Epic&#x27;s developer account, Apple is taking out one of the largest potential competitors to the Apple App Store. They are undermining our ability to be a viable competitor and they are showing other developers what happens when you try to compete with Apple or are critical of their unfair practices. If Apple maintains its power to kick a third party marketplace off iOS at its sole discretion, no reasonable developer would be willing to utilize a third party app store, because they could be permanently separated from their audience at any time. Apple said one of the reasons it terminated Epic&#x27;s developer account only a few weeks after approving it was because the Fortnite-maker publicly criticized its proposed DMA compliance plan, Epic said.

                              <span>During a recent Morgan Stanley conference, Warner Bros. Discovery gaming boss J.B. Perrette discussed some of the company&#x27;s strategy for gaming going forward, and it includes more live-service, mobile, and free-to-play games. From a report: He said, &quot;We&#x27;re doubling down on games as an area where we think there is a lot more growth opportunity that we can tap into with the IP that we have and some of the capabilities we have on the studio where we&#x27;re uniquely positioned as both a publisher and a developer of games.&quot; 

Perrette said WBD&#x27;s recent gaming output has focused on AAA games for console, and that&#x27;s great when a game like Hogwarts Legacy sells 22 million copies and becomes the best-selling game of the year, but this kind of success is never guaranteed in what Perrette said was a &quot;volatile&quot; market. He pointed out that one of WBD&#x27;s latest big games, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, was a disappointment for the company. 

So the plan going forward, he said, is to help reduce volatility by focusing on core franchises and bringing at least some of them to the mobile and free-to-play space, as well as continuing to invest in live-service games that people play--and spend money on--over a long period of time. This will help WBD generate more consistent revenue, he said, going on to tease that WBD had some new mobile free-to-play games coming this year. Also worth noting is that just because WBD may push into new places, that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it will stop making big single-player AAA games.

                              <span>Spain has moved to block Sam Altman&#x27;s cryptocurrency project Worldcoin, the latest blow to a venture that has raised controversy in multiple countries by collecting customers&#x27; personal data using an eyeball-scanning &quot;orb.&quot; From a report: The AEPD, Spain&#x27;s data protection regulator, has demanded that Worldcoin immediately ceases collecting personal information in the country via the scans and that it stops using data it has already gathered. The regulator announced on Wednesday that it had taken the &quot;precautionary measure&quot; at the start of the week and had given Worldcoin 72 hours to demonstrate its compliance with the order. 

Worldcoin, co-founded by Altman in 2019, has been offering tokens of its own cryptocurrency to people around the world, in return for their consent to have their eyes scanned by an orb. The scans are used as a form of identification as it seeks to create a reliable mechanism to distinguish between humans and machines as artificial intelligence becomes more advanced.

                              <span>Carriers have gotten stricter about how many items you can take on board, no matter how small they are. From a report: Fanny packs. Cross-body bags. Shopping bags. Pillows and blankets. The Southwest Airlines gate agent rattled off so many items that counted toward the two carry-on bag limit on my flight to Baltimore, I thought it might be a playful jab at Spirit and Frontier and their rigid carry-on policing to collect more fees. But this was no joke. Southwest quietly began cracking down on carry-on bags on Feb. 22, ahead of the spring and summer travel rush, advising gate agents of the changes in a memo. This crackdown isn&#x27;t about bag size. It is about how many bags you have. 

Southwest isn&#x27;t alone in putting passengers&#x27; personal items in its crosshairs as a way to save precious bin space and speed up boarding. Delta and United agents have also recently asked me to stuff my small Lululemon bag in my backpack. One American Airlines frequent flier told me he watched gate agents in Sacramento, Calif., and Dallas list a litany of items that count as a personal item on weekend flights to Nashville, Tenn., last month. Carting all your stuff to the gate can save you time and often saves money, especially with some airlines&#x27; new, higher checked-baggage fees. Delta joined the club on Tuesday, announcing prices of $35 for your first bag and $45 for your second. But testing airlines&#x27; carry-on limits is now more likely to backfire, and lose you precious time as airlines make you consolidate items or check a bag at the gate.

Jones was noodling with Copilot Designer, the AI image generator that Microsoft debuted in March 2023, powered by OpenAI&#x27;s technology. Like with OpenAI&#x27;s DALL-E, users enter text prompts to create pictures. Creativity is encouraged to run wild. Since the month prior, Jones had been actively testing the product for vulnerabilities, a practice known as red-teaming. In that time, he saw the tool generate images that ran far afoul of Microsoft&#x27;s oft-cited responsible AI principles.

From a report: New semiconductor factories being built in the US by four of the biggest manufacturers -- Intel, TSMC, Samsung, and Micron -- could use more than twice as much electricity as the city of Seattle once they&#x27;re operational. These companies claim to run on renewable energy, but according to an analysis by nonprofit Stand.earth, that&#x27;s not entirely true. Semiconductors happen to make up a big chunk of a device&#x27;s carbon footprint. And unless companies turn to clean energy, they could wind up driving up greenhouse gas emissions as domestic chip manufacturing makes a comeback. 

The CHIPS and Science Act, which passed in 2022, set aside $52.7 billion in funding for domestic chip manufacturing. Now, the four companies scrutinized in the report have plans to build megafactories in Arizona, Ohio, Oregon, Idaho, Texas, and New York. Each of those megafactories alone could use as much electricity as a medium-sized town, according to the report. Cumulatively, nine facilities could eventually add 2.1 gigawatts in new electricity demand. &quot;We&#x27;re not slowing down on any of our sustainability commitments, even with our recently announced investments,&quot; Intel said in an email.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Krebs on Security: There are indications that U.S. healthcare giant Change Healthcare has made a $22 million extortion payment to the infamous BlackCat ransomware group (a.k.a. &quot;ALPHV&quot;) as the company struggles to bring services back online amid a cyberattack that has disrupted prescription drug services nationwide for weeks. However, the cybercriminal who claims to have given BlackCat access to Change&#x27;s network says the crime gang cheated them out of their share of the ransom, and that they still have the sensitive data Change reportedly paid the group to destroy. Meanwhile, the affiliate&#x27;s disclosure appears to have prompted BlackCat to cease operations entirely. [...]

                              <span>Warner Bros. Discovery said a password crackdown for its Max streaming service is coming later this year, joining competitors Netflix and Disney. TheWrap reports: JB Perrette, WBD&#x27;s CEO and president of global streaming and games, said the initiative would launch later this year with a broader rollout in 2025. &quot;We think, relative to the scale of our business, it&#x27;s a meaningful opportunity,&quot; Perrette said during Morgan Stanley&#x27;s 2024 Technology, Media &amp; Telecom Conference in San Francisco on Monday. The push to crack down on password sharing comes as Warner Bros. Discovery narrowed its streaming loss to $55 million during its fourth quarter of 2023, down from a loss of $217 million a year ago. For the full year, it swung to a profit of $103 million, compared to a loss of $1.59 billion in 2022.
 
Looking ahead, WBD said its DTC business would have &quot;modestly negative&quot; EBITDA in the first half of 2024 before turning profitable in the second half. WBD is targeting $1 billion of direct-to-consumer EBITDA in 2025. In its fourth quarter, Warner Bros. Discovery added 1.8 million subscribers in its direct-to-consumer division for a total of 97.7 million. The DTC segment&#x27;s results include Max, Discovery+ and traditional HBO cable subscriptions. Parrette also discussed interest in transactional ads, notes Ars Technica. Per Perrette: &quot;On the ad format size, we&#x27;ve made lots of improvements from where we were, but we still have a lot of ad format enhancements that will give us more things that we can go to marketers with, [like] shoppable ads [and] other elements of the ad format side of the house that we can improve.&quot;

                              <span>When pair programming, it&#x27;s important to rotate the pairs frequently, 
       but many organizations that do pair programming are reluctant to do that.
       Gabriel Robaina and Kieran Murphy ask
       the question: “What if we rotate pairs every day?” and worked with three
       teams through an exercise of daily pair rotation. They developed a
       lightweight methodology to help teams reflect on the benefits and
       challenges of pairing and how to solve them. Initial fears were overcome
       and teams discovered the benefits of frequently rotating pairs. They
       learned that pair swapping frequently greatly enhances the benefits of
       pairing. Their article shares the methodology they
       developed, their observations, and some common fears and insights shared
       by the participating team members.

                              <span>Richard Speed reports via The Register: Copilot in Windows is set to get even more assertive after Microsoft added a function that makes the AI assistant&#x27;s window pop up after a user&#x27;s cursor hovers over the icon in the task bar. [...] Windows Insiders on the Beta Channel â&quot; with the option to get the latest updates turned on â&quot; will soon find themselves on the receiving end of what Microsoft calls &quot;a new hover experience for Copilot in Windows&quot; from build 22635.3276.
 
If your mouse cursor happens to drift over to the Copilot icon on the taskbar, the Copilot pane will open to make users aware of the delights on offer. The result, we suspect, will be to educate users in the art of switching off the function. Much like Widgets, which will also make its unwanted presence felt should a user move a mouse over its icon. A swift hop into taskbar settings is all it takes to make the icons disappear, for now at least. The new feature is being piloted but considering the proximity of the Beta Channel to Release Preview, there is every chance the pop-up will, er, pop up in a release version of Windows before long.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Oregon has joined the small but growing list of states that have passed right-to-repair legislation. Oregon&#x27;s bill stands out for a provision that would prevent companies from requiring that official parts be unlocked with encrypted software checks before they will fully function. Bill SB 1596 passed Oregon&#x27;s House by a 42 to 13 margin. Gov. Tina Kotek has five days to sign the bill into law. Consumer groups and right-to-repair advocates praised the bill as &quot;the best bill yet,&quot; while the bill&#x27;s chief sponsor, state Sen. Janeen Sollman (D), pointed to potential waste reductions and an improved second-hand market for closing a digital divide.

                              <span>The loss of Arctic sea ice has long been a graphic measure of human-caused climate change, with wrenching images of suffering polar bears illustrating a worsening planetary crisis. Now, new research has found that Arctic Ocean sea ice is shrinking even faster than previously thought -- and that the Arctic may start to see its first &quot;ice-free&quot; days within the current decade. From a report: That troubling milestone could occur before the end of the decade or sometime in the 2030s -- as many as 10 years earlier than previous projections, according to a study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Reviews Earth and Environment. The study defines &quot;ice-free&quot; as when the Arctic Ocean has less than 1 million square kilometers, or 386,000 square miles, of ice. 

By midcentury -- 2035 to 2067 -- the Arctic could see consistent ice-free conditions in September, the month when sea ice concentrations are typically at their minimum, the study found. The precise timing of such losses depends on how soon humanity is able to reduce fossil fuel emissions that are contributing to global warming. Under a high-emission scenario in which fossil fuel use continues unabated, the Arctic would be ice-free between the months of May and January by 2100, the study says. Even under a low-emission scenario, the Arctic would still be ice-free between August and October by that same year.

                              <span>The SAT, a college admissions exam that for nearly a century was completed using paper and pencil, is now officially all-digital. From a report: This week, students in the U.S. will begin taking the new SAT on their own devices -- including a tablet or a laptop -- or on school devices. The test is also one hour shorter (down from three hours), has shorter reading passages and uses digital tools, like a highlighter, a graphing calculator and a bookmark to go back to skipped questions. The revamped test, which ditches the paper and pencil, aims to make cheating harder and grading easier. 

Students will still take the exam at a test center or at a high school. &quot;Today&#x27;s students, they do a lot of their living digitally, they do a lot of their learning digitally and they do a lot of their test taking digitally,&quot; says Priscilla Rodriguez, who oversees the SAT for the College Board, the organization behind the test. Throughout March and April, the College Board expects more than 1 million students to take the new digital SAT. Students can take the exam on Saturday test dates or during SAT School Days, where participating high schools offer the test to upperclassmen free of charge during the school day.

                              <span>Microsoft is ending support for its Android subsystem in Windows 11 next year. From a report: The software giant first announced it was bringing Android apps to Windows 11 with Amazon&#x27;s Appstore nearly three years ago, but this Windows Subsystem for Android will now be deprecated starting March 5th, 2025. &quot;Microsoft is ending support for the Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA),&quot; reads a new support document from Microsoft. &quot;As a result, the Amazon Appstore on Windows and all applications and games dependent on WSA will no longer be supported beginning March 5, 2025.&quot; 

If you currently use Android apps from the Amazon Appstore, then you&#x27;ll continue to have access to these past the support cutoff date, but you won&#x27;t be able to download any new ones once Microsoft makes its Android subsystem end of life next year. On March 6th (tomorrow), Windows 11 users will no longer be able to search for Amazon Appstore or associated Android apps from the Microsoft Store.

                              <span>Microsoft has filed a motion seeking to dismiss key parts of a lawsuit The New York Times filed against the company and Open AI, accusing them of copyright infringement. From a report: If you&#x27;ll recall, The Times sued both companies for using its published articles to train their GPT large language models (LLMs) without permission and compensation. In its filing, the company has accused The Times of pushing &quot;doomsday futurology&quot; by claiming that AI technologies pose a threat to independent journalism. It follows OpenAI&#x27;s court filing from late February that&#x27;s also seeking to dismiss some important elements on the case. 

Like OpenAI before it, Microsoft accused The Times of crafting &quot;unrealistic prompts&quot; in an effort to &quot;coax the GPT-based tools&quot; to spit out responses matching its content. It also compared the media organization&#x27;s lawsuit to Hollywood studios&#x27; efforts to &quot; stop a groundbreaking new technology:&quot; The VCR. Instead of destroying Hollywood, Microsoft explained, the VCR helped the entertainment industry flourish by opening up revenue streams. LLMs are a breakthrough in artificial intelligence, it continued, and Microsoft collaborated with OpenAI to &quot;help bring their extraordinary power to the public&quot; because it &quot;firmly believes in LLMs&#x27; capacity to improve the way people live and work.&quot;

                              <span>The U.S. government announced Tuesday sanctions against the founder of the notorious spyware company Intellexa and one of his business partners. From a report: This is the first time the U.S. government has targeted specific people, in addition to companies, with sanctions related to the misuse of commercial spyware. And it signifies an escalation of the White House and U.S. government&#x27;s efforts to curb the spyware industry. &quot;Today&#x27;s actions represent a tangible step forward in discouraging the misuse of commercial surveillance tools, which increasingly present a security risk to the United States and our citizens,&quot; said Brian E. Nelson, U.S Treasury&#x27;s under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, was quoted as saying in a press release. 

&quot;The United States remains focused on establishing clear guardrails for the responsible development and use of these technologies while also ensuring the protection of human rights and civil liberties of individuals around the world.&quot; The U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on Tal Dilian, the founder of Intellexa and a veteran of the spyware industry; and Sara Aleksandra Fayssal Hamou, who is not as well-known as Dilian. Hamou, according to the Treasury, has a leadership role in Intellexa, is an expert in off-shoring, and provided the company managerial services, such as renting office space in Greece.

From a report: The three Meta-owned platforms aren&#x27;t working for many users, with the widespread outage seeming to start around 10AM ET. Some users are experiencing issues logging in to their Meta Quest headsets, too. Facebook is logging users out of their accounts, leaving them unable to get back in. Meanwhile, over on Instagram, some users, including several of us at The Verge, can&#x27;t refresh their feeds. YouTube is down, too.

                              <span>Bitcoin surged to a record as demand from new US exchange-traded funds and a looming reduction in the token&#x27;s supply growth fuel a breathtaking rebound in the original cryptocurrency. From a report: The largest digital asset rose as much as 2.5% to $69,191.95 as of 10:10 a.m. Tuesday in New York. Bitcoin has climbed about 62% so far in 2024, outperforming global stocks and spreading optimism across the digital-asset market. 

In an ironic twist, Bitcoin owes much of its resurgence to a regulator long-viewed as hostile to crypto: the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC approved spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in early January after suffering a legal defeat last year in its attempt to reject them. The move has widened the mass-market accessibility of Bitcoin, helping the crypto sector to turn the page following a bear market in 2022 and a string of subsequent bankruptcies, including the implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried&#x27;s FTX exchange.

                              <span>Hackers backed by the North Korean government gained a major win when Microsoft left a Windows zero-day unpatched for six months after learning it was under active exploitation. From a report: Even after Microsoft patched the vulnerability last month, the company made no mention that the North Korean threat group Lazarus had been using the vulnerability since at least August to install a stealthy rootkit on vulnerable computers. The vulnerability provided an easy and stealthy means for malware that had already gained administrative system rights to interact with the Windows kernel. Lazarus used the vulnerability for just that. Even so, Microsoft has long said that such admin-to-kernel elevations don&#x27;t represent the crossing of a security boundary, a possible explanation for the time Micros…</span>

                              <span>&quot;Linux gained from 3% to 4% in 8 months,&quot; writes longtime Slashdot reader bobdevine. Linuxiac reports: According to the latest data from StatCounter, a leading web traffic analysis tool, Linux&#x27;s market share has reached 4.03%. At first glance, the number might seem modest, but it represents a significant leap. Let&#x27;s break it down. It took Linux 30 years to secure a 3% share of desktop operating systems, a milestone reached last June. Impressively, the open-source operating system has surged by an additional 1% in the last eight months.

                              <span>During Ballmer&#x27;s reign as CEO of Microsoft, the company always made plenty of money. While the stock traded sideways, Ballmer made sure it was still raining dividends. Yet, today, that era of Microsoft is not looked upon too fondly. It&#x27;s seen as being anchored in the company&#x27;s historic paranoia, Windows-centric world view, and as missing the boat on mobile.
 Then along came Satya Nadella. 
Now, it&#x27;s tempting to write a hagiography of whoever is CEO when a company is flying high, and Microsoft has soared in recent years. It&#x27;s currently the most valuable company in the world. The only one with an over three trillion dollar market capitalization. But we don&#x27;t need to be blinded by the halo effect to realize that Microsoft under Nadella is a fundamentally different company to the one it was un…</span>

                              <span>When we gradually replace a legacy system, we have plenty of cases
       where the legacy system and its replacement need to interact. Since these
       legacy systems are often difficult, and costly, to change, we need a
       mechanism that can integrate elements of the replacement while minimizing
       the impact to the legacy system. Ian Cartwright, Rob Horn, and
       James Lewis explain how we can use Event Interception on
       state-changing events, allowing us to forward them to the
       replacement.

                              <span>According to the San Francisco police department, police have made the first arrest in relation to several recent vehicle arsons, including the crowd attack of a Waymo robotaxi last month in Chinatown. The San Francisco Standard reports: Police say officers arrested a man meeting the description of a person suspected of lighting several vehicles on fire. That man was arrested on Feb. 27 near Union Square. The department did not share the suspect&#x27;s name because it said the case is open and remains under investigation. Nor did the department comment on which other vehicle fires the suspect may have been suspected of starting. Several Teslas were set alight in the weeks after the Waymo arson. The suspect was also found to have had methamphetamine on them.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Jack Teixeira, the National Guard airman who leaked confidential military documents on Discord, agreed Monday to plead guilty, promising to cooperate with officials attempting to trace the full extent of government secrets leaked. Under the plea deal, Teixeira will serve a much-reduced sentence, The Boston Globe reported, recommended between 11 years and 16 years and eight months. Previously, Teixeira had pleaded not guilty to six counts of &quot;willful retention and transmission of national defense information,&quot; potentially facing up to 10 years per count. During a pretrial hearing, prosecutors suggested he could face up to 25 years, The Globe reported.
 
By taking the deal, Teixeira will also avoid being charged with violations of the Espionage Act, The New York Times reported, including allegations of unlawful gathering and unauthorized removal of top-secret military documents. According to prosecutors, it was clear that Teixeira, 22, was leaking sensitive documents -- including national security secrets tied to US foreign adversaries and allies, including Russia, China, Ukraine, and South Korea -- just to impress his friends on Discord -- some of them teenage boys. Investigators found no evidence of espionage. US District Judge Indira Talwani will decide whether or not to sign off on the deal at a hearing scheduled for September 27.

To gain acceptance, Roku devices pop up a dialog box that can only be dismissed if you accept the new terms or turn off your Roku and stop using it. As expected, much discussion has ensued in the Roku community.
 
Per the Roku Dispute Resolution Terms, users can opt out within 30 days of being subject to the new terms by sending a surface mail request to General Counsel, Roku Inc., 1701 Junction Court, Suite 100, San Jose, CA 95112. One poster in the community forum noted that the effective date of the change was Feb 20th, which may shorten the 30 day period for opting out. Longtime Slashdot reader blastard also shared the news.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Liliputing: Yuzu is a free and open source emulator that makes it possible to run Nintendo Switch games on Windows, Linux, and Android devices. First released in 2018, the software has been under constant development since then (the Android port was released less than a year ago). But last week Nintendo sued the developers, claiming that the primary purpose of the software is to circumvent Nintendo Switch encryption and allow users to play pirated games. Rather than fight the case in court, Tropic Haze (the developers behind Yuzu) have agreed to a settlement which involves paying $2.4 million in damages to Nintendo and basically shutting down Yuzu.
 
As part of a permanent injunction, Tropic Haze has agreed to stop distributing, advertising, or promoting Yuzu or any of its source code or features or any other &quot;software or devices that circumvent Nintendo&#x27;s technical protection measures.&quot; The court is also ordering the developers to turn over the yuzu-emu.org website to Nintendo and bars them &quot;from supporting or facilitating access&quot; to any other related websites, social media, chatrooms, or apps. In one of the more bizarre parts of the court order, the Yuzu team is told to delete all &quot;circumvention devices,&quot; which includes any tools used for development of Yuzu and &quot;all copies of Yuzu.&quot;

                              <span>Gartner: By 2026, traditional search engine volume will drop 25%, with search marketing losing market share to AI chatbots and other virtual agents, according to Gartner. &quot;Organic and paid search are vital channels for tech marketers seeking to reach awareness and demand generation goals,&quot; said Alan Antin, Vice President Analyst at Gartner. &quot;Generative AI (GenAI) solutions are becoming substitute answer engines, replacing user queries that previously may have been executed in traditional search engines. This will force companies to rethink their marketing channels strategy as GenAI becomes more embedded across all aspects of the enterprise.&quot; 

With GenAI driving down the cost of producing content, there is an impact around activities including keyword strategy and website domain authority scoring. Search engine algorithms will further value the quality of content to offset the sheer amount of AI-generated content, as content utility and quality still reigns supreme for success in organic search results. There will also be a greater emphasis placed on watermarking and other means to authenticate high-value content. Government regulations across the globe are already holding companies accountable as they begin to require the identification of marketing content assets that AI creates. This will likely play a role in how search engines will display such digital content.

                              <span>Anthropic, a leading artificial intelligence startup, unveiled its Claude 3 series of AI models today, designed to meet the diverse needs of enterprise customers with a balance of intelligence, speed, and cost efficiency. The lineup includes three models: Opus, Sonnet, and the upcoming Haiku. From a report: The star of the lineup is Opus, which Anthropic claims is more capable than any other openly available AI system on the market, even outperforming leading models from rivals OpenAI and Google. &quot;Opus is capable of the widest range of tasks and performs them exceptionally well,&quot; said Anthropic cofounder and CEO Dario Amodei in an interview with VentureBeat. Amodei explained that Opus outperforms top AI models like GPT-4, GPT-3.5 and Gemini Ultra on a wide range of benchmarks. This includes topping the leaderboard on academic benchmarks like GSM-8k for mathematical reasoning and MMLU for expert-level knowledge. 

&quot;It seems to outperform everyone and get scores that we haven&#x27;t seen before on some tasks,&quot; Amodei said. While companies like Anthropic and Google have not disclosed the full parameters of their leading models, the reported benchmark results from both companies imply Opus either matches or surpasses major alternatives like GPT-4 and Gemini in core capabilities. This, at least on paper, establishes a new high watermark for commercially available conversational AI. Engineered for complex tasks requiring advanced reasoning, Opus stands out in Anthropic&#x27;s lineup for its superior performance. Sonnet, the mid-range model, offers businesses a more cost-effective solution for routine data analysis and knowledge work, maintaining high performance without the premium price tag of the flagship model. Meanwhile, Haiku is designed to be swift and economical, suited for applications such as consumer-facing chatbots, where responsiveness and cost are crucial factors. Amodei told VentureBeat he expects Haiku to launch publicly in a matter of &quot;weeks, not months.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: India has waded into global AI debate by issuing an advisory that requires &quot;significant&quot; tech firms to get government permission before launching new models. India&#x27;s Ministry of Electronics and IT issued the advisory to firms on Friday. The advisory -- not published on public domain but a copy of which TechCrunch has reviewed -- also asks tech firms to ensure that their services or products &quot;do not permit any bias or discrimination or threaten the integrity of the electoral process.&quot; 

Though the ministry admits the advisory is not legally binding, India&#x27;s IT Deputy Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar says the notice is &quot;signalling that this is the future of regulation.&quot; He adds: &quot;We are doing it as an advisory today asking you to comply with it.&quot; In a tweet Monday, Chandrasekhar said the advisory is aimed at &quot;untested AI platforms deploying on the India internet&quot; and doesn&#x27;t apply to startups.

                              <span>JetBlue Airways and Spirit Airlines announced on Monday that they would walk away from their planned $3.8 billion merger after federal antitrust regulators successfully challenged the deal in court. JetBlue said it would pay Spirit $69 million to exit the deal. From a report: A federal judge in Boston blocked the proposed merger on Jan. 16, siding with the Justice Department in determining that the merger would reduce competition in the industry and give airlines more leeway to raise ticket prices. The judge, William G. Young of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, noted that Spirit played a vital role in the market as a low-cost carrier and that travelers would have fewer options if JetBlue absorbed it. 

&quot;We are proud of the work we did with Spirit to lay out a vision to challenge the status quo, but given the hurdles to closing that remain, we decided together that both airlines&#x27; interests are better served by moving forward independently,&quot; JetBlue&#x27;s chief executive, Joanna Geraghty, said in a statement on Monday. &quot;We wish the very best going forward to the entire Spirit team.&quot; JetBlue and Spirit appealed Judge Young&#x27;s decision. JetBlue filed an appellate brief last week arguing that the deal should be allowed to go through. But in a regulatory filing on Jan. 26, JetBlue said it might terminate the deal. Spirit said in its own filing the same day that it believed &quot;there is no basis for terminating&quot; the agreement.

                              <span>The EU Commission on Monday fined Apple about $2 billion for stifling competition from rival music streaming services. In a blog post, Spotify writes:
 Apple&#x27;s rules muzzled Spotify and other music streaming services from sharing with our users directly in our app about various benefits -- denying us the ability to communicate with them about how to upgrade and the price of subscriptions, promotions, discounts, or numerous other perks. Of course, Apple Music, a competitor to these apps, is not barred from the same behaviour. By requiring Apple to stop its illegal conduct in the EU, the EC is putting consumers first. It is a basic concept of free markets -- customers should know what options they have, and customers, not Apple, should decide what to buy, and where, when and how. 

While we appreciate the EC addressing this important case, we also know that the details matter. Apple has routinely defied laws and court decisions in other markets. So we&#x27;re looking forward to the next steps that will hopefully clearly and conclusively address Apple&#x27;s long-standing unfair practices. 

From the beginning, the foundational belief of the internet is that it should be a fair and open ecosystem. That belief has fueled growth, innovation and discovery around the world. Today the leading way people access the internet is via their mobile phones. So why should the same principles not apply? And while we are pleased that this case delivers some justice, it does not solve Apple&#x27;s bad behaviour towards developers beyond music streaming in other markets around the world. Our work will not be done until we succeed in securing a truly fair digital marketplace everywhere and our commitment to helping to make this a reality remains unwavering.

                              <span>&quot;It never occurred to me that having no visual imagery was unusual...&quot; writes a science journalist at the Guardian. 

&quot;It&#x27;s not that I forget what I look like, but I am sometimes a little surprised, and don&#x27;t feel connected to my outward appearance as a matter of identity.&quot;

There&#x27;s been a surge of research on how aphantasia affects our lives... [F]or some it affects images alone; some can&#x27;t imagine other sensory information, like sounds. Some people with aphantasia have visualizations when they dream (I do), and others don&#x27;t. There&#x27;s evidence that it can make it harder for people to recall visual details, though other studies show that aphants perform better on some memory tests unrelated to imagery... But overall, people with aphantasia don&#x27;t seem to have serious problems navigating their day-to-day lives, unlike those with more severe memory conditions like episodic amnesia... 

Some people consider aphantasia to be a deficit and wish they could reverse it. People have claimed they can train their way out of aphantasia, or use psychedelics to regain some sense of mental imagery (the jury is out on whether that works). I have no desire for this — my mind is plenty busy without a stream of imagery. If I was born with imagery, it would be commonplace for me, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d enjoy it. But I already can find myself overwhelmed with thoughts and feelings that have no visual aspects to them. 

Long-time Slashdot reader whoever57 writes that &quot;Personally, I never realized before reading this article that people could create mental images.&quot; (And they also wonder if people with the condition tend to go into STEM fields.) There&#x27;s what&#x27;s known as the &quot;red apple test,&quot; where you rate your own ability to visualize an apple on a scale of 1 to 5.

                              <span>A homeless man &quot;was taken into custody on suspicion of grand theft auto,&quot; reports the Los Angeles Times, &quot;after police said he tried to steal a Waymo self-driving car in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday night.&quot;


The man entered and tried to operate a Waymo vehicle that had stopped to let out a passenger at the corner of 1st and Main at 10:30 p.m., Los Angeles Police Department detective Meghan Aguilar said. After the man, whom a Waymo spokesman described as an &quot;unauthorized pedestrian,&quot; entered the vehicle, the company&#x27;s Rider Support team instructed him to exit the car. When he did not, the company contacted the police, &quot;who were then able to remove and arrest&quot; the man, said Chris Bonelli, a Waymo spokesman... 

No injuries were reported by the rider, and there was no damage to the vehicle, Bonelli said. The car was stationary during the entire incident because an unauthorized person was identified by the company to be in the vehicle, according to Waymo.

                              <span>In 1970 an Oregon man discovered a body with &quot;clear signs of foul play&quot;. 

NPR reports that &quot;The identity of the young woman remained a mystery — until Thursday.&quot;


State authorities identified the woman as Sandra Young, a teenager from Portland who went missing between 1968 and 1969. Her identity was discovered through advanced DNA technology, which has helped solve stubborn cold cases in recent years. The case&#x27;s breakthrough came last year in January, when a person uploaded their DNA to the genealogy database GEDMatch and the tool immediately determined that the DNA donor was a distant family member of Young.... 

From there, a genetic genealogist working with local law enforcement helped track down other possible relatives and encouraged them to provide their DNA. That work eventually led to Young&#x27;s sister and other family members, who confirmed that Young went missing around the same time.

                              <span>Taiwan doesn&#x27;t have parking meters, writes long-time Slashdot reader Badlands, &quot;but rather roving armies of maids on electric scooters that cruise their area with their smartphone and take a pic of your license plate and timestamp it, leaving a receipt under your windshield wipers.&quot; 

But now one city will try &quot;smart parking&quot; services — which will also help drivers find vacant parking spots, according to Taiwan News:

The service will utilize 3,471 geomagnetic sensors installed along 122 stretches of roadway in Banqiao, Yonghe, Zhonghe and Xindian Districts, according to a press release. The sensors will be linked to a publicly available online database to indicate where open parking spaces are available. 


The &quot;New Taipei Street Parking Inquiry Service&quot; will be accessible through a main website run by the Department of Transportation. The service is also linked to two smartphone applications... Payments can be made automatically by linking one&#x27;s app profile to their smartphone&#x27;s telecommunications provider... For drivers that use spaces without linking their phone and vehicle to the smart network, cameras located along the street where the sensors are installed will allow the city to identify and bill drivers via mail, based on their vehicle&#x27;s registration information.

                              <span>&quot;NASA said Friday it is shutting down a $2 billion satellite refueling project,&quot; reports UPI, &quot;after criticizing the project&#x27;s contractor for poor performance.&quot;

The agency in a statement said it will discontinue the On-orbit Servicing, Assembly and Manufacturing 1 project after nearly a decade of work due to &quot;continued technical, cost, and schedule challenges, and a broader community evolution away from refueling unprepared spacecraft, which has led to a lack of a committed partner.&quot; [...] The spacecraft would have utilized an attached Space Infrastructure Dexterous Robot (SPIDER) to refuel the Landsat, assemble a communications antenna and demonstrate in-space manufacture of a 32-foot carbon fiber composite beam to verify the capability of constructing large spacecraft structures in orbit... An audit from NASA&#x27;s Inspector General, however, found OSAM-1 was on track to exceed the projected $2.05 billion budget and would not make its December 2026 launch date, laying the blame on the &quot;poor performance of Maxar.&quot; 

&quot;NASA and Maxar officials acknowledged that Maxar underestimated the scope and complexity of the work, lacked full understanding of NASA technical requirements, and were deficient in necessary expertise,&quot; the report read. 

The report also noted Maxar was &quot;no longer profiting from their work on OSAM-1,&quot; after which the xproject appeared not &quot;to be a high priority for Maxar in terms of the quality of its staffing.&quot;

[I]n a demonstration of the risks of connected, autonomous AI ecosystems, a group of researchers has created one of what they claim are the first generative AI worms — which can spread from one system to another, potentially stealing data or deploying malware in the process. &quot;It basically means that now you have the ability to conduct or to perform a new kind of cyberattack that hasn&#x27;t been seen before,&quot; says Ben Nassi, a Cornell Tech researcher behind the research.

But is this part of a concerning trend?

Microsoft plans to absorb its excess heat with a steady flow of air and, as needed, evaporated drinking water. Use of the latter is projected to reach more than 50 million gallons every year. That might be a burden in the best of times. As of 2023, it seemed absurd. Phoenix had just endured its hottest summer ever, with 55 days of temperatures above 110 degrees. …</span>

ACM plans to open its entire archive of over 600,000 articles when its five-year transition to full Open Access is complete (January 2026 target date). 

&quot;They are right...&quot; the site&#x27;s editor-in-chief told Slashdot. &quot;We need to get Google to reindex the new site ASAP.&quot;

                              <span>Long-time Slashdot reader AmiMoJo quotes Tom&#x27;s Hardware: A Geekbench 6 result features what is likely the first-ever look at the single-core performance of the Taishan V120, developed by Huawei&#x27;s HiSilicon subsidiary (via @Olrak29_ on X). The single-core score indicates that Taishan V120 cores are roughly on par with AMD&#x27;s Zen 3 cores from late 2020, which could mean Huawei&#x27;s technology isn&#x27;t that far behind cutting-edge Western chip designers. 

The Taishan V120 core was first spotted in Huawei&#x27;s Kirin 9000s smartphone chip, which uses four of the cores alongside two efficiency-focused Arm Cortex A510 cores. Since Kirin 9000s chips are produced using SMIC&#x27;s second-generation 7nm node (which may make it illegal to sell internationally according to U.S. lawmakers), it would also seem likely that the Taishan V120 core tested in Geekbench 6 is also made on the second-generation 7nm node. The benchmark result doesn&#x27;t really say much about what the actual CPU is, with the only hint being &#x27;Huawei Cloud OpenStack Nova.&#x27; This implies it&#x27;s a Kunpeng server CPU, which may either be the Kunpeng 916, 920, or 930. While we can only guess which one it is, it&#x27;s almost certain to be the 930 given the high single-core performance shown in the result. By contrast, the few Geekbench 5 results for the Kunpeng 920 show it performing well behind AMD&#x27;s first-generation Epyc Naples from 2017.

                              <span>This week Linux Foundation Charities launched &quot;a groundbreaking open source software solution for real-time fraud prevention&quot; named Tazama — &quot;with support from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.&quot; 

They&#x27;re calling it &quot;the first-ever open source platform dedicated to enhancing fraud management in digital payments.&quot;

Until now, the financial industry has grappled with proprietary and often costly solutions that have limited access and adaptability for many, especially in developing economies. 

This challenge is underscored by the Global Anti-Scam Alliance, which reported that nearly $1 trillion was lost to online fraud in 2022. Tazama challenges this status quo by providing a powerful, scalable, and cost-effective alternative that democratizes access to advanced financial monitoring tools that can help combat fraud... The solution&#x27;s architecture emphasizes data sovereignty, privacy, and transparency, aligning with the priorities of governments worldwide. Hosted by LF Charities, which will support the operation and function of the project, Tazama showcases the scalability and robustness of open source solutions, particularly in critical infrastructure like national payment switches. 

Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation, described their reaction as &quot;excited to see an open source solution that not only enhances financial security but also provides a platform for our community to actively contribute to a project with broad societal impacts.&quot; 

And the announcement also includes a comment from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation&#x27;s deputy director for payment systems. &quot;This pioneering open source platform helps address critical challenges like fraud detection and compliance and paves the way for innovative, inclusive financial solutions that serve everyone, especially those in low-income countries. 

&quot;The launch of Tazama signifies another stride towards securing and democratizing digital financial services.&quot;

                              <span>&quot;These days in San Francisco, every major business closure triggers a rush to assign blame,&quot; argues the San Francisco Standard:


When Macy&#x27;s announced this week that it would shutter its flagship store in Union Square, it unleashed a wave of mourning and recriminations... Mayor London Breed and other local pols like state Sen. Scott Wiener tried to allay fears that Macy&#x27;s was leaving because of crime, noting the planned closure is one of 150 nationwide. But in a tough election year, it seems few had the appetite to listen to her call for nuance... 

The unavoidable truth is the pandemic hollowed out downtown San Francisco&#x27;s offices and led to an exodus of tech staffers who preferred remote work. It meant the loss of thousands of people who had reason to regularly stroll by Macy&#x27;s and so m…</span>

In terms of operating systems used by Rustaceans, the situation is very similar to the results from 2022, with Linux being the most popular choice of Rust users [69.7%], followed by macOS [33.5%] and Windows [31.9%], which have a very similar share of usage. Rust programmers target a diverse set of platforms with their Rust programs, even though the most popular target by far is still a Linux machine [85.4%]. We can see a slight uptick in users targeting WebAssembly [27.1%], embedded and mobile platforms, which speaks to the versatility of Rust.

                              <span>It completed the most precise landing ever on the moon — albeit upside-down. And then it faced a &quot;lunar night&quot; lasting about two weeks where temperatures drop to -270 degrees Fahrenheit, reports the Times of India. 

But then, &quot;Despite not being designed for the extreme temperatures, SLIM surprised scientists by coming back to life after the two-week-long lunar night.&quot;

More from Space.com:
The lander woke up on February 26 during extremely hot temperatures of 212 Fahrenheit (100 Celsius) in its region and has been making contact here and there with Earth in the days since. Most recently, SLIM attempted observations with its multiband spectroscopic camera, but &quot;it did not work properly,&quot; JAXA officials wrote. &quot;This seems to be due to the effects of overnight,&quot; the update continued, referring to the frigid two-week-long lunar night that SLIM experienced before the sun shone near Shioli crater again. &quot;But we will continue to investigate based on the data we have obtained for the next opportunity....&quot; 

&quot;We received so much support for our operations after the lunar night,&quot; the agency posted on social media — adding &quot;thank you!&quot; 

The Times of India reports that &quot;JAXA officially announced SLIM&#x27;s return to a dormant state on March 1, sharing an image of the lunar surface captured by the probe.&quot; 

Above the photo, JAXA posted this hopeful message. &quot;Although the probability of a failure increases with the repeated severe temperature cycles, SLIM operation will attempt to resume when the sun rises (late March). #GoodAfterMoon.&quot; 

And Space.com notes that &quot;Despite all, SLIM has met both main and extended mission objectives: Landing precisely on the moon, deploying two tiny rovers and conducting science with its navigation camera and its spectroscopic camera, particularly searching for signs of olivine on the surface.&quot;

On February 14, 2024, the Court of Appeal of Paris issued an order stating that Orange, a major French telecom provider, had infringed the copyight of Entr&#x27;Ouvert&#x27;s Lasso software and violated the GPL. 

They ordered Orange to pay €500,000 in compensatory damages and €150,000 for moral damages. 

This case has been ongoing for many years. Entr&#x27;ouvert is the publisher of Lasso, a reference library for the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) protocol, an open standard for identity providers to authenticate users and pass authentication tokens to online services. This is the open protocol that enables single sign-on (SSO). The Lasso product is dual licensed by Entr&#x27;Ouvert under GPL or commercial licenses. 

In 2005, Orange won a contract with the French Agency for the Development of Electronic Administration to develop parts of the service-public.fr portal, which allows users to interact online with the government for administrative procedures. Orange used the Lasso software in the solution, but did not pass on the rights to its modifications free of charge under GPL, or make the source code to its modifications available. Entr&#x27;Ouvert sued Orange in 2010, and the case wended its way through the courts, turning on, among other things, issues of proof of Entr&#x27;Ouvert &#x27;s copyright interest in the software, and whether the case properly sounded in breach of contract or copyright infringement... 

The compensatory damages were based on both lost profits of the plaintiff and disgorgement of profits of Orange. Moral damages compensate the plaintiff for harm to reputation or other non-monetary injury.

                              <span>America&#x27;s Federal Aviation administration &quot;will require a fix for a new 737 MAX design problem discovered by Boeing that, although it&#x27;s a remote possibility, could theoretically disable the jet&#x27;s engine anti-ice system,&quot; reports the Seattle Times:

A different flaw in the MAX&#x27;s engine anti-ice system design drew scrutiny in January and forced the company to drop a request for an exemption from key safety regulations. And now, it&#x27;s not just the MAX with an engine anti-ice system problem. Airlines have reported a separate issue with a similar system on Boeing&#x27;s 787 Dreamliner that has caused what the FAA calls &quot;relatively minor&quot; damage to the engine inlets on some two dozen of these widebody jets in service. 

Though the FAA considers neither problem to be an immediate risk to flight safety,…</span>

                              <span>Strangely, a recent bathroom renovation crystalized my perspective on product development.
When being asked to choose between towel hooks or a towel bar, the choice was obvious: Hooks, of course.
Hooks take up no space. Towel bars suck up space.
Hooks hold towels no matter how you place them. Towel bars require towels to be balanced lest they slide off.
Towels naturally look good and drape well on hooks. Towels on bars require effort to display well.
Hooks can hold anything with a loop or a bend or a catch — loofas, shower caps, hats, rain soaked jackets and backpacks, etc. Towel bars can’t hold nearly as much, even though they take up much more space.
Hooks can hold multiple towels at once, with enough air getting to multiple layers because of the uneven ridges that single point hanging creates. Towel bars layer wet towels, leaving ones at the bottom or middle struggling to dry.
You can’t mount a hook crookedly. You can absolutely mount a towel bar unevenly.
Reasons go on.
But what do towel hooks have to do with product development? For me, just about everything. They’re a frame, they’re a lens, they’re aspirational. A hook holds more than towels — it holds lessons in how to build.
We aim to make hooks. I want our products full of hooks. Simple, flexible, you-can’t-do-it-wrong hooks. Hooks that just work, no fuss.
When working on new products, new features, and improving existing stuff, I’m visualizing the “hook-ness” of what we&#x27;re building. Making small, flexible features with minimal surface area that can be used intuitively in obvious ways without the possibility of doing it wrong. That’s the magic formula, that’s our model.
The unassuming, humble hook is a high bar.

                              <span>Space.com writes that NASA&#x27;s plan to return samples from Mars to the earth &quot;is facing major challenges, according to a new report. 

&quot;Design, cost and scheduling are all significant obstacles, an audit report of NASA&#x27;s Mars Sample Return (MSR) Program by the agency&#x27;s Office of Inspector General (OIG) finds...&quot;

It involves landing on Mars to collect samples taken by the Perseverance rover and launching those samples to rendezvous with an orbiter, which will haul them to Earth. Perseverance is already on Mars, snagging and storing samples. But the program still needs to build a Sample Retrieval Lander and an Earth Return Orbiter, the latter being developed and funded by the European Space Agency. The Mars Sample Return program is one of the most technically complex, operationally demanding and ambitious robotic science missions ever undertaken by NASA, according to the OIG report. 

The report notes design, architecture and schedule issues with the Capture Containment and Return System. These design issues resulted in adding about $200 million to the budget and one year of lost schedule... There is concern that, due to the number and significance of cost increase indicators so far, the $7.4 billion estimate is &quot;premature and may be insufficient,&quot; the report finds. Now, the complexity... could drive costs to between $8 billion to $11 billion, the OIG report notes, citing a September 2023 Independent Review Board report. Notably, a July 2020 estimate listed costs of $2.5 to $3 billion. 

These new figures indicate significant financial challenges and uncertainties... Issues include inflation, supply chain problems and increases in funding requests for specific program components.

                              <span>Americans filing their taxes could face privacy threats, reports the Washington Post:
&quot;We just need your OK on a couple of things,&quot; TurboTax says as you prepare your tax return. 

Alarm bells should be ringing in your head at the innocuous tone. 

This is where America&#x27;s most popular tax-prep website asks you to sign away the ironclad privacy protections of your tax return, including the details of your income, home mortgage and student loan payments. With your permission to blab your money secrets, the company earns extra income from showing you advertisements for the next three years for things like credit cards and mortgage offers targeted to your financial situation. 

You have the legal right to say no when TurboTax asks for your permission to &quot;share your data&quot; or use your tax information to &quot;improve your experience....&quot; 
The article complains that granting permission allows TurboTax to share details with &quot;sibling&quot; companies &quot;such as your salary, the amount of your tax refund, whether you received a tax break for student loans and the day you printed your tax return...&quot; 

&quot;You&#x27;ll see that permission request once near the beginning of the tax prep process. If you skip it then, you&#x27;ll see the same screen again near the end. You&#x27;ll have to say yes or no...&quot;
This is part of the corporate arms race for your personal data. Everyone including the grocery store, your apps and the manufacturer of your car are gobbling information to profit from details of your life. With TurboTax, though, you have the power to refuse to participate... 
TurboTax and the online tax prep service from H&amp;R Block have been asking every year to blab your tax return. We&#x27;ve cautioned you about it for each of the past two tax filing seasons. (I focused only on TurboTax this year.)

                              <span>You know how like-charged objects repel — and do so regardless of the sign of their electrical charge? Maybe not always, according to new research published in Nature. 

&quot;We demonstrate experimentally that the solvent plays a hitherto unforeseen but crucial role in interparticle interactions,&quot; they write. But more importantly, &quot;interactions in the fluid phase can break charge-reversal symmetry. 

 We show that in aqueous solution, negatively charged particles can attract at long range while positively charged particles repel. [In solvents like alcohols &quot;that exhibit an inversion of the net molecular dipole at an interface&quot;], positively charged particles may attract whereas negatives repel. 

The observations hold across a wide variety of surface chemistries: from inorganic silica and polymeric particles to polyelectrolyte- and polypeptide-coated surfaces in aqueous solution. 

A theory of interparticle interactions that invokes solvent structuring at an interface captures the observations. Our study establishes a nanoscopic interfacial mechanism by which solvent molecules may give rise to a strong and long-ranged force in solution, with immediate ramifications for a range of particulate and molecular processes across length scales such as self-assembly, gelation and crystallization, biomolecular condensation, coacervation, and phase segregation. 

The delicate interplay of interactions between objects in the fluid phase influences the behaviour, organization and properties of systems from nanometric to more macroscopic size and length scales and thus underpins a wealth of natural phenomena...

A YouTube contractor was addressing the Austin City Council on Thursday, calling on them to urge Google to negotiate with his union, when a colleague interrupted him with jaw-dropping news: His 43-person team of contractors had all been laid off... 

The YouTube workers, who work for Google and Cognizant, unanimously voted to unionize under the Alphabet Workers Union-CWA in April 2023. Since then, the workers say that Google has refused to bargain with them. Thursday&#x27;s layoff signifies continued tensions between Google and its workers, some of whom in 2021 formed a union... 

Workers had about 20 minutes to gather their belongings and leave the premises before they were considered trespassing.

                              <span>In 2005 Gabe Rivera was a compiler software engineer at Intel — before starting the tech-news aggregator Techmeme. And last year his Threads profile added the words &quot;This is a little self-serving, but I want all social networks to be as open as possible.&quot; 

Friday Threads engineer Jesse Chen posted that it was Rivera&#x27;s post when Threads launched asking for an API that &quot;convinced us to go for it.&quot; And Techmeme just made its first post using the API, according to Chen.
The Verge reports :

Threads plans to release its API by the end of June after testing it with a limited set of partners, including Hootsuite, Sprinklr, Sprout Social, Social News Desk, and Techmeme. The API will let developers build third-party apps for Threads and allow sites to publish directly to the platform. 


More from TechCrunch:

 Engineer Jesse Chen posted that the company has been building the API for the past few months. The API currently allows users to authenticate, publish threads and fetch the content they post through these tools. &quot;Over the past few months, we&#x27;ve been building the Threads API to enable creators, developers, and brands to manage their Threads presence at scale and easily share fresh, new ideas with their communities from their favorite third-party applications,&quot; he said... 

The engineer added that Threads is looking to add more capabilities to APIs for moderation and insights gathering.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from MacRumors: Spotify, Epic Games, Deezer, Paddle, and several other developers and EU associations today sent a joint letter to the European Commission to complain about Apple&#x27;s &quot;proposed scheme for compliance&quot; with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The 34 companies and associations do not believe Apple&#x27;s plans &quot;meet the law&#x27;s requirements.&quot; Apple&#x27;s changes &quot;disregard both the spirit and letter of the law&quot; and if left unchanged, will &quot;make a mockery of the DMA,&quot; according to the letter. Several specific components of Apple&#x27;s plan are highlighted, including the Core Technology Fee, the Notarization process, and the terms that developers must accept: 
- Apple&#x27;s requirement to stay with the current App Store terms or opt in to new terms provides developers with &quot;an unworkable choice&quot; that adds complexity and confusion. The letter suggests that neither option is DMA compliant and would &quot;consolidate Apple&#x27;s stronghold over digital markets.&quot;
- The Core Technology Fee and transaction fees will hamper competition and will prevent developers from agreeing to the &quot;unjust terms.&quot;
- Apple is using &quot;unfounded privacy and security concerns&quot; to limit user choice. The &quot;scare screens&quot; that Apple plans to show users will &quot;mislead and degrade the user experience.&quot;
- Apple is not allowing sideloading, and it is making the installation and use of new app stores &quot;difficult, risky and financially unattractive for developers.&quot; 
The companies and associations are urging the European Union to take &quot;swift, timely and decisive action against Apple.&quot; The way the European Commission responds to Apple&#x27;s proposal &quot;will serve as a litmus test of the DMA and whether it can deliver for Europe&#x27;s citizens and economy.&quot; Further reading: Apple Backtracks on Removing EU Home Screen Web Apps in iOS 17.4

                              <span>An upcoming April release of Copilot for OneDrive will be able to find, summarize, and extract information from a wide range of files, including text documents, presentations, spreadsheets, HTML pages and PDF files. &quot;Users can ask Copilot to tailor summaries to their liking, such as only including key points or highlights from a specific section,&quot; reports The Verge. From the report: The chatbot will also be able to respond to natural language prompts and answer highly specific questions about the contents of a user&#x27;s files. Some examples given by Microsoft included asking Copilot to tabulate a week&#x27;s worth of beverage sales and throw the data in a table view by day. Or, asking it to list the pros and cons of a project, or display the most recent or relevant files. Users can even ask Copilot for advice on how to make their documents better. Copilot on OneDrive will also be able to create outlines, tables, and lists for users, based on existing files. A few examples given were:
 
- Using the /sales-enablement.docx as reference, create an outline of a sales pitch to a new customer.

- For these selected resumes, create a table with names, current title, years of experience, educational qualifications, and current location.

- Create a list of frequently asked questions about project Moonshot.

                              <span>The desert planet Arrakis in Frank Herbert&#x27;s science fiction novel Dune is plausible, says Alexander Farnsworth, a climate modeler at the University of Bristol in England. According to Science News, the world would be a harsh place for humans to live, and they probably wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about getting eaten by extraterrestrial helminths. From the report: For their Arrakis climate simulation, which you can explore at the website Climate Archive, Farnsworth and colleagues started with the well-known physics that drive weather and climate on Earth. Using our planet as a starting point makes sense, Farnsworth says, partly because Herbert drew inspiration for Arrakis from &quot;some sort of semi-science of looking at dune systems on the Earth itself.&quot; The team then added nuggets of information a…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from CBS News: Scientists and researchers are celebrating what they call a &quot;dream&quot; discovery after an exploratory drill confirmed a high concentration of helium buried deep in Minnesota&#x27;s Iron Range. Thomas Abraham-James, CEO of Pulsar Helium, said the confirmed presence of helium could be one of the most significant such finds in the world. CBS News Minnesota toured the drill site soon after the drill rig first broke ground at the beginning of February. The discovery happened more than three weeks later at about 2 a.m. Thursday, as a drill reached its depth of 2,200 feet below the surface. According to Abraham-James, the helium concentration was measured at 12.4%, which is higher than forecasted and roughly 30 times the industry standard for commercial helium. &quot;12.4% is just a dream. It&#x27;s perfect,&quot; he said.
 
Now that helium is confirmed to be underground in Babbitt, Abraham-James said the next phase of the project is a feasibility study by an independent third party to study the size of the well and whether it could support a full-service helium plant. &quot;It&#x27;s not just about drilling one hole, but now proving up the geological models, being able to get some really good data that wasn&#x27;t captured in the original discovery,&quot; he explained. &quot;It has the potential to really contribute to local society.&quot; The company said the feasibility study could take until the end of the year to complete.

                              <span>Since implementing a remote-first policy in 2021, Yelp says it&#x27;s experienced a surge in job applications and a more satisfied workforce. Fortune reports: Last year, the total number of job applicants was 43% higher compared to 2021, according to Yelp&#x27;s 2024 Remote Work Report released earlier this month. The number of applicants for sales roles skyrocketed by 103%, and prospects for its general and administrative (G&amp;A) positions shot up 52% over the same time period. Those increases fall in line with data that shows a tidal wave of applicants clamoring for remote jobs. &quot;It&#x27;s rewarding to see both the level of interest and the quality of our applicants,&quot; Carmen Amara, chief people officer at Yelp, told Fortune. &quot;Remote work has allowed us to attract a number of candidates who previously would not have applied to Yelp due to their location.&quot;
 
Despite arguments that remote work weakens workers&#x27; connections and growth opportunities, Yelp says it has found the opposite to be true. About 90% of the company&#x27;s more than 4,700 employees say they have found effective ways to collaborate remotely, and 91% say they are confident in upward career mobility while working out of the office. Flexible schedules have also facilitated a healthy work-life balance -- about 89% of the company&#x27;s workers say they can manage personal and professional demands, and the same amount say that the remote model has allowed them to make positive changes for their wellbeing.
 
Notably, Yelp&#x27;s global tenure has increased to 3.5 years in 2023, compared to 2.8 years the year prior. The company says it&#x27;s using the money it saved from shutting down its underutilized offices in New York City, Chicago, and Washington D.C., to funnel back into employee benefits, professional development, and wellness reimbursements.

                              <span>Emma Roth reports via The Verge: If you still haven&#x27;t migrated your Oculus account to a Meta one, you might want to do that soon. In an email sent to users, the company says it will delete Oculus accounts on March 29th, 2024, preventing you from reactivating or retrieving your apps, in-app purchases, store credits, and more. You&#x27;ll lose your achievements, friends list, and any content created with your Oculus account if you don&#x27;t migrate to a Meta account before then.
 
Oculus accounts have been on the way out since 2020, when the company then known as Facebook started requiring new users to sign up with Facebook accounts instead. However, it added the ability to create a Meta account in 2022, offering an alternative to users who didn&#x27;t want to link their Facebook account to their Quest headset. Meta stopped letting users log in to their Oculus accounts in January 2023. If you&#x27;ve got a Quest gathering dust in a drawer somewhere, now&#x27;s your last chance to migrate your Oculus account to a Meta one.
 
You can migrate your account by heading to this page and signing up for a Meta account with the same email you&#x27;ve used for Oculus. From there, you&#x27;ll be able to access all of the same games, data, and other purchases saved to your Oculus account.

Reuters reports: Waymo, which already operates in San Francisco and Phoenix, applied on Jan 19 to expand its driverless services, saying it would work with policymakers, first responders and community organizations. Last month, the CPUC suspended the application &quot;for further staff review.&quot; &quot;Waymo may begin fared driverless passenger service operations in the specified areas of Los Angeles and the San Francisco Peninsula, effective today,&quot; the regulator said on a notice posted to its website Friday.

Despite minor disagreements, the US Roads Project mostly worked in harmony, but recently, a long-simmering debate over the website&#x27;s rules drove this community to the brink. Efforts at compromise fell apart. There was a schism, and in the fall of 2023, the editors packed up their articles and moved over to a website dedicated to roads and roads alone. It&#x27;s called AARoads, a promised land where the editors hope, at last, that they can find peace. &quot;Roads are a background piece.

But I&#x27;m actually glad Apple gave me the final push to venture outside the walled garden for a longer stroll, because the expedition has been a delight.
 And now that Apple has done a complete 180 on PWAs in the EU – they&#x27;re not going anywhere, the company announced today – I&#x27;m even happier with the way it all worked out.

                              <span>Paul Kunert writes in an exclusive report for The Register: IBM is asking staff who want to take voluntary redundancy to raise their hand as it embarks on a new round of global job cuts, though roles in Europe and within a handful of departments are expected to shoulder the brunt. The Resource Action, as Big Blue likes to euphemistically refer to layoffs, shouldn&#x27;t be a massive surprise to anyone with more than a passing interest in IBM as it was signaled last month in a Q4 earnings call. Insiders told us this latest process is not considered to be financial but &quot;transformative,&quot; although IBM was quite clear in January when CFO James Kavanaugh discussed achieving &quot;$3 billion annual run rate in savings by the end of 2024.&quot; This is a third bigger than the initial ambition. The Reg understands that 80 percent of the reduction target is aimed at Enterprise Operations &amp; Support (EO&amp;S) and Q2C missions, Finance &amp; Operations (including Procurement, CIO, HR, Marketing &amp; Comms and Global Real Estate).
 
The European Works Council, one IBMer told us, has informed staff that circa 50 percent of IBM&#x27;s reduction goal will impact staffing levels across the European continent. As if often the preferred route, IBM is seeking employees that are happy to take voluntary redundancy, rather than ditching someone that doesn&#x27;t want to leave. The sources we spoke to did not reveal the total population in scope for redundancies or the numbers of volunteers being sought. IBM did not confirm the numbers either. [...] Slovakia, we&#x27;re told, is to feel the tightest squeeze with around a third of IBM&#x27;s cuts in Europe landing on its International (shared services) Center in Bratislava; the Center in Hungary that supports EO&amp;S/ Q2C, as well as the Finance function in Bulgaria are also going to absorb what our sources described as the most dramatic staff reductions.

                              <span>The Supreme Court of Canada ruled today that police must now have a warrant or court order to obtain a person or organization&#x27;s IP address. CBC News reports: The top court was asked to consider whether an IP address alone, without any of the personal information attached to it, was protected by an expectation of privacy under the Charter. In a five-four split decision, the court said a reasonable expectation of privacy is attached to the numbers making up a person&#x27;s IP address, and just getting those numbers alone constitutes a search. Writing for the majority, Justice Andromache Karakatsanis wrote that an IP address is &quot;the crucial link between an internet user and their online activity.&quot; &quot;Thus, the subject matter of this search was the information these IP addresses could reveal about sp…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: A technology company that routes millions of SMS text messages across the world has secured an exposed database that was spilling one-time security codes that may have granted users&#x27; access to their Facebook, Google and TikTok accounts. The Asian technology and internet company YX International manufactures cellular networking equipment and provides SMS text message routing services. SMS routing helps to get time-critical text messages to their proper destination across various regional cell networks and providers, such as a user receiving an SMS security code or link for logging in to online services. YX International claims to send 5 million SMS text messages daily. But the technology company left one of its internal databases exposed to the internet without a password, allowing anyone to access the sensitive data inside using only a web browser, just with knowledge of the database&#x27;s public IP address.
 
Anurag Sen, a good-faith security researcher and expert in discovering sensitive but inadvertently exposed datasets leaking to the internet, found the database. Sen said it was not apparent who the database belonged to, nor who to report the leak to, so Sen shared details of the exposed database with TechCrunch to help identify its owner and report the security lapse. Sen told TechCrunch that the exposed database included the contents of text messages sent to users, including one-time passcodes and password reset links for some of the world&#x27;s largest tech and online companies, including Facebook and WhatsApp, Google, TikTok, and others. The database had monthly logs dating back to July 2023 and was growing in size by the minute. In the exposed database, TechCrunch found sets of internal email addresses and corresponding passwords associated with YX International, and alerted the company to the spilling database. The database went offline a short time later.

The Overflow API is designed to act as a knowledge database to help developers build more accurate and helpful code-generation models. Google announced it was using the service to access relevant information from Stack Overflow via the API and integrate the data with its latest Gemini models, and for its cloud storage console.

                              <span>Rates of obesity in the U.S. and around the world have more than doubled over the past three decades, according to a new study in The Lancet. From a report: More than 1 billion people worldwide now have obesity, a sign of worsening nutrition that&#x27;s also raising the risk of leading causes of death and disease such as high blood pressure, cancer and diabetes. The global rate of obesity more than doubled among women, from 8.8% to 18.5%, and nearly tripled in men, from 4.8% to 14.0%, between 1990 and 2022, according to research that pulls from over 3,600 studies. 

The obesity rate among children and adolescents increased by roughly four times, from 1.7% to 6.9% in girls and 2.1% to 9.3% in boys. Just over 4 in 10 adults and 2 in 5 kids in the U.S. are obese. The U.S. now has the world&#x27;s 10th-highest male obesity rate and 36th-highest female obesity rate. In 1990, the U.S. had the world&#x27;s 17th-highest male obesity rate and the 41st-highest female obesity rate.

                              <span>Energy-related emissions of carbon dioxide hit a record high in 2023, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in a report on Friday. The IEA analysis showed that it rose by 410 million tonnes, or 1.1%, in 2023 to 37.4 billion tonnes. From a report: &quot;Far from falling rapidly -- as is required to meet the global climate goals set out in the Paris Agreement -- CO2 emissions reached a new record high,&quot; the IEA said. However, the Paris-based watchdog also found clean energy including wind and solar energy, as well as electric vehicles, had helped to offset the impact of the continued burning of coal and oil growth, which was 1.3% in 2022. 

The reopening of China&#x27;s economy after the COVID-19 pandemic and a recovery in the aviation sector contributed to an overall rise, the IEA said in its report. Severe droughts last year in China, the United States, India, and other countries hampered hydropower production. It accounted for around 40% of the rise in emissions or 170 million tonnes of CO2. &quot;Without this effect, emissions from the global electricity sector would have fallen in 2023,&quot; the IEA said. Carbon dioxide emissions from coal accounted for the remaining increase. The IEA analysis showed that 2023 was the first year in which at least half of electricity generation in industrialized countries came from low-emission sources such as renewable energy and nuclear power. Energy-related emissions in the United States fell by 4.1%, and 9% in the European Union, driven by a surge in renewable power generation.

Pitchbook: On the phone with a founder who recently wound down his seed-stage software startup, I asked him what his plan was next. Having laid off all of his employees in autumn of last year, he was the last man standing: tasked with the thankless job of shutting down the company, returning capital, and dealing with tax documents. To handle the bureaucracy, the founder used Sunset, one of the companies that sprung up last year to respond to the burgeoning industry of failed startups. 

In a sign of the times, such wind-down startups are growing rapidly. Sunset saw 9x quarter-over-quarter revenue growth and a 65% monthly customer growth rate between November 2023 and January 2024. Competitor …</span>

                              <span>Nikon is working with NASA to make a mirrorless camera that astronauts will use during the agency&#x27;s incoming Artemis III mission to document their return to the Moon. From a report: On Thursday, NASA announced that it had entered a Space Act agreement with Nikon to develop the Handheld Universal Lunar Camera (HULC), a camera system designed to capture imagery in low light and survive the harsh lunar environment. The crewed Artemis III mission -- which will launch &quot;no earlier than September 2026&quot; -- aims to explore the lunar south pole, a region of the Moon that contains water ice within permanently shadowed craters. 

That makes it an area of scientific interest, but the extreme lighting and temperature conditions pose particular technical challenges for operating equipment within the lunar south pole region. Nikon&#x27;s full-frame Z9 flagship has already been used in thermal, vacuum, and radiation testing before the agreement, with a modified version of the camera forming the base of the HULC system alongside Nikkor lenses. The HULC design also implements thermal blankets designed by NASA to protect the camera from dust and extreme temperatures and modified electrical components to minimize potential issues caused by radiation. A custom grip with modified buttons has been used to make it easier for suited crew members to operate the camera system while wearing gloves.

                              <span>Russian space officials have acknowledged a continuing air leak from the Russian segment of the International Space Station, but said it poses no danger to its crew. From a report: The Roscosmos state corporation said that specialists were monitoring the leak and the crew &quot;regularly conducts work to locate and fix possible spots of the leak.&quot; It said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies: &quot;There is no threat to the crew or the station itself.&quot; Joel Montalbano, Nasa&#x27;s station project manager, had noted on Wednesday that the leak in the Russian segment has increased but emphasised that it remained small and posed no threat to the crew&#x27;s safety or vehicle operations. 

As the space outpost is ageing, the crew has to spend more time to repair and maintain it, Roscosmos said. Russian space officials first reported a leak in the Zvezda module in August 2020 and later that year Russian crew members located what they believed was its source and tried to fix it. In November 2021, another potentially leaky spot was found in a different part of the Russian section of the station. Roscosmos and Nasa have said the leak posed no danger to the crew and did not affect operations on the station. There have been other glitches. In October, coolant leaked from an external backup radiator for Russia&#x27;s new science lab, Nauka, although its main thermal control system was working normally and space officials said the crew and the station were not in danger.

                              <span>Apple is reversing its previous decision to remove support for Home Screen web apps in iOS 17.4 for EU users. Apple&#x27;s statement: Previously, Apple announced plans to remove the Home Screen web apps capability in the EU as part of our efforts to comply with the DMA. The need to remove the capability was informed by the complex security and privacy concerns associated with web apps to support alternative browser engines that would require building a new integration architecture that does not currently exist in iOS. 

We have received requests to continue to offer support for Home Screen web apps in iOS, therefore we will continue to offer the existing Home Screen web apps capability in the EU. This support means Home Screen web apps continue to be built directly on WebKit and its security architecture, and align with the security and privacy model for native apps on iOS. 

Developers and users who may have been impacted by the removal of Home Screen web apps in the beta release of iOS in the EU can expect the return of the existing functionality for Home Screen web apps with the availability of iOS 17.4 in early March.

                              <span>HP launched a subscription service this week that rents people a printer, allots them a specific amount of printed pages, and sends them ink for a monthly fee. From a report: HP is framing its service as a way to simplify printing for families and small businesses, but the deal also comes with monitoring and a years-long commitment. Prices range from $6.99 per month for a plan that includes an HP Envy printer (the current model is the 6020e) and 20 printed pages. The priciest plan includes an HP OfficeJet Pro rental and 700 printed pages for $35.99 per month. 

HP says it will provide subscribers with ink deliveries when they&#x27;re running low and 24/7 support via phone or chat (although it&#x27;s dubious how much you want to rely on HP support). Support doesn&#x27;t include on or offsite repairs or part replacements. The subscription&#x27;s terms of service (TOS) note that the service doesn&#x27;t cover damage or failure caused by, unsurprisingly, &quot;use of non-HP media supplies and other products&quot; or if you use your printer more than what your plan calls for. HP calls this an All-In-Plan; if you subscribe, the tech company will be all in on your printing activities. One of the most perturbing aspects of the subscription plan is that it requires subscribers to keep their printers connected to the Internet. HP seeks two-year subscriber commitments, charging up to $270 plus taxes if canceled early.

From a report: Under the Digital Markets Act, from March 7 Apple will be required to offer alternative app stores on iPhones and allow developers to opt out of using its in-app payment system, which charges fees of up to 30%. The U.S. tech giant, which on Jan. 24 detailed the changes to bring its App Store in line with the EU rules, said &quot;sideloading&quot; has sparked concerns from both EU and non-EU government agencies and users.

                              <span>Google is cracking down on rooted Android devices, blocking multiple people from using the RCS message feature in Google Messages. From a report: Users with rooted phones -- a process that unlocks privileged access to the Android operating system, like jailbreaking iPhones -- have made several reports on the Google Messages support page, Reddit, and XDA&#x27;s web forum over the last few months, finding they&#x27;re suddenly unable to send or receive RCS messages. One example from Reddit user u/joefuf shows that RCS messages would simply vanish after hitting the send button. Several reports also mention that Google Messages gave no indication that RCS chat was no longer working, and was still showing as connected and working in Google Messages. In a statement sent to the Verge where we asked if Google is blocking rooted devices from using RCS, Google communications manager Ivy Hunt said the company is &quot;ensuring that message-issuing/receiving devices are following the operating measures defined by the RCS standard&quot; in a bid to prevent spam and abuse on Google Messages. In other words, yes, Google is blocking RCS on rooted devices.

                              <span>According to the Washington Post (paywalled), the FBI is using mobile push notification data to unmask people suspected of serious crimes, such as pedophilia, terrorism, and murder. Gizmodo reports: The Post did a little digging into court records and found evidence of at least 130 search warrants filed by the feds for push notification data in cases spanning 14 states. In those cases, FBI officials asked tech companies like Google, Apple, and Facebook to fork over data related to a suspect&#x27;s mobile notifications, then used the data to implicate the suspect in criminal behavior linked to a particular app, even though many of those apps were supposedly anonymous communication platforms, like Wickr.
 
How exactly is this possible? Push notifications, which are provided by a mobile operating system provider, include embedded metadata that can be examined to understand the use of the mobile apps on a particular phone. Apps come laced with a quiet identifier, a &quot;push token,&quot; which is stored on the corporate servers of a company like Apple or another phone manufacturer after a user signs up to use a particular app. Those tokens can later be used to identify the person using the app, based on the information associated with the device on which the app was downloaded. Even turning off push notifications on your device doesn&#x27;t necessarily disable this feature, experts contend. [...]
 
If finding new ways to catch pedophiles and terrorists doesn&#x27;t seem like the worst thing in the world, the Post article highlights the voices of critics who fear that this kind of mobile data could be used to track people who have not committed serious crimes -- like political activists or women seeking abortions in states where the procedure has been restricted.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Today is Leap Day, meaning that for the first time in four years, it&#x27;s February 29. That&#x27;s normally a quirky, astronomical factoid (or a very special birthday for some). But that unique calendar date broke gas station payment systems across New Zealand for much of the day. As reported by numerous international outlets, self-serve pumps in New Zealand were unable to accept card payments due to a problem with the gas pumps&#x27; payment processing software. The New Zealand Herald reported that the outage lasted &quot;more than 10 hours.&quot; This effectively shuttered some gas stations, while others had to rely on in-store payments. The outage affected suppliers, including Allied Petroleum, BP, Gull, Waitomo, and Z Energy, and has reportedly been fixed. In-house payment solutions, such as BP fuel cards and the Waitomo app, reportedly still worked during the outage. A representative for Petroleum, when prompted via Facebook to &quot;maybe remember Leap Day in four years&#x27; time,&quot; responded: &quot;We&#x27;ll add it to our Outlook reminders :(&quot;

                              <span>Starting today, Ford electric vehicle owners can use one of Tesla&#x27;s 2,400+ superchargers, but there&#x27;s a hitch. &quot;They&#x27;ll need to get an adapter that Ford will provide for free, although the company won&#x27;t start shipping those until the end of March,&quot; notes the Associated Press. Product Reviewer MKBHD also notes that non-Teslas will need to park in a spot that blocks 2 spots where a Tesla would take up one. &quot;If the charge station fills up the remaining spots with Teslas, the app will show 1 charger as available but the parking spot is blocked by the Mach-E,&quot; adds MKBHD. From the report: Last May, Ford became the first automaker to reach an agreement with the Austin, Texas-based Tesla to charge on its network, which is the largest and most well-placed in the U.S. Tesla has more than 26,000 plugs and nearly 2,400 Supercharger stations across the U.S. and Canada. Ford said its owners will have access to about 15,000 Tesla fast-charging plugs that are located strategically along travel corridors. Ford owners won&#x27;t be able to use some older Tesla plugs.
 
Most other automakers followed Ford in joining Tesla&#x27;s network and agreeing to switch to Tesla&#x27;s plug, called the North American Charging Standard, which is smaller and easier to use than the current plugs on most other EVs sold in the two countries. Ford said adding the Tesla plugs will double the size of the network that can be used by Ford EV owners. There are nearly 166,000 Ford EVs in the U.S.
 
Ford is offering the adapters for free to the owners, who can sign up on the Ford.com website to reserve them between Thursday and June 30. The company will provide one free adapter per vehicle. Tesla&#x27;s network was turned on Wednesday morning, and software enabling the Ford vehicles to charge at Tesla stations was to be sent out around the same time. Ford will switch to Tesla&#x27;s charging connector with its second-generation EVs starting next year.

                              <span>A B.C. lawyer has been ordered to pay costs for opposing counsel for the time they took to discover that two cases she cited as precedent were created by ChatGPT. CBC News reports: The cases would have provided compelling precedent for a divorced dad to take his children to China -- had they been real. But instead of savouring courtroom victory, the Vancouver lawyer for a millionaire embroiled in an acrimonious split has been told to personally compensate her client&#x27;s ex-wife&#x27;s lawyers for the time it took them to learn the cases she hoped to cite were conjured up by ChatGPT. In a decision released Monday, a B.C. Supreme Court judge reprimanded lawyer Chong Ke for including two AI &quot;hallucinations&quot; in an application filed last December. The cases never made it into Ke&#x27;s arguments; they were withdrawn once she learned they were non-existent.
 
Justice David Masuhara said he didn&#x27;t think the lawyer intended to deceive the court -- but he was troubled all the same. &quot;As this case has unfortunately made clear, generative AI is still no substitute for the professional expertise that the justice system requires of lawyers,&quot; Masuhara wrote in a &quot;final comment&quot; appended to his ruling. &quot;Competence in the selection and use of any technology tools, including those powered by AI, is critical.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Video doorbell cameras have been commoditized to the point where they&#x27;re available for $30-$40 on marketplaces like Amazon, Walmart, Temu, and Shein. The true cost of owning one might be much greater, however. Consumer Reports (CR) has released the findings of a security investigation into two budget-minded doorbell brands, Eken and Tuck, which are largely the same hardware produced by the Eken Group in China, according to CR. The cameras are further resold under at least 10 more brands. The cameras are set up through a common mobile app, Aiwit. And the cameras share something else, CR claims: &quot;troubling security vulnerabilities.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Google is introducing improvements to search suggestions in Chrome, the company announced today. As part of the changes, users will start to get more helpful search suggestions in Chrome based on what others are searching for, see more images for suggested searches and find search suggestions even with a poor connection. 

Search suggestions are the drop-down list of suggested completions that appear before you finish typing out your query in Google. The feature generates predictions to help users save time and speed up their search. With these new updates, Google is expanding the availability of search suggestions and using them to boost inspiration. When users are signed into Chrome on desktop and open a new tab, they will now start to see suggestions in the search box related to their previous searches based on what other people are searching for.

                              <span>Several internet-connected doorbell cameras have a security flaw that allows hackers to take over the camera by just holding down a button, among other issues, according to research by Consumer Reports. From a report: On Thursday, the non-profit Consumer Reports published research that detailed four security and privacy flaws in cameras made by EKEN, a company based in Shenzhen, China, which makes cameras branded as EKEN, but also, apparently, Tuck and other brands. These relatively cheap doorbell cameras were available on online marketplaces like Walmart and Temu, which removed them from sale after Consumer Reports reached out to the companies to flag the problems. These doorbell cameras are, however, still available elsewhere. 

According to Consumer Reports, the most impactful issue is that if someone is in close proximity to a EKEN doorbell camera, they can take &quot;full control&quot; of it by simply downloading its official app -- called Aiwit -- and putting the camera in pairing mode by simply holding down the doorbell&#x27;s button for eight seconds. Aiwit&#x27;s app has more than a million downloads on Google Play, suggesting it is widely used. At that point, the malicious user can create their own account on the app, scan the QR code generated by the app by putting it in front of the doorbell&#x27;s camera.

                              <span>Rockstar Games, a division of Take-Two Interactive Software, will ask employees to return to the office five days a week beginning in April as the video-game maker enters the final stages of development on its next game, the hotly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI. Bloomberg: In an email to staff on Wednesday reviewed by Bloomberg, Rockstar Head of Publishing Jenn Kolbe said the decision was made for productivity and security reasons. The company has faced several security breaches including a massive dump of early footage from the new Grand Theft Auto and an early trailer that leaked in December. Kolbe wrote that the company also found &quot;tangible benefits&quot; from in-person work. &quot;Making these changes now puts us in the best position to deliver the next Grand Theft Auto at the level of quality and polish we know it requires, along with a publishing roadmap that matches the scale and ambition of the game,&quot; she wrote.

                              <span>Apple plans to disclose more about its plans to put generative AI to use later this year, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said during the company&#x27;s annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday. From a report: Cook said that the iPhone maker sees &quot;incredible breakthrough potential for generative AI, which is why we&#x27;re currently investing significantly in this area. We believe that will unlock transformative opportunities for users when it comes to productivity, problem solving and more.&quot; 

Apple has been slower in rolling out generative AI, which can generate human-like responses to written prompts, than rivals such as Microsoftand Alphabet&#x27;s Google, which are weaving them into products. On Wednesday, Cook argued that AI is already at work behind the scenes in Apple&#x27;s products but said there would be more news on explicit AI features later this year. Bloomberg previously reported Apple plans to use AI to improve the ability to search through data stored on Apple devices. &quot;Every Mac that is powered by Apple silicon is an extraordinarily capable AI machine. In fact, there&#x27;s no better computer for AI on the market today,&quot; Cook said.

                              <span>Microsoft has outlined a new Windows API designed to offer a seamless way for game developers to integrate super resolution AI-upscaling features from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel. From a report: In a new blog post, program manager Joshua Tucker describes Microsoft&#x27;s new DirectSR API as the &quot;missing link&quot; between games and super resolution technologies, and says it should provide &quot;a smoother, more efficient experience that scales across hardware.&quot; 

&quot;This API enables multi-vendor SR [super resolution] through a common set of inputs and outputs, allowing a single code path to activate a variety of solutions including Nvidia DLSS Super Resolution, AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution, and Intel XeSS,&quot; the post reads. The pitch seems to be that developers will be able to support this DirectSR API, rather than having to write code for each and every upscaling technology. 

The blog post comes a couple of weeks after an &quot;Automatic Super Resolution&quot; feature was spotted in a test version of Windows 11, which promised to &quot;use AI to make supported games play more smoothly with enhanced details.&quot; Now, it seems the feature will plug into existing super resolution technologies like DLSS, FSR, and XeSS rather than offering a Windows-level alternative.

                              <span>Eating ultraprocessed foods raises the risk of developing or dying from dozens of adverse health conditions, according to a new review of 45 meta-analyses on almost 10 million people. From a report: &quot;We found consistent evidence linking higher intakes of ultra-processed foods with over 70% of the 45 different health outcomes we assessed,&quot; said senior author Wolfgang Marx, a senior research fellow at the Food &amp; Mood Centre at Deakin University in Geelong, Australia, in an email. A higher intake was considered about one serving or about 10% more ultraprocessed foods per day, said Heinz Freisling, a scientist in the nutrition and metabolism branch of the World Health Organization&#x27;s International Agency for Research on Cancer, in an email. 

&quot;This proportion can be regarded as &#x27;baseline&#x27; and for people consuming more than this baseline, the risk might increase,&quot; said Freisling, who was not involved in the study. Researchers graded each study as having credible or strong, highly suggestive, suggestive, weak or no evidence. All the studies in the review were published in the past three years, and none was funded by companies involved in the production of ultraprocessed foods, the authors said. &quot;Strong evidence shows that a higher intake of ultra-processed foods was associated with approximately 50% higher risk of cardiovascular disease-related death and common mental disorders,&quot; said lead author Dr. Melissa Lane, a postdoctoral research fellow at Deakin, in an email. Cardiovascular disease encompasses heart attacks, stroke, clogged arteries and peripheral artery disease.

                              <span>Angie Byron, a long-time member of the Drupal community, offers guidance on avoiding common mistakes and general good-practices for those new to contributing to open-source projects: [...] You might not know it yet, but as a newcomer to an open source project, you have this AMAZING superpower: you are often-times the only one in that whole project capable of reading the documentation through new eyes. Because I can guarantee, the people who wrote that documentation are not new. :-) 

So take time to read the docs and file issues (or better yet, pull requests) for anything that was unclear. This lets you get a &quot;feel&quot; for contributing in a project/community without needing to go way down the deep end of learning coding standards and unit tests and commit signing and whatever other bananas things they&#x27;re about to make you do. :) Also, people are more likely to take time to help you, if you&#x27;ve helped them first!

                              <span>Journalist Eric Newcomer, writing at The Free Press: There was a time when I believed that self-driving cars should be held to the standard of airplanes. Every mistake needed to be rigorously understood and any human death was unforgivable. But my view has evolved over time as human drivers have continued to kill tens of thousands of people a year. We need a solution that&#x27;s meaningfully better than human drivers, yes, but we shouldn&#x27;t wait for perfection before we start getting dangerous human drivers off the streets. 

Lost in all the fulminating about automation and big-tech tyranny is the fact that self-driving cars are an attempt to solve a very serious problem. Traffic fatalities are a leading cause of death in the United States for anyone between the ages of 1 and 54. About 40,000 pe…</span>

                              <span>Citing potential national security risks, the Biden administration says it will investigate Chinese-made &quot;smart cars&quot; that can gather sensitive information about Americans driving them. From a report: The probe could lead to new regulations aimed at preventing China from using sophisticated technology in electric cars and other so-called connected vehicles to track drivers and their personal information. Officials are concerned that features such as driver assistance technology could be used to effectively spy on Americans. 

While the action stops short of a ban on Chinese imports, President Joe Biden said he is taking unprecedented steps to safeguard Americans&#x27; data. &quot;China is determined to dominate the future of the auto market, including by using unfair practices,&quot; Biden said in a statement Thursday. &quot;China&#x27;s policies could flood our market with its vehicles, posing risks to our national security. I&#x27;m not going to let that happen on my watch.&quot; Biden and other officials noted that China has imposed wide-ranging restrictions on American autos and other foreign vehicles. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said connected cars &quot;are like smart phones on wheels&quot; and pose a serious national security risk.

 See, every Mac with a screen has since 2018 shipped with a retina-class display. That means a pixel-per-inch count in excess of 218. High enough that you can&#x27;t see the individual pixels with the naked eye. With a high-resolution display like that, you can run it at 2x or 200%. So a 27&quot; 5K Apple Studio Display (218 PPI) that runs natively at 5120x2880 can run at 2x  and give you the equivalent of a 2560x1440 workspace, but with much nicer rendering. And that&#x27;s the magic. That 2x/200%. That&#x27;s why fonts on the Mac look so good out o…</span>

                              <span>As part of its IPO filing with the SEC, Reddit disclosed that it has invested some of its excess cash in bitcoin, ether and Polygon. From a report: Based on the document, the firm now holds BTC and ETH in its balance sheet. Notably, Reddit filing came as part of the IPO registration statement with the SEC. Apart from ETH and BTC, the filing revealed Reddit&#x27;s investment in Polygon (MATIC). According to the document, the social media platform plans to use both Ether and Polygon as a form of payment for digital goods. Further, Reddit noted that the amount of Polygon and Ethereum from virtual goods is currently immaterial. However, it indicated the possibility of a continuous addition of Bitcoin and Ethereum to its treasury. Also, it plans to keep trying out its passion for virtual goods. Moreover, the document revealed that Reddit made the investments using some of its excess cash reserves. However, the firm didn&#x27;t disclose details of the crypto investments it made.
 
Reddit&#x27;s filing document revealed why the popular social media platform dabbled into crypto. According to the firm, it holds Bitcoin and Ethereum to enable its engineering and product teams to use them. Further, it cited the present regulatory stance that suggests these two assets are potentially non-securities under US laws. Also, Reddit disclosed its plans to expand its crypto holding by including other digital assets in its balance sheet. However, it highlighted that such a move will depend on future regulations that exempt crypto as a security.

                              <span>&quot;Today, the KDE Community is announcing a new major release of Plasma 6.0 and Gear 24.02,&quot; writes longtime Slashdot reader jrepin. &quot;The new version brings new windows and desktop overview effects, improved color management, a cleaner theme, better overall performance, and much more.&quot; From the announcement: KDE Plasma is a modern, feature-rich desktop environment for Linux-based operating systems. Known for its sleek design, customizable interface, and extensive set of applications, it is also open source, devoid of ads, and makes protecting your privacy and personal data a priority.
 
With Plasma 6, the technology stack has undergone two major upgrades: a transition to the latest version of the application framework, Qt 6, and a migration to the modern Linux graphics platform, Wayland. We will continue providing support for the legacy X11 session for users who prefer to stick with it for now. [...] KDE Gear 24.02 brings many applications to Qt 6. In addition to the changes in Breeze, many applications adopted a more frameless look for their interface.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Convicted FTX fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried pleaded for a lenient prison sentence in a court filing yesterday, saying that he isn&#x27;t motivated by greed and &quot;is already being punished.&quot; Bankman-Fried requested a sentence of 63 to 78 months, or 5.25 to 6.5 years. Because of &quot;Sam&#x27;s charitable works and demonstrated commitment to others, a sentence that returns Sam promptly to a productive role in society would be sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes of sentencing,&quot; the court filing (PDF) said. Bankman-Fried&#x27;s filing also said that he maintains his innocence and intends to appeal his convictions.
 
A presentence investigation report (PSR) prepared by a probation officer recommended that Bankman-Fried be sentenced to 100 years in prison, according to the filing. &quot;That recommendation is grotesque,&quot; SBF&#x27;s filing said, arguing that it is based on an erroneously calculated loss of $10 billion. The $10 billion loss asserted in the PSR is &quot;illusory&quot; because the &quot;victims are poised to recover -- were always poised to recover -- a hundred cents on the dollar&quot; in bankruptcy proceedings, SBF&#x27;s filing said. The filing urged the court to &quot;reject the PSR&#x27;s barbaric proposal&quot; of 100 years, saying that such sentences should only be for &quot;heinous conduct&quot; like terrorism and child sexual abuse.
 
The founder and ex-CEO of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, Bankman-Fried was convicted on seven charges with a combined maximum sentence of 110 years after a monthlong trial in US District Court for the Southern District of New York. The charges included wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, securities fraud, commodities fraud, and money laundering. US government prosecutors are required to make a sentencing recommendation by March 15, and US District Judge Lewis Kaplan is scheduled to issue a sentence on March 28.

                              <span>EU lawmakers on Wednesday approved draft rules governing patents key to technologies for telecom equipment and connected cars in the face of criticism from Nokia, Ericsson and other patent holders. From a report: The draft rules proposed by the European Commission in April last year seek to end costly and lengthy litigation over patents used in technologies for telecom equipment, mobile phones, computers, connected cars and smart devices. The European Parliament will now have to thrash out the details of the proposed rules with EU countries before it can become law. Nokia, Ericsson and Siemens in a letter to EU lawmakers in January, highlighted concerns from the European Patent Office, standard-setting body ETSI and other bodies on the draft rules. Lobbying group IP Europe, which counts Nokia, Ericsson and Qualcomm as its members, reiterated its opposition to the draft rules. &quot;The beneficiaries would not be SMEs as claimed but big tech,&quot; IP Europe&#x27;s managing director Patrick McCutcheon said ahead of the lawmakers&#x27; vote.

                              <span>San Francisco will vote next week on a divisive ballot measure that would authorize police to use surveillance cameras, drones and AI-powered facial recognition as the city struggles to restore a reputation tarnished by street crime and drugs. From a report: The Safer San Francisco initiative, formally called Proposition E, is championed by Mayor London Breed who believes disgruntled citizens will approve the proposal on Tuesday. Although technology fueled the Silicon Valley-adjacent city&#x27;s decades-long boom, residents have a history of being deeply suspicious. In 2019, San Francisco, known for its progressive politics, became the first large U.S. city to ban government use of facial recognition due to concerns about privacy and misuse. 

Breed, who is running for re-election in November, played down the potential for abuse under the ballot measure, saying safeguards are in place. &quot;I get that people are concerned about privacy rights and other things, but technology is all around us,&quot; she said in an interview. &quot;It&#x27;s coming whether we want it to or not. And everyone is walking around with AI in their hands with their phones, recording, videotaping,&quot; Breed said. Critics of the proposal contend it could hurt disadvantaged communities and lead to false arrests, arguing surveillance technology requires greater oversight.

From a report: The move marks a rare policy effort to address a longstanding US national security concern: the ease with which anyone, including a foreign intelligence services, can legally buy Americans&#x27; data and then use the information for espionage, hacking and blackmail. The issue, a senior Justice Department official told reporters this week, is a &quot;growing threat to our national security.&quot; 

The executive order will give the Justice Department the authority to regulate commercial transactions that &quot;pose an unacceptable risk&quot; to national security by, for example, giving a foreign power large-scale access to Americans&#x27; personal data, the Justice Department official said. The department will also issue regulations that require better protection of sensitive government information, including geolocation data on US military members, according to US officials. A lot of the online trade in personal information runs through so-called data brokers, which buy information on people&#x27;s Social Security numbers, names, addresses, income, employment history and criminal background, as well as other items. 

&quot;Countries of concern, such as China and Russia, are buying Americans&#x27; sensitive personal data from data brokers,&quot; a separate senior administration official told reporters. In addition to health and location data, the executive order is expected to cover other sensitive information like genomic and financial data. Administration officials told reporters the new executive order would be applied narrowly so as not to hurt business transactions that do not pose a national security risk.

                              <span>Over the past four centuries quadrillions of ants have created a strange and turbulent global society that shadows our own. An excerpt from an Aeon article: In their native ranges, these multi-nest colonies can grow to a few hundred metres across, limited by physical barriers or other ant colonies. This turns the landscape to a patchwork of separate groups, with each chemically distinct society fighting or avoiding others at their borders. Species and colonies coexist, without any prevailing over the others. However, for the &#x27;anonymous societies&#x27; of unicolonial ants, as they&#x27;re known, transporting a small number of queens and workers to a new place can cause the relatively stable arrangement of groups to break down. As new nests are created, colonies bud and spread without ever drawing boundaries because workers treat all others of their own kind as allies. What was once a patchwork of complex relationships becomes a simplified, and unified, social system. The relative genetic homogeneity of the small founder population, replicated across a growing network of nests, ensures that members of unicolonial species tolerate each other. Spared the cost of fighting one another, these ants can live in denser populations, spreading across the land as a plant might, and turning their energies to capturing food and competing with other species. Chemical badges keep unicolonial ant societies together, but also allow those societies to rapidly expand.

                              <span>Tontoman shares a report: The White House Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD) urged tech companies to switch to memory-safe programming languages, such as Rust, to improve software security by reducing the number of memory safety vulnerabilities. Such vulnerabilities are coding errors or weaknesses within software that can lead to memory management issues when memory can be accessed, written, allocated, or deallocated. They occur when software accesses memory in unintended or unsafe ways, resulting in various security risks and issues like buffer overflow, use after free, use of uninitialized memory, and double free that attackers can exploit. 

Successful exploitation carries severe risks, potentially enabling threat actors to gain unauthorized access to data or execute malicious code with the privileges of the system owner. &quot;For over 35 years, this same class of vulnerability has vexed the digital ecosystem. The challenge of eliminating entire classes of software vulnerabilities is an urgent and complex problem. Looking forward, new approaches must be taken to mitigate this risk,&quot; ONCD&#x27;s report says. &quot;The highest leverage method to reduce memory safety vulnerabilities is to secure one of the building blocks of cyberspace: the programming language. Using memory safe programming languages can eliminate most memory safety errors.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report (paywalled): As Google grapples with the backlash over the historically inaccurate responses on its Gemini chatbot, Meta Platforms is dealing with a related issue. As part of its work on the forthcoming version of its large language model, Llama 3, Meta is trying to overcome a problem perceived in Llama 2: Its answers to anything at all contentious aren&#x27;t helpful. Safeguards added to Llama 2, which Meta released last July and which powers the artificial intelligence assistant in its apps, prevent the LLM from answering a broad range of questions deemed controversial. These guardrails have made Llama 2 appear too &quot;safe&quot; in the eyes of Meta&#x27;s senior leadership, as well as among some researchers who worked on the model itself, according to people who work at Meta. 

[...] Meta&#x27;s conservative approach with Llama 2 was designed to ward off any public relations disasters, said the people who work at Meta. But researchers are now trying to loosen up Llama 3 so it engages more with users when they ask about difficult topics, offering context rather than just shutting down tricky questions, said two of the people who work at Meta. The new version of the model will in theory be able to better distinguish when a word has multiple meanings. For example, Llama 3 might understand that a question about how to kill a vehicle&#x27;s engine means asking how to shut it off rather than end its life. Meta also plans to appoint someone internally in the coming weeks to oversee tone and safety training as part of its efforts to make the model&#x27;s responses more nuanced, said one of the people. The company plans to release Llama 3 in July, though the timeline could still change, they added.

From a report: Thrasio also entered into a restructuring agreement with some of its lenders to reduce debt of $495 million from its existing debt pile, it said in a statement. It listed its estimated assets in the range of $1 billion to $10 billion and estimated liabilities of $500 million to $1 billion, according to a document filed with the New Jersey bankruptcy court. Billions of dollars, primarily in loans and other debt instruments, were invested into newly-formed startups aggregating third-party merchants on Amazon&#x27;s marketplace during the COVID-19 pandemic as investors bet heavily on a prolonged explosion in online shopping. But as lockdowns eased and consumers returned to brick-and-mortar stores, sales growth on Amazon slowed, leaving these heavily-indebted &quot;roll-up&quot; companies struggling to service interest payments.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: The FBI and partners from 10 other countries are urging owners of Ubiquiti EdgeRouters to check their gear for signs they&#x27;ve been hacked and are being used to conceal ongoing malicious operations by Russian state hackers. The Ubiquiti EdgeRouters make an ideal hideout for hackers. The inexpensive gear, used in homes and small offices, runs a version of Linux that can host malware that surreptitiously runs behind the scenes. The hackers then use the routers to conduct their malicious activities. Rather than using infrastructure and IP addresses that are known to be hostile, the connections come from benign-appearing devices hosted by addresses with trustworthy reputations, allowing them to receive a green light from security defenses.

                              <span>Since Clippy v0.0.97 and before it was shipped with rustup, Clippy
implicitly added a feature &#x3D; &quot;cargo-clippy&quot; config1 when linting your code
with cargo clippy.
Back in the day (2016) this was necessary to allow, warn or deny Clippy lints
using attributes:
#[cfg_attr(feature &#x3D; &quot;cargo-clippy&quot;, allow(clippy_lint_name))]

Doing this hasn&#x27;t been necessary for a long time. Today, Clippy users will set
lint levels with tool lint attributes using the clippy:: prefix:
#[allow(clippy::lint_name)]

The implicit feature &#x3D; &quot;cargo-clippy&quot; has only been kept for backwards
compatibility, but will now be deprecated.
Alternative
As there is a rare use case for conditional compilation depending on Clippy,
we will provide an alternative. So in the future you will be able to use:
#[cfg(clippy)]

It&#x27;s common for advertisements to stage or edit pictures of food to make it look more enticing, but in these cases the ghost kitchens are showing people pictures of food that literally doesn&#x27;t exist, and looks nothing like the actual items they&#x27;re selling, sometimes because the faulty AI is producing physically impossible food items.

                              <span>Amazon has issued an update to Fire TV streaming devices and televisions that has broken apps that let users bypass the Fire OS home screen. From a report: The tech giant claims that its latest Fire OS update is about security but has refused to detail any potential security concerns. Users and app developers have reported that numerous apps that used to work with Fire TV devices for years have suddenly stopped working. As first reported by AFTVnews, the update has made apps unable to establish local Android Debug Bridge (ADB) connections and execute ADB commands with Fire TV devices. 

The update, Fire OS 7.6.6.9, affects several Fire OS-based TVs, including models from TCL, Toshiba, Hisense, and Amazon&#x27;s Fire TV Omni QLED Series. Other devices running the update include Amazon&#x27;s first Fire TV Stick 4K Max, the third-generation Fire TV Stick, as well as the third and second-generation Fire TV Cubes and the Fire TV Stick Lite. A code excerpt shared with AFTVnews by what the publication described as an &quot;affected app developer,&quot; which you can view here, shows a line of code indicating that Fire TVs would not be allowed to make ADB connections with a local device or app. As pointed out by AFTVnews, such apps have been used by Fire TV modders for abilities like clearing installed apps&#x27; cache and using a different home screen than the Fire OS default.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Microsoft is already testing Windows 11 24H2, this fall&#x27;s big new Windows release. The company has already demonstrated a few new features, like 80Gbps USB4 support and Sudo for Windows, and the new version could also give a significant refresh to the Windows installer for the first time since the Windows Vista days. But there&#x27;s one big update you might not notice at all. Late last week, Microsoft released &quot;servicing updates&quot; with no new features to Windows Insiders in the Dev and Canary channels. The updates were &quot;designed to test [Microsoft&#x27;s] servicing pipeline for Windows 11.&quot; It&#x27;s pretty common for Insiders to get these kinds of updates-that-exist-only-to-test-the-update-process, but the twist here is that PCs with Virtualization Based Security (VBS) enabled could apply the update without rebooting. 

Sources speaking to Windows Central say this isn&#x27;t a fluke -- Microsoft reportedly intends to use a Windows Server feature called hotpatching to deliver more Windows 11 security updates without requiring a reboot, making it easier to stay up to date without disrupting whatever you&#x27;re doing. You&#x27;ll still need to reboot &quot;every few months&quot; -- Microsoft&#x27;s documentation says a reboot is needed roughly once every three months, though it can happen more often than that for unanticipated zero-day patches and others that can&#x27;t be fixed via hotpatching. The Arm versions of Windows 11 also won&#x27;t get the feature for another year or so, according to Windows Central.

                              <span>Bloomberg News: Apple is canceling a decade-long effort to build an electric car, according to people with knowledge of the matter, abandoning one of the most ambitious projects in the history of the company. Apple made the disclosure internally Tuesday, surprising the nearly 2,000 employees working on the project, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the announcement wasn&#x27;t public. 

The decision was shared by Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams and Kevin Lynch, a vice president in charge of the effort, according to the people. The two executives told staffers that the project will begin winding down and that many employees on the team working on the car -- known as the Special Projects Group, or SPG -- will be shifted to the artificial intelligence division under executive John Giannandrea. Those employees will focus on generative AI projects, an increasingly key priority for the company. The Apple car team also has several hundred hardware engineers and car designers. It&#x27;s possible that they will be able to apply for jobs on other Apple teams. There will be layoffs, but it&#x27;s unclear how many. 

The decision to ultimately wind down the project is a bombshell for the company, ending a multibillion-dollar effort that would have vaulted Apple into a whole new industry. The tech giant started working on a car around 2014, setting its sights on a fully autonomous electric vehicle with a limousine-like interior and voice-guided navigation. But the project struggled nearly from the start, with Apple changing the team&#x27;s leadership and strategy several times. Lynch and Williams took over the undertaking a few years ago -- following the departure of Doug Field, now a senior executive at Ford Motor.

                              <span>Tumblr and Wordpress are preparing to sell user data to Midjourney and OpenAI, 404Media reported Tuesday, citing a source with internal knowledge about the deals and internal documents. From the report: The exact types of data from each platform going to each company are not spelled out in documentation we&#x27;ve reviewed, but internal communications reviewed by 404 Media make clear that deals between Automattic, the platforms&#x27; parent company, and OpenAI and Midjourney are imminent. The internal documentation details a messy and controversial process within Tumblr itself. One internal post made by Cyle Gage, a product manager at Tumblr, states that a query made to prepare data for OpenAI and Midjourney compiled a huge number of user posts that it wasn&#x27;t supposed to. It is not clear from Gage&#x27;s post whether this data has already been sent to OpenAI and Midjourney, or whether Gage was detailing a process for scrubbing the data before it was to be sent.

                              <span>OpenAI has asked a federal judge to dismiss parts of the New York Times&#x27; copyright lawsuit against it, arguing that the newspaper &quot;hacked&quot; its chatbot ChatGPT and other AI systems to generate misleading evidence for the case. From a report: OpenAI said in a filing in Manhattan federal court on Monday that the Times caused the technology to reproduce its material through &quot;deceptive prompts that blatantly violate OpenAI&#x27;s terms of use.&quot; 

&quot;The allegations in the Times&#x27;s complaint do not meet its famously rigorous journalistic standards,&quot; OpenAI said. &quot;The truth, which will come out in the course of this case, is that the Times paid someone to hack OpenAI&#x27;s products.&quot; OpenAI did not name the &quot;hired gun&quot; who it said the Times used to manipulate its systems and did not accuse the newspaper of breaking any anti-hacking laws.

                              <span>Undersea data cables in the Red Sea have reportedly been damaged, months after Yemeni Houthi rebels threatened to do so. From a report: At least 15 submarine cables pass through the Bab al-Mandab Strait at the southern end of the Red Sea, a body of water just 26km wide at some points. Yemen is the Strait&#x27;s northern shore. The first reports of damage to submarine cables off the coast of Yemen began emerged on Monday morning, with Israeli news outlet Globes claiming that four cables (EIG, AAE-1, Seacom and TGN-EA) had experienced damage. Seacom has reportedly confirmed damage to a cable it operates on a stretch between Kenya and Egypt. 

&quot;The location of the cable break is significant due to its geopolitical sensitivity and ongoing tensions, making it a challenging environment for maintenance and repair operations,&quot; Seacom said. &quot;The team is currently working towards restoration timelines and will communicate these plans with our clients.&quot; Globes attributed the outages to the Iran-backed Houthis, and claimed the damage was &quot;significant, but not critical,&quot; because several other undersea cables serve the region. Seacom has already reassured customers it has re-routed traffic onto other cables. While the world has a decent supply of cable repair ships, they are booked up well in advance so finding one ready to work is not always possible. Nor are cable repairs easy: it takes time to find and retrieve a damaged segment and reconnect it.

                              <span>Streaming revenue will overtake pay TV subscription revenue in the U.S. for the first time later in 2024, helped by the addition of ad tiers by various streamers, according to a new forecast. From a report: Total revenues from streaming, including subscription and advertising revenue, will start topping revenue from pay TV subscriptions in the third quarter of 2024, research company Ampere Analysis projects in a new study unveiled on Monday. &quot;Streaming will continue to race ahead as traditional pay TV declines -- with the value of pay TV in 2028 expected to fall to half the value it saw at its peak in 2017,&quot; it predicts.
Streaming subscribers overtook pay TV subs in the U.S. in 2016, but &quot;streaming&#x27;s lower average revenue per user (ARPU), which currently sits at around a tenth that of pay TV, means that revenue is only now catching up,&quot; Ampere explained. U.S. pay TV revenue will still be narrowly ahead of streaming revenue in the second quarter at $17.1 billion to $17 billion, followed by a $17.3 billion to $16.7 billion streaming lead in the third quarter, according to the research firm&#x27;s projections.

                              <span>AI is likely to replace or at least lend a hand in tasks that take up almost three-quarters of the time bank employees now spend working. From a report: That&#x27;s the conclusion of a new analysis by consultancy Accenture, which said banking has the potential to benefit more from the technology than any other industry. Just 27% of employees&#x27; time currently has a low potential of being transformed, according to the analysis. &quot;There is a reinvention that is happening across banks, a way for firms to step back and re-evaluate ways of working,&quot; Keri Smith, global banking data and AI lead at Accenture, said in an interview. 

The release of ChatGPT more than a year ago prompted many firms to boost hiring for AI-related positions and test more uses for generative AI, which can summarize documents, write emails and churn out responses to users&#x27; questions. The world&#x27;s biggest banks have been experimenting, spurred by the promise that the technology will boost staffers&#x27; productivity and cut costs. &quot;Every bank needs to think through their talent strategy, and how to take this technology to scale,&quot; Smith said. At Citigroup, all 40,000 coders will have the ability to experiment with different AI technologies by the end of March. Analysts at Bank of New York Mellon can wake up two hours later to write their research, because AI technology can create a rough draft and prepare related data for them overnight, Chief Executive Officer Robin Vince said on an earnings call last month.

                              <span>The U.S. and several international partners endorsed shared principles for developing 6G wireless communication systems, the White House said Monday. From a report: A battle is underway to influence the standards of 6G amid concerns by Western countries and their allies that authoritarian regimes could gain further control over Internet in their countries. Policies around wireless communications influence economic-growth and national security, fueling the race between the U.S. and China -- which claimed earlier this month that it had launched the world&#x27;s first satellite &quot;to test 6G architecture,&quot; per state media. 

The governments of the U.S., Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Japan, South Korea, Sweden and the U.K. released a joint statement saying that by working together, &quot;we can support open, free, global, interoperable, reliable, resilient, and secure connectivity.&quot; They laid out principles including using systematic approaches to cybersecurity, being protective of privacy and creating technologies that are widely available and accessible to developing nations.

                              <span>Nvidia&#x27;s completely free, no-strings attached trial of its cloud gaming service GeForce Now is about to be very slightly less of a deal. Nvidia says users will now start seeing ads. From a report: They&#x27;re only for the free tier -- not Priority or Ultimate -- and even then, it sounds like they won&#x27;t interrupt your gameplay. &quot;Free users will start to see up to two minutes of ads while waiting in queue to start a gaming session,&quot; writes Nvidia spokesperson Stephanie Ngo. Currently, the free tier does often involve waiting in line for a remote computer to free up before every hour of free gameplay -- now, I guess there&#x27;ll be a few ads too. Nvidia says the ads should help pay for the free tier of service, and that it expects the change &quot;will reduce average wait times for free users over time.&quot;

                              <span>Maker Roni Bandini developed a Raspberry Pi project to address his neighbors&#x27; loud reggaeton music by creating an AI-driven system that distorts audio on nearby Bluetooth speakers when reggaeton is detected. Tom&#x27;s Hardware reports: Powering this Bluetooth jamming device is a Raspberry Pi 3 B+. It&#x27;s connected to a DFRobot OLED display panel, which has a resolution of 128 x 32px. Audio is observed using a USB microphone, while a push button handles when the system will perform a check to listen for any potential reggaeton. According to Bandini, the Pi is running Raspberry Pi OS. The AI system driving the machine learning aspects of the design is Edge Impulse. With this, Bandini was able to train the Pi to listen for music and more specifically identify whether the song playing is classifiable as reggaeton or not. The official project page is available at Hackster.

                              <span>Some programmers can code under any conditions. Open office? They&#x27;ll bring headphones. Whatever editor is on their system? They&#x27;ll make it work. Using a different framework or language every few years? No problem. I envy that level of versatility, but I&#x27;ve come to accept it just isn&#x27;t me. I bond with a quiet room, an editor, and a programming environment far more deeply than that.
 Case in point, I&#x27;ve been using the TextMate programming editor since it was first created back in 2004. That&#x27;s twenty years now. Almost as long as my time with Ruby working on Rails. TextMate has seen its popularity come and go in that time, and today, few people are still choosing it. But I don&#x27;t care. It&#x27;s damn near Finished Software as far as I&#x27;m concerned, and I love programming with TextMate.

I’m sure there’s some way to teach those things without doing those things, but come on, we all know you have to do those things to really learn those things.
I believe business is in the same category. It’s much closer to learning an art, sport, or instrument than it is to learning history, political science, or another subject primarily taught through written texts, lectures, or observing without doing.
Yet how many entrepreneurship programs out there require their students to start a real business? They may exist, but I’ve been around and haven’t seen one yet. It can be the simplest damn bus…</span>

  But a team that operates remotely still benefits from face-to-face gatherings,

Remote-first teams have everyone in a separate location, communicating
  entirely by email, chat, video and other communication tools. It has definite
  benefits: people can be recruited to the team from all over the world, and we can

                              <span>Landscaping tech company Husqvarna has partnered with Bethesda to bring the original 1993 Doom to its $2,000+ robotic lawnmowers. Kotaku reports: This new way to play Doom arrives in April on all Nera robotic lawnmower models. You don&#x27;t have to pay for the game, either, just a $2,000+ lawnmower. Instead, just download it and play the shooter via the robo-mower&#x27;s built-in screen. To rotate your view, you turn the knob and to shoot demons, you press it down. You hold the start button to move forward.
 
A few caveats to mention. First, this isn&#x27;t available in the United States. Why? I don&#x27;t know. Perhaps we can&#x27;t be trusted with video games on lawnmowers? Secondly, this isn&#x27;t all of Doom. Instead, it&#x27;s just the first episode -- Knee Deep In The Dead -- which is arguably its most famous one, sure, but just keep in mind you won&#x27;t be able to play the rest of the beloved shooter in the middle of your backyard on a tiny LCD screen. Sorry.
 
Sadly, this won&#x27;t be a permanent feature that you can show off to family and friends for years to come. Instead, Doom and all its demons and guns will be removed from lawnmowers on September 9. So enjoy it while you can.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from TorrentFreak: In recent months, Movie-Web has quickly gained popularity among a particular group of movie aficionados. The open source software, which is still available on GitHub, allows anyone to set up a movie search engine capable of streaming content from third-party sources. These external sources tend to have large libraries of pirated entertainment. Movie-web&#x27;s developers are not oblivious to the legal ramifications but since they don&#x27;t host any files, they hoped to avoid legal trouble. The software just provides a search engine for third-party content, they argued. [...]
 
Yesterday, the movie-web.app domain was suddenly taken down. According to a message posted on the official Discord server, this is the result of a &quot;court action&quot; from several movie companies including Warner Bros. Netflix, Paramount, Universal, and Disney. [I]t appears that action was taken against the movie-web.app domain. It seems likely that registrar Namecheap suspended the domain after receiving a legal complaint from the aforementioned Hollywood companies. [Update: After publishing the article we learned that there is a legal action that requires registrars to take action against several &#x27;pirate&#x27; domains. We&#x27;re looking into the matter and will follow this up later.]
 
Namecheap updated the domain&#x27;s status to clientHold, which effectively rendered the domain inaccessible. The measure is often used to suspend pirate site domains following copyright holder complaints. The surprise takedown only affects movie-web&#x27;s publicly hosted &#x27;demo&#x27; instance. On Discord, the movie-web team says that it has no plans to bring this website back in any shape or form. &quot;As a team, we always said that if we were taken down, we would go down without a fight and we have decided to stick to that. We have zero interest in getting involved with legal matters, and so we will not be trying to circumvent this takedown in any way,&quot; developer &#x27;BinaryOverload&#x27; writes.

                              <span>Almost 3 years after launching the first OnePlus Watch, the Chinese smartphone company is launching a successor -- this time powered by Wear OS 4. Utilizing a &quot;hybrid interface,&quot; the OnePlus Watch 2 is able to offer 100 hours of battery life, or just over four full days of use. 9to5Google reports: To achieve that goal, the OnePlus Watch 2 actually runs two separate operating systems. Wear OS handles things like apps and watchfaces, while a RTOS powered by a secondary chipset handles more lightweight tasks. A &quot;smart mode&quot; on the watch allows the watch swap back and forth between its two operating systems and two chipsets. Wear OS is powered by the Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 and it is Wear OS 4. The RTOS is powered by a BES 2700 MCU Efficiency chipset.
 
Switching between the two OS&#x27;s is something you&#x27;re likely to not even notice, OnePlus claims: &quot;The BES2700 Efficiency Chipset runs RTOS and handles background activity and simple tasks, while the Snapdragon W5 handles more demanding tasks, like running your favorite Google apps. This optimized approach, enabled by the Wear OS hybrid interface seamlessly managing the transition between chips, means users will experience a smartwatch that effortlessly does it all while extending the time between charges.&quot;
 
Powering the Watch 2 is a 500 mAh battery which features 7.5W charging with a special charger that connects to a typical USB-C cable. The charger is magnetic, of course, and OnePlus claims a full charge in 60 minutes or less. The 1.43-inch AMOLED display of the OnePlus Watch 2 is covered in a slightly curved sapphire glass, while the watch chassis is built from stainless steel. You&#x27;ll have the choice of black or silver colors with either black or green bands, respectively. The whole package is also 5ATM water resistant. Rounding out the main specs you&#x27;ll find 32GB of storage and 2GB of RAM. The OnePlus Watch 2 goes on sale today at $299.

                              <span>During a briefing at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Meghana Patwardhan, VP of Commercial Mobility at Dell Technology, told The Register that while the immediate future would consist of two worlds -- one with AI hardware and one without -- &quot;every PC is going to be an AI PC in the longer term.&quot; From the report: In terms of new hardware, Dell used the Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona to show off new versions of its Surface-baiting Latitude 7350 convertible -- &quot;the world&#x27;s most serviceable commercial detachable,&quot; according to the company -- and its workstation-class Precision 3680 tower. Other devices in the Precision range include mobile workstations and the 3280 Compact Form Factor PC. Dell was also determined to present itself as a leader in hybrid working with the Premier Wireless ANC headset, replete with AI-based noise cancellation.
 
Duringt our talk, AI was never far from the lips of Dell&#x27;s spokespeople as the company talked up the energy efficiency and future-proofing it saw in dedicated AI hardware, such as Neural Processing Units (NPUs) that are increasingly cropping up in CPUs. To illustrate the point, Dell boatsed about how much more efficient background blurring is on video calls when AI hardware is running compared to when it isn&#x27;t. Hopefully, Microsoft will soon deliver a version of Windows capable of demonstrating a use for AI hardware that is more than hiding distractions in the background.

Currently, though, the company&#x27;s plan for giving disappointed customers &quot;an appropriate value&quot; for their erased digital copies isn&#x27;t very accessible or clear. Earlier this month, Sony-owned Funimation announced that customers&#x27; digital libraries would be unavailable starting on April 2. At that time, Funimation accounts will become Crunchyroll accounts. Sony acquired Crunchyroll in 2021, so some sort of merging of the services was expected.

The document, from Google&#x27;s antitrust case against the U.S. Justice Department, was unsealed on Friday. From a report: In the filing earlier this month, Google argued that Microsoft pitched Apple in 2009, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2018 and 2020 about making Bing the default in Apple&#x27;s Safari web browser, but each time, Apple said no, citing quality issues with Bing. &quot;In each instance, Apple took a hard look at the relative quality of Bing versus Google and concluded that Google was the superior default choice for its Safari users. That is competition,&quot; Google wrote in the filing. 

The Justice Department said in its own newly unsealed filing that Microsoft has spent almost $100 billion on Bing over 20 years. The Windows and Office software maker launched Bing in 2009, following search efforts under the MSN and Windows Live brands. Today Bing has 3% global market share, according to StatCounter. In the fourth quarter, Microsoft generated $3.2 billion from search and news advertising, while Google search and other revenue totaled $48 billion. Google said in its filing that when Microsoft reached out to Apple in 2018, emphasizing gains in Bing&#x27;s quality, Microsoft offered to either sell Bing to Apple or establish a Bing-related joint venture with the company.

                              <span>The US Supreme Court is hearing oral arguments Monday in two cases that could dramatically reshape social media, weighing whether states such as Texas and Florida should have the power to control what posts platforms can remove from their services. From a report: The high-stakes battle gives the nation&#x27;s highest court an enormous say in how millions of Americans get their news and information, as well as whether sites such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and TikTok should be able to make their own decisions about how to moderate spam, hate speech and election misinformation. At issue are laws passed by the two states that prohibit online platforms from removing or demoting user content that expresses viewpoints -- legislation both states say is necessary to prevent censorship of conservative users. 

More than a dozen Republican attorneys general have argued to the court that social media should be treated like traditional utilities such as the landline telephone network. The tech industry, meanwhile, argues that social media companies have First Amendment rights to make editorial decisions about what to show. That makes them more akin to newspapers or cable companies, opponents of the states say.
The case could lead to a significant rethinking of First Amendment principles, according to legal experts. A ruling in favor of the states could weaken or reverse decades of precedent against &quot;compelled speech,&quot; which protects private individuals from government speech mandates, and have far-reaching consequences beyond social media. A defeat for social media companies seems unlikely, but it would instantly transform their business models, according to Blair Levin, an industry analyst at the market research firm New Street Research.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report from the ongoing Mobile World Congress trade show: This year&#x27;s big scrum gatherer was Lenovo&#x27;s long-rumored transparent laptop. It&#x27;s real. It functions surprisingly well and -- nearest anyone can tell -- its existence is a testament to form over function. That&#x27;s a perfectly fine thing to be when you&#x27;re a concept device. When it comes to actually shipping a product, however, that&#x27;s another conversation entirely. [...] Broadly speaking, it looks like a laptop, with a transparent pane where the screen should be. It&#x27;s perhaps best understood as a kind of augmented reality device, in the sense that its graphics are overlaid on whatever happens to be behind it. 

It&#x27;s a crowd pleaser, with a futuristic air to it that embodies all manner of sci-fi tech tropes. The transparent display has become a kind of shorthand for future tech in stock art, and it&#x27;s undeniably neat to see the thing in action. [...] The bottom of the device is covered in a large capacitive touch surface. This area serves as both a keyboard and a large stylus-compatible drawing surface. The flat surface can&#x27;t compete with real, tactile keyboards, of course. Typing isn&#x27;t the greatest experience here, as evidenced by previous dual-screen Lenovo laptops. But that&#x27;s the tradeoff for the versatility of the virtual version.

                              <span>Dr. Ruth Gottesman, a longtime professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, is making free tuition available to all students going forward. From a report: The 93-year-old widow of a Wall Street financier has donated $1 billion to a Bronx medical school, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, with instructions that the gift be used to cover tuition for all students going forward. The donor, Dr. Ruth Gottesman, is a former professor at Einstein, where she studied learning disabilities, developed a screening test and ran literacy programs. It is one of the largest charitable donations to an educational institution in the United States and most likely the largest to a medical school. 

The fortune came from her late husband, David Gottesman, known as Sandy, who was a protege of Warren Buffett and had made an early investment in Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate Mr. Buffett built. The donation is notable not only for its staggering size, but also because it is going to a medical institution in the Bronx, the city&#x27;s poorest borough. The Bronx has a high rate of premature deaths and ranks as the unhealthiest county in New York. Over the past generation, a number of billionaires have given hundreds of millions of dollars to better-known medical schools and hospitals in Manhattan, the city&#x27;s wealthiest borough. 

While her husband ran an investment firm, First Manhattan, Dr. Gottesman had a long career at Einstein, a well-regarded medical school, starting in 1968, when she took a job as director of psychoeducational services. She has long been on Einstein&#x27;s board of trustees and is currently the chair. In recent years, she has become close friends with Dr. Philip Ozuah, the pediatrician who oversees the medical college and its affiliated hospital, Montefiore Medical Center, as the chief executive officer of the health system. That friendship and trust loomed large as she contemplated what to do with the money her husband had left her.

                              <span>Microsoft has struck a deal with French AI startup Mistral as it seeks to broaden its involvement in the fast-growing industry beyond OpenAI. From a report: The US tech giant will provide the 10-month-old Paris-based company with help in bringing its AI models to market. Microsoft will also take a minor stake in Mistral, although the financial details have not been disclosed. The partnership makes Mistral the second company to provide commercial language models available on Microsoft&#x27;s Azure cloud computing platform. Microsoft has already invested about $13 billion in San Francisco-based OpenAI, an alliance that is being reviewed by competition watchdogs in the US, EU and UK. Other Big Tech rivals, such as Google and Amazon, are also investing heavily in building generative AI -- software that can produce text, images and code in seconds -- which analysts believe has the capacity to shake up industries across the world. WSJ adds: On Monday, Mistral plans to announce a new AI model, called Mistral Large, that Mensch said can perform some reasoning tasks comparably with GPT-4, OpenAI&#x27;s most advanced language model to date, and Gemini Ultra, Google&#x27;s new model. Mensch said his new model cost less than 20 million euros, the equivalent of roughly $22 million, to train. By contrast OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman said last year after the release of GPT-4 that training his company&#x27;s biggest models cost &quot;much more than&quot; $50 million to $100 million.

Huang argued that, even at this early stage of the AI revolution, programming is no longer a vital skill. With coding taken care of by AI, Huang suggested humans can instead focus on more valuable expertise like biology, education, manufacturing, or farming

                              <span>OpenAI, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Jeff Bezos are all part of a pack of investors in a business &quot;developing human-like robots,&quot; reports Bloomberg, &quot;according to people with knowledge of the situation...&quot; 

At the startup — which is named &quot;Figure&quot; — engineers &quot;are working on a robot that looks and moves like a human. The company has said it hopes its machine, called Figure 01, will be able to perform dangerous jobs that are unsuitable for people and that its technology will help alleviate labor shortages.&quot;

Figure is raising about $675 million in a funding round that carries a pre-money valuation of roughly $2 billion, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. Through his firm Explore Investments LLC, Bezos has committed $100 million. Microsoft is investing $95 million, while Nvidia and an Amazon.com Inc.-affiliated fund are each providing $50 million... Other technology companies are involved as well. Intel Corp.&#x27;s venture capital arm is pouring in $25 million, and LG Innotek is providing $8.5 million. Samsung&#x27;s investment group, meanwhile, committed $5 million. Backers also include venture firms Parkway Venture Capital, which is investing $100 million, and Align Ventures, which is providing $90 million... 

The AI robotics industry has been busy lately. Earlier this year, OpenAI-backed Norwegian robotics startup 1X Technologies AS raised $100 million. Vancouver-based Sanctuary AI is developing a humanoid robot called Phoenix. And Tesla Inc. is working on a robot called Optimus, with Elon Musk calling it one of his most important projects. Agility Robotics, which Amazon backed in 2022, has bots in testing at one of the retailer&#x27;s warehouses.
Bloomberg calls the investments in Figure &quot;part of a scramble to find new applications for artificial intelligence.&quot;

                              <span>The minimum requirements for Tier 1 toolchains targeting Windows will increase with the 1.78 release (scheduled for May 02, 2024).
Windows 10 will now be the minimum supported version for the *-pc-windows-* targets.
These requirements apply both to the Rust toolchain itself and to binaries produced by Rust.
Two new targets have been added with Windows 7 as their baseline: x86_64-win7-windows-msvc and i686-win7-windows-msvc.
They are starting as Tier 3 targets, meaning that the Rust codebase has support for them but we don&#x27;t build or test them automatically.
Once these targets reach Tier 2 status, they will be available to use via rustup.
Affected targets
x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
i686-pc-windows-msvc
x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
i686-pc-windows-gnu
x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm
i686-pc-windows-gnullvm
Why are the requirements being changed?
Prior to now, Rust had Tier 1 support for Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 but these targets no longer meet our requirements.
In particular, these targets could no longer be tested in CI which is required by the Target Tier Policy and are not supported by their vendor.</span>

                              <span>Julia 1.0 was released in 2018 — after a six-year wait. 

And there&#x27;s now another update. LWN.net gets you up to speed, calling Julia &quot;a general-purpose, open-source programming language with a focus on high-performance scientific computing.&quot;

Some of Julia&#x27;s unusual features: 
- Lisp-inspired metaprogramming
- The ability to examine compiled representations of code in the REPL or in a &quot;reactive notebook&quot;
- An advanced type and dispatch system
- A sophisticated, built-in package manager. 

Version 1.10 brings big increases in speed and developer convenience, especially improvements in code precompilation and loading times. It also features a new parser written in Julia... [I]t is faster, it produces more useful syntax-error messages, and it provides better source-code mapping, which associates locations in compiled code to their corresponding lines in the source. That last improvement also leads to better error messages and makes it possible to write more sophisticated debuggers and linters... 

Between the improvements in precompilation and loading times, and the progress in making small binaries, two major and perennial complaints, of beginners and seasoned Julia users alike, have been addressed... StaticCompiler and related WebAssembly tools will make it easier to write web applications in Julia for direct execution in the browser; it is already possible, but may become more convenient over the next few years.

                              <span>Popular Science points out that for encoding data, &quot;optical disks almost always offer just a single, 2D layer — that reflective, silver underside.&quot; 

&quot;If you could boost a disk&#x27;s number of available, encodable layers, however, you could hypothetically gain a massive amount of extra space...&quot;
Researchers at the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology recently set out to do just that, and published the results earlier this week in the journal, Nature. Using a 54-nanometer laser, the team managed to record a 100 layers of data onto an optical disk, with each tier separated by just 1 micrometer. The final result is an optical disk with a three-dimensional stack of data layers capable of holding a whopping 1 petabit (Pb) of information — that&#x27;s equivalent to 125,000 gigabytes of data... 

As Gizmodo offers for reference, that same petabit of information would require roughly a six-and-a-half foot tall stack of HHD drives — if you tried to encode the same amount of data onto Blu-rays, you&#x27;d need around 10,000 blank ones to complete your (extremely inefficient) challenge. 

To pull off their accomplishment, engineers needed to create an entirely new material for their optical disk&#x27;s film... AIE-DDPR film utilizes a combination of specialized, photosensitive molecules capable of absorbing photonic data at a nanoscale level, which is then encoded using a high-tech dual-laser array. Because AIE-DDPR is so incredibly transparent, designers could apply layer-upon-layer to an optical disk without worrying about degrading the overall data. This basically generated a 3D &quot;box&quot; for digitized information, thus exponentially raising the normal-sized disk&#x27;s capacity.

                              <span>CNN reports:

AT&amp;T is reimbursing customers for the nearly 12-hour network outage on Thursday, the company announced in a news release. The mobile network will issue a $5 credit to &quot;potentially impacted&quot; AT&amp;T Wireless customers, which it says is the &quot;average cost of a full day of service.&quot;
 
The credit will be applied automatically &quot;within 2 bill cycles,&quot; according to an announcement at the URL att.com/makeitright. &quot;We recognize the frustration this outage has caused and know we let many of our customers down.&quot; 

In a much smaller font, they note that the credit &quot;does not apply to AT&amp;T Business, AT&amp;T Prepaid or Cricket. 

More from CNN:

AT&amp;T had encountered sporadic service interruptions in the days leading up to the outage, including a temporary 911 outage in some parts of the southeast. While regional disruptions to wireless service happen occasionally, prolonged nationwide outages are rare. The Federal Communications Commission confirmed Thursday it was investigating the incident... 

 Several hours after service was restored, AT&amp;T released an update stating the outage seemed to be the result of an internal issue, not a cybersecurity threat. &quot;Based on our initial review, we believe that today&#x27;s outage was caused by the application and execution of an incorrect process used as we were expanding our network,&quot; the company said. 

On Saturday, AT&amp;T reiterated it was taking steps &quot;to prevent this from happening again in the future,&quot; but did not elaborate.

                              <span>jd (Slashdot reader #1,658) writes: The Register has been running a series of articles about the evolution of Unix, from humble beginnings to the transition to Plan9. There is a short discussion of why Plan9 and its successors never really took off (despite being vastly superior to microkernels), along with the ongoing development of 9Front. 



From the article:

Plan 9 was in some way a second implementation of the core concepts of Unix and C, but reconsidered for a world of networked graphical workstations. It took many of the trendy ideas of late-1980s computing, both of academic theories and of the computer industry of the time, and it reinterpreted them through the jaded eyes of two great gurus, Kenneth Thompson and Dennis Ritchie (and their students) — arguably, design geniuses who saw their previous good ideas misunderstood and misinterpreted.

 In Plan 9, networking is front and center. There are good reasons why this wasn&#x27;t the case with Unix — it was being designed and built at the same time as local area networking was being invented. UNIX Fourth Edition, the first version written in C, was released in 1973 — the same year as the first version of Ethernet.

 Plan 9 puts networking right into the heart of the design. While Unix was later used as the most common OS for standalone workstations, Plan 9 was designed for clusters of computers, some being graphical desktops and some shared servers...

 Because everything really is a file, displaying a window on another machine can be as simple as making a directory and populating it with some files. You can start programs on other computers, but display the results on yours — all without any need for X11 or any visible networking at all. 

This means all the Unixy stuff about telnet and rsh and ssh and X forwarding and so on just goes away. It makes X11 look very overcomplicated, and it makes Wayland look like it was invented by Microsoft.

                              <span>Netflix&#x27;s new sci-fi drama Spaceman centers on Czech astronaut Jakub Procházk, described by Polygon as &quot;painfully introverted, emotionally repressed, and above all, quiet... so muted and compressed, he seems like a trauma victim.&quot;

The film, adapted from the 2017 novel Spaceman of Bohemia written by Czech author Jaroslav KalfaÅ(TM), is a solemn drama in the mold of Andrei Tarkovsky&#x27;s Solaris, or to some degree, Christopher Nolan&#x27;s Interstellar. The story revolves around Jakub&#x27;s disintegrating frame of mind after eight months alone in space as he investigates a glowing cosmic phenomenon that&#x27;s become visible from Earth. Meanwhile, his wife Lenka (Carey Mulligan), heavily pregnant and going through her own breakdown back home, decides to leave Jakub, and his handlers (Isabella Rossellini among them) work to keep him from finding out. And then the giant spider appears, and Jakub worries that he&#x27;s losing his mind.
 

CNN says Sandler&#x27;s deal with Netflix &quot;means pretty much doing whatever he wants, which, in the case of Spaceman, means traveling to the furthest reaches of space as the near-solitary star of a pretentious, message-heavy drama.&quot; 

You can watch a trailer here. The movie enjoys a &quot;limited theatrical release&quot; this weekend, and will stream on Netflix starting March 1.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this report from Electrek:

Renewable developer Clearway Energy Group has completed a 452-megawatt (MW) solar farm in West Texas — and it&#x27;s huge... It&#x27;s built on around 5,000 acres of land and features over 1.1 million solar panels... Texas Solar Nova will generate enough electricity to power over 190,000 homes annually. 

It&#x27;s got an offtake agreement with telecoms giant Verizon, and agreements with auto component maker Toyota Boshoku and Swedish bearing and seal maker SKF to purchase renewable energy certificates (RECs). Both Toyota Boshoku and SKF have 12-year agreements for RECs. 

The $660 million facility will &quot;contribute significantly to the local tax base,&quot; the company said in a statement, &quot;starting with an estimated $5.4 million in property taxes and wages to be paid in the first year.&quot;

                              <span>A U.S. government auction site was breached by an Oklahoma man, reports NBC News. So when it came time to pay up on his winning bids, he &quot;falsified the true auction price to $1,&quot; according to the U.S. attorney&#x27;s office. 

He defrauded the government out of more than $150,000 between Jan. 31 and March 21, 2019, the indictment alleges. Included in the $1-buys were a 2010 Ford Escape Hybrid, for which Coker submitted a bid of $8,327; a Ford F550 pickup, with a bid of $9,000; and a Chevrolet C4500 box truck, bid $22,700; the U.S. attorney&#x27;s office said... 

Nineteen items in all were bought through the auctions, according to prosecutors. Coker used eight accounts and pre-paid debit cards with very little balances to make the purchases, the indictment says. 

&quot;Coker was indicted on three counts of wire fraud in March 2023 and pleaded guilty to one count Wednesday, according to court records.&quot;

                              <span>&quot;One London resident watched on CCTV as a thief walked up to his £40,000 car and drove away,&quot; reports the Observer. &quot;Now manufacturers say they are being drawn in to a hi-tech &#x27;arms race&#x27; with criminals.&quot;


[H]i-tech devices disguised as handheld games consoles are being traded online for thousands of pounds and are used by organised crime gangs to mimic the electronic key on an Ioniq 5, opening the doors and starting the engine. The device, known as an &quot;emulator&quot;, works by intercepting a signal from the car, which is scanning for the presence of a legitimate key, and sending back a signal to gain access to the vehicle... 

Hyundai says it is looking at measures to prevent the use of emulators &quot;as a priority&quot;. But it is not the only carmaker whose vehicles appear to be vulnerable. An Observer investigation found that models by Toyota, Lexus and Kia have also been targeted... British motorists now face an increase in the number of thefts and rising insurance premiums... Car thefts are at their highest level for a decade in England and Wales, rising from 85,803 vehicles in the year to March 2012 to 130,270 in the year to March 2023 — an increase of more than 50%. Part of the reason, say experts, is the rise of keyless entry... 

Kia did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Toyota, which owns Lexus, said: &quot;Toyota and Lexus are continuously working on developing technical solutions to make vehicles more secure. Since introducing enhanced security hardware on the latest versions of a number of models, we have seen a significant drop-off in thefts. For older models we are currently developing solutions.&quot; 

Another common attack requires entry to the vehicle first, according to the article, but then uses the vehicle&#x27;s onboard diagnostic port to program &quot;a new key linked to the vehicle...&quot; 

&quot;Many owners of Ioniq 5s, which sell from around £42,000, now use steering locks to deter thieves.&quot;

                              <span>&quot;The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which selects Nobel laureates in chemistry and physics, last week awarded Dr. Wu its Sjöberg Prize in honor of &#x27;decisive contributions&#x27; to cancer research,&quot; reports CNN. 

Their profile of the oncologist from Boston&#x27;s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute notes Dr. Wu&#x27;s research &quot;has laid the scientific foundation for the development of cancer vaccines tailored to the genetic makeup of an individual&#x27;s tumor.&quot;

It&#x27;s a strategy looking increasingly promising for some hard-to-treat cancers such as melanoma and pancreatic cancer, according to the results of early-stage trials, and may ultimately be widely applicable to many of the 200 or so forms of cancer...

                              <span>In addition to trying out Windows for a week, I also switched my main phone number to Android recently. And that turned out to be far easier. Dangerously easy, you might say, if you were in Apple’s shoes. But it’s all down to how deep you’re mired in the platform services soup.
I used to be all-in on the Apple software story. Apple Mail, Apple Calendar, Apple Notes, Apple Photos, iMessage, Apple Just-About-Everything. It’s really hard to switch from iPhone to Android when that’s the case. But it’s surprisingly easy to make that not the case, and then switching becomes trivial.
For me, HEY delivered two easy outs on the key apps I use on a phone: Email + Calendar. With the HEY combo now packing both, there was literally zero lock-in on that front hopping from an iPhone 15 Pro to a Samsung S…</span>

                              <span>I’m kinda shocked. Windows actually got good for web developers. Between VSCode, WSL, and Intel’s latest desktop chips, I’ve been living with a PC for over a week that runs my programming tests faster than an M3 Max, ships with an excellent window manager out-the-box, and generally feels like a completely viable alternative to macOS for working with the web.
Hell, not just viable, but better in many regards. WSL lets you run a real Linux distribution natively, so you can use the same package manager that you’ll deploy against. Oh, and since it’s x86, you’ll be building Docker images for your server hardware in a fraction of the time it takes to multi-arch on arm64.
Now it’s true that to get this kind of speed, you need to rock a desktop machine. The Dell I got had an Intel i9-14900K, which…</span>

  The view from Cupertino.

The DMA requires Apple to open the iPhone to competing app stores, and and its lopsided proposal for &quot;enabling&quot; them is getting most of the press. But Apple knows it has native stores right where it wants them. Cupertino&#x27;s noxious requirements will take years to litigate. Meanwhile, potential competitors are only that.
But Cupertino can&#x27;t delay the DMA&#x27;s other mandate: real browsers, downloaded from Apple&#x27;s own app store. S…</span>

                              <span>&quot;If you drive a car in California, you may be in for a payday thanks to a lawsuit alleging privacy violations by a Texas company,&quot; report SFGate:

The 2021 lawsuit, given class-action status in September, alleges that Digital Recognition Network is breaking a California law meant to regulate the use of automatic license plate readers. DRN, a Fort Worth-based company, uses plate-scanning cameras to create location data for people&#x27;s vehicles, then sells that data to marketers, car repossessors and insurers. 

What&#x27;s particularly notable about the case is the size of the class. The court has established that if you&#x27;re a California resident whose license plate data was collected by DRN at least 15 times since June 2017, you&#x27;re a class member. The plaintiff&#x27;s legal team estimates that the tally includes about 23 million people, alleging that DRN cameras were mounted to cars on public roads. The case website lets Californians check whether their plates were scanned. 

Barring a settlement or delay, the trial to decide whether DRN must pay a penalty to those class members will begin on May 17 in San Diego County Superior Court...

The company&#x27;s cameras scan 220 million plates a month, its website says, and customers can use plate data to &quot;create comprehensive vehicle stories.&quot;
 
A lawyer for the firm representing class members told SFGATE Friday that his team will try to show DRN&#x27;s business is a &quot;mass surveillance program.&quot;

                              <span>On Wednesday Boeing &quot;removed executive Ed Clark, the head of its 737 Max passenger jet program,&quot; reports CNN, &quot;after a dramatic — and terrifying — midair blowout in January underscored ongoing problems with the jet.&quot;


 A preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board found that the four bolts that should have held the door plug in place were missing when the plane left Boeing&#x27;s factory. The NTSB report did not assess blame for the missing bolts and the accident but in a statement to investors before the findings were released, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun assumed responsibility for the incident. &quot;We caused the problem, and we understand that,&quot; he told investors during a call after reporting the latest quarterly loss at the company. &quot;Whatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened.&quot; 

 Clark, who had been at Boeing for 18 years, had only been in charge of the Max program since March of 2021, assuming that title after the jets had been returned to service following the crashes. But he had previously held roles related to the 737 Max, including as chief engineer and chief 737 mechanic. 

With the news of Clark&#x27;s departure, Boeing also announced a shuffling of a number of executives in its Boeing Commercial Airplanes unit. It created a new executive position, Senior Vice President for BCA Quality, and named Elizabeth Lund to that position.

The Covid death toll in the U.S. is likely at least 16% higher than the official tally, according to a new study, and researchers believe the cause of the undercounting goes beyond overloaded health systems to a lack of awareness of Covid and low levels of testing. 

The second year of the pandemic also had nearly as many uncounted excess deaths as the first, the study found. 

More than 1.1 million Americans have died from Covid, according to official records. But the actual number is assuredly higher, given the high rates of excess deaths. Demographers wanted to know how many could be attributed to Covid, and they drilled down to data at the county level to discover patterns in geography and time. There were 1.2 million excess deaths from natural causes — excluding …</span>

But &quot;There has to be some way of connecting the businesses that are being built on top of Linkerd back to funding the project,&quot; argues Buoyant CEO William Morgan. &quot;If we don&#x27;t do that, then there&#x27;s no way for us to evolve this project and to grow it in the way that I think we all want.&quot; 
And so, TechTarget reports...
Beginning May 21, 2024, any company with more than 50 employees running Linkerd in production must pay Buoyant $2,000 per Kubernetes cluster per month to access stable releases of the project...

But then &quot;constitutional freedoms&quot; group New Civil Liberties Alliance (founded with seed money from the Charles Koch Foundation) objected.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this report from CNN:


Dynabook Americas, the company formerly known as Toshiba, has recalled 15.5 million Toshiba laptop AC adapters over potential burn and fire hazards. 

The company said it received 679 reports of the recalled AC adapters overheating or catching on fire, melting and burning, including 43 reports of minor burn injuries. Consumers should stop using the adapters immediately and contact them for a free replacement, Dynabook Americas said. 

The recall applies to AC adapters sold both alongside Toshiba personal laptop computers and sold separately, with date codes ranging between April 2008 through December 2012. The adapters were manufactured in China. More than 60 models are part of the recall. The company published a webpage listing the impacted model numbers and serial numbers for the adapters. 
Gatner points out the adapters are for &quot;very old models,&quot; so &quot;it&#x27;s only a very small percentage of the population that is still using them.&quot; 
The article cites figures from Gartner showing that while Toshiba once led the laptop market, it now makes up about 1%. &quot;Nowadays, Lenovo dominates the category with 25%, followed by HP (22%), Dell (17%) and Apple (9%).&quot;

                              <span>Stack Overflow&#x27;s blog reports on a new programming language called Mariposa. 

They call it a &quot;toy&quot; programming language, &quot;created as a way to play around with a novel or odd feature, like variable assignment outside of the normal order of execution — more colloquially, time travel.&quot;


Computer science has long sought to reason about time in electronic systems, thanks to a consistent interest in concurrency and real-time messaging... Mariposa allows you to manipulate the order of execution by assigning an instant to a variable, then setting the context of that instance. Here&#x27;s a basic example, taken from the Mariposa readme: 

x &#x3D; 1
t &#x3D; now()
print(x)
at t:
 x &#x3D; 2
 

According to the normal order of operations, this code should print &quot;1&quot;. But because t is assigned to the instance in the second line, any modifications specified within an at t: block are applied immediately, and this code prints &quot;2&quot;... 

While Mariposa caught a fair amount of attention recently, it&#x27;s not the first implementation of time travel in programming. There is a Haskell package appropriately called tardis, which creates two state transformers: one travels forward in time and one backward. As the docs explain, &quot;The most concise way to explain it is this: getPast retrieves the value from the latest sendFuture, while getFuture retrieves the value from the next sendPast.&quot; One function&#x27;s past is another one&#x27;s future. 

The article explores &quot;the history and future of other programming paradigms&quot; applying logic to time, including interval temporal logic systems as well as &quot;modeling, analysis, and verification languages/tools that allow temporal and state modeling without requiring temporal logic understanding.&quot;
