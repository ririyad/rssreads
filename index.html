                              <span>Code within the latest version of the ChatGPT Android app suggests that you&#x27;ll soon be able to set it as the default assistant app, replacing the Google Assistant. Android Authority&#x27;s Mishaal Rahman reports: ChatGPT version 1.2023.352, released last month, added a new activity named com.openai.voice.assistant.AssistantActivity. The activity is disabled by default, but after manually enabling and launching it, an overlay appears on the screen with the same swirling animation as the one shown when using the in-app voice chat mode. This overlay appears over other apps and doesn&#x27;t take up the entire screen like the in-app voice chat mode. So, presumably, you could talk to ChatGPT from any screen by invoking this assistant. However, in my testing, the animation never finished and the activity promptly closed itself before I could speak with the chatbot. This could either be because the feature isn&#x27;t finished yet or is being controlled by some internal flag. [...]
 
However, the fact that the aforementioned XML file even exists hints that this is what OpenAI intends to do with the app. Making the ChatGPT app Android&#x27;s default digital assistant app would enable users to launch it by long-pressing the home button (if using three-button navigation) or swiping up from a bottom corner (if using gesture navigation). Unfortunately, the ChatGPT app still wouldn&#x27;t be able to create custom hotwords or respond to existing ones, since that functionality requires access to privileged APIs only available to trusted, preinstalled apps. Still, given that Google will launch Assistant with Bard any day now, it makes sense that OpenAI wants to make it easier for Android users to access ChatGPT so that users don&#x27;t flock to Bard just because it&#x27;s easier to use.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from VICE News: Last week border officials in the Punjab region of India revealed they intercepted 107 drug-carrying drones sent by smuggling gangs last year over the border from Pakistan, the highest number on record. Most were carrying heroin or opium from Pakistan to be dropped and received by collaborators in the Punjab, notorious for having India&#x27;s worst levels of opiate addiction. Last year the head of a police narcotics unit in Lahore, a city in Pakistan which borders the Punjab, was dismissed after he was suspected of running a drug trafficking gang sending drones over to India. But the use of cheap flying robots instead of humans to smuggle drugs across borders is a worldwide phenomenon. [...]

The Verge reports: When connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the &quot;Storm Watch&quot; feature so that you&#x27;re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions. The collaboration is possible thanks to Tesla&#x27;s API, which Samsung claims SmartThings Energy is the first to take advantage of.

As the music industry shifts towards algorithmic suggestions and TikTok emerges as a major music promoter, Spotify&#x27;s strategy evolves with more automated music discovery and less emphasis on human-curated playlists, signaling a potential end to the era where a few key playlists could make a star overnight. Bloomberg reports: Enter TikTok. In the late 2010s, as the algorithmic controlled, short-form video app emerged as a growing force in music promotion, Spotify took notice. On an earnings call in 2020, Spotify Chief Executive Officer Daniel Ek noted that users were increasingly opting for algorithmic suggestions and t…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from the New York Times: The Justice Department is in the late stages of an investigation into Apple and could file a sweeping antitrust case taking aim at the company&#x27;s strategies to protect the dominance of the iPhone as soon as the first half of this year, said three people with knowledge of the matter. The agency is focused on how Apple has used its control over its hardware and software to make it more difficult for consumers to ditch the company&#x27;s devices, as well as for rivals to compete, said the people, who spoke anonymously because the investigation was active. Specifically, investigators have examined how the Apple Watch works better with the iPhone than with other brands, as well as how Apple locks competitors out of its iMessage service. They have also scrutinized Apple&#x27;s payments system for the iPhone, which blocks other financial firms from offering similar services, these people said.
 
The Justice Department is closing in on what would be the most consequential federal antitrust lawsuit challenging Apple, which is the most valuable tech company in the world. If the lawsuit is filed, American regulators will have sued four of the biggest tech companies for monopolistic business practices in less than five years. The Justice Department is currently facing off against Google in two antitrust cases, focused on its search and ad tech businesses, while the Federal Trade Commission has sued Amazon and Meta for stifling competition. The Apple suit would likely be even more expansive than previous challenges to the company, attacking its powerful business model that draws together the iPhone with devices like the Apple Watch and services like Apple Pay to attract and keep consumers loyal to its products. Rivals have said that they have been denied access to key Apple features, like the Siri virtual assistant, prompting them to argue the practices are anticompetitive.

                              <span>Microsoft has begun ditching WordPad from Windows and removed the editor from the first Canary Channel build of 2024. From a report: We knew it was coming, but the reality has arrived in the Canary Channel. A clean install will omit WordPad as of build 26020 of Windows 11. At an undisclosed point, the application will be removed on upgrade. 

The People app is also being axed, as expected, and the Steps Recorder won&#x27;t be getting any more updates and will instead show a banner encouraging users to try something else. Perhaps ClipChamp? WordPad was always an odd tool. Certainly not something one would want to edit text with, but not much of a word processor either. It feels like a throwback to a previous era. However, it was also free, came with Windows, and didn&#x27;t insist on having a connection to the internet for it to work.

                              <span>Huawei&#x27;s newest laptop runs on a chip made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., a teardown of the device showed, quashing talk of another Chinese technological breakthrough. From a report: The Qingyun L540 notebook contains a 5-nanometer chip made by the Taiwanese company in 2020, around the time US sanctions cut off Huawei&#x27;s access to the chipmaker, research firm TechInsights found after dismantling the device for Bloomberg News. That counters speculation that Huawei&#x27;s mainland Chinese chipmaking partner, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., may have achieved a major leap in fabrication technique. 

Huawei caused a stir in the US and China last August when it released a smartphone with a 7nm processor made by Shanghai-based SMIC. A teardown by the Canada-based research outfit for Bloomberg News showed the Mate 60 Pro&#x27;s chip was only a few years behind the cutting edge, a feat that US trade curbs were meant to prevent. That revelation spurred celebration across the Chinese tech scene, and a debate in the US about the effectiveness of sanctions.

                              <span>The Food and Drug Administration has allowed Florida to import millions of dollars worth of medications from Canada at far lower prices than in the United States, overriding fierce decades-long objections from the pharmaceutical industry. From a report: The approval, issued in a letter to Florida Friday, is a major policy shift for the United States, and supporters hope it will be a significant step forward in the long and largely unsuccessful effort to rein in drug prices. Individuals in the United States are allowed to buy directly from Canadian pharmacies, but states have long wanted to be able to purchase medicines in bulk for their Medicaid programs, government clinics and prisons from Canadian wholesalers. 

Florida has estimated that it could save up to $150 million in its first year of the program, importing medicines that treat H.I.V., AIDS, diabetes, hepatitis C and psychiatric conditions. Other states have applied to the F.D.A. to set up similar programs. But significant hurdles remain. The pharmaceutical industry&#x27;s major lobbying organization, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, which has sued over previous importation efforts, is expected to file suit to prevent the Florida plan from going into effect. Some drug manufacturers have agreements with Canadian wholesalers not to export their medicines, and the Canadian government has already taken steps to block the export of prescription drugs that are in short supply.

                              <span>As the number of bees and other pollinators falls, field pansies are adapting by fertilizing their own seeds, a new study found. From a report: Every spring, trillions of flowers mate with the help of bees and other animals. They lure the pollinators to their flowers with flashy colors and nectar. As the animals travel from flower to flower, they take pollen with them, which can fertilize the seeds of other plants. A new study suggests that humans are quickly altering this annual rite of spring. As toxic pesticides and vanishing habitats have driven down the populations of bees and other pollinators, some flowers have evolved to fertilize their own seeds more often, rather than those of other plants.

                              <span>Little noticed, days before the holiday break, Boeing petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration for an exemption from key safety standards for the 737 MAX 7 -- the still-uncertified smallest member of its newest jet family. Seattle Times: Since August, earlier models of the MAX currently flying passengers in the U.S. have had to limit use of the jet&#x27;s engine anti-ice system after Boeing discovered a defect in the system with potentially catastrophic consequences. The flaw could cause the inlet at the front end of the pod surrounding the engine -- known as a nacelle -- to break and fall off. 

In an August Airworthiness Directive, the FAA stated that debris from such a breakup could penetrate the fuselage, putting passengers seated at windows behind the wings in danger, and could damage the wing or tail of the plane, &quot;which could result in loss of control of the airplane.&quot; Dennis Tajer, a spokesperson for the Allied Pilots Association, the union representing 15,000 American Airlines pilots, said the flaw in the engine anti-ice system has &quot;given us great concern.&quot; He said the pilot procedure the FAA approved as an interim solution -- urging pilots to make sure to turn off the system when icing conditions dissipate to avoid overheating that within five minutes could seriously damage the structure of the nacelle -- is inadequate given the serious potential danger. 

&quot;You get our attention when you say people might get killed,&quot; Tajer said. &quot;We&#x27;re not interested in seeing exemptions and accommodations that depend on human memory. ... There&#x27;s just got to be a better way.&quot; In its petition to the FAA, Boeing argues the breakup of the engine nacelle is &quot;extremely improbable&quot; and that an exemption will not reduce safety. &quot;The 737 MAX has been in service since 2017 and has accumulated over 6.5 million flight hours. In that time, there have been no reported cases of parts departing aircraft due to overheating of the engine nacelle inlet structure,&quot; the filing states.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: The DeepMind robotics team has revealed three new advances that it says will help robots make faster, better, and safer decisions in the wild. One includes a system for gathering training data with a &quot;Robot Constitution&quot; to make sure your robot office assistant can fetch you more printer paper -- but without mowing down a human co-worker who happens to be in the way. 

Google&#x27;s data gathering system, AutoRT, can use a visual language model (VLM) and large language model (LLM) working hand in hand to understand its environment, adapt to unfamiliar settings, and decide on appropriate tasks. The Robot Constitution, which is inspired by Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Three Laws of Robotics,&quot; is described as a set of &quot;safety-focused prompts&quot; instructing the LLM to avoid choosing tasks that involve humans, animals, sharp objects, and even electrical appliances. 

For additional safety, DeepMind programmed the robots to stop automatically if the force on its joints goes past a certain threshold and included a physical kill switch human operators can use to deactivate them. Over a period of seven months, Google deployed a fleet of 53 AutoRT robots into four different office buildings and conducted over 77,000 trials. Some robots were controlled remotely by human operators, while others operated either based on a script or completely autonomously using Google&#x27;s Robotic Transformer (RT-2) AI learning model.

                              <span>Orange Espana, Spain&#x27;s second-biggest mobile operator, suffered a major outage on Wednesday after an unknown party obtained a &quot;ridiculously weak&quot; password and used it to access an account for managing the global routing table that controls which networks deliver the company&#x27;s Internet traffic, researchers said. From a report: The hijacking began around 9:28 Coordinated Universal Time (about 2:28 Pacific time) when the party logged into Orange&#x27;s RIPE NCC account using the password &quot;ripeadmin&quot; (minus the quotation marks). The RIPE Network Coordination Center is one of five Regional Internet Registries, which are responsible for managing and allocating IP addresses to Internet service providers, telecommunication organizations, and companies that manage their own network infrastructure. RIPE serves 75 countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia. 

The password came to light after the party, using the moniker Snow, posted an image to social media that showed the orange.es email address associated with the RIPE account. RIPE said it&#x27;s working on ways to beef up account security. Security firm Hudson Rock plugged the email address into a database it maintains to track credentials for sale in online bazaars. In a post, the security firm said the username and &quot;ridiculously weak&quot; password were harvested by information-stealing malware that had been installed on an Orange computer since September. The password was then made available for sale on an infostealer marketplace.

                              <span>China&#x27;s top diplomat warned the US that decoupling would be &quot;self defeating&quot; as the country set out to implement a recent agreement made between their leaders. From a report: Foreign Minister Wang Yi, speaking on Friday at an event to mark the 45th anniversary of US-China diplomatic relations, cited a slew of initiatives that reflect improved ties including streamlined visas for US travelers, a counternarcotics working group to battle the flow of the synthetic fentanyl to the US, and the sending of pandas to the US by the end of the year. &quot;Any decoupling attempt to stem the tide will only be counterproductive and self defeating,&quot; Wang said. 

David Meale, deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, joined Friday&#x27;s event as charge d&#x27;affaires with Ambassador Nicholas Burns out of town. Tensions between China and the US started to ease after President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met in November. The talks resulted in a resumption of high-level military-to-military ties, a promise to collaborate on the fentanyl problem and a commitment to boost interactions between people in the two countries.

                              <span>Google is collecting the eyelid shape and skin tone of children via parent submitted videos, according to a project description online reviewed by 404 Media. From the report: Canadian tech conglomerate TELUS, which says it is working on Google&#x27;s behalf, is offering parents $50 to film their children wearing various props such as hats or sunglasses as part of the project, the description adds. The project shows the methods some companies are using to build machine learning, artificial intelligence, or facial recognition datasets and products. Rather than scraping already existing images or analyzing previously collected material, TELUS, and by extension Google, is asking the public to contribute directly and get paid in return. Google told 404 Media the collection was part of the company&#x27;s efforts to verify users&#x27; age.

                              <span>Netflix has said it plans to be in gaming for years to come. Now the company is trying to figure out how to make money from it, a potential shift in strategy for the streamer. From a report: Executives at the streaming giant have had discussions in recent months about how to generate revenue from its games, according to people familiar with the discussions. Netflix games are currently free for all subscribers, part of a strategy to keep users coming back to the streaming service when their favorite shows are between seasons as well as to attract new fans. 

Some of the ideas that have been discussed include in-app purchases, charging for more sophisticated games it is developing or giving subscribers to its newer ad-supported tier access to games with ads in them, the people said. Such moves would mark a pivot for Netflix, which has resisted putting ads or in-app purchases in its games. [...] Netflix encourages open debate internally on its strategy, which is a key pillar of its culture, and such discussions don&#x27;t mean the company will decide to monetize games.

                              <span>According to MoffettNathanson, the U.S. pay-TV industry had its worst-ever third quarter after losing about 900,000 subscribers. &quot;That poor result, the research firm added, left the total pay-TV industry shrinking at a record pace of -7.3%, widened from a year-ago decline of -5.9%,&quot; reports Light Reading. &quot;It also left pay-TV penetration of occupied households (including vMVPDs) at just 54.8% -- a level last seen in 1989, five years before the debut of DirecTV.&quot; From the report: Drilling down on Q3 results, traditional pay-TV providers (cable, telco and satellite) shed 1.97 million subscribers, widened from a loss of 1.94 million in the year-ago quarter. Within that category, US cable lost 1.10 million video subs in Q3, versus a loss of -1.09 million in the year-ago period. Satellite operators (Dish Network and DirecTV) lost 667,000 subs in Q3, versus -567,000 in the year-ago quarter. Telco TV providers lost 198,000 video subs in the period, an improvement when compared to a year-ago loss of -250,000 subs.
 
vMVPDs, meanwhile, added 1.08 million in Q3, down from a year-ago gain of about 1.34 million. Despite those gains, vMVPDs recaptured only 21.7% of traditional pay-TV&#x27;s subscriber losses in the period, according to MoffettNathanson. Meanwhile, YouTube TV continues to dominate the vMVPD category. MoffettNathanson estimates that YouTube TV added about 350,000 subs in Q3, extending its total to 7 million -- representing 40% of the vMVPD sector&#x27;s 18 million subscriber total. &quot;Based on our Q3 estimate, YouTube TV has now surpassed Dish Network [6.72 million satellite TV subs at the end of Q3] to become the country&#x27;s fourth largest MVPD of any kind,&quot; Moffett noted. &quot;At the current trajectory, YouTube TV should pass DirecTV for third place in less than a year.&quot;

While the chatty AI bot has previously underwhelmed with its attempts to diagnose challenging medical cases -- with an accuracy rate of 39 percent in an analysis last year -- a study out this week in JAMA Pediatrics suggests the fourth version of the large language model is especially bad with kids. It had an accuracy rate of just 17 percent when diagnosing pediatric medical cases. The low success rate suggests human pediatricians won&#x27;t be out of jobs any time soon, in case that was a concern. As the authors put it: &quot;[T]his study underscores the invaluable role that clinical experience holds.&quot; But it also identifies the critical weaknesses that led to ChatGPT&#x27;s high error rate and ways to transform it int…</span>

                              <span>As spotted by X user bedros_p, Google appears to be preparing to introduce a paid upgrade for Bard Advanced, a &quot;new, cutting-edge AI experience&quot; announced in December that gives users access to Google&#x27;s best models and capabilities. Android Police reports: According to the strings, you will be able to &quot;Try Bard Advanced for 3 months, on us.&quot; After that test period, you will likely have to pay up for the service. A defunct link within the code suggests that it may be part of Google One, but it&#x27;s not clear if Bard Advanced will be added to all tiers or only more expensive ones with more Google Drive storage. It&#x27;s also possible that it will be an extra new tier in Google One.
 
As a refresher, Google launched its most capable AI model yet in December 2023, called Gemini. The LLM is available in three tiers, including a Nano version capable of running on devices like phones and a Pro version currently powering Bard in the US. There is also a Gemini Ultra which isn&#x27;t public just yet, but supposedly outperforms other LLMs in almost all metrics. Google says that this is the one that will power Bard Advanced.

                              <span>Michael Larabel reports via Phoronix: AMD engineers are proposing an FPGA Subsystem User-Space Interface to overcome current limitations of the Linux kernel&#x27;s FPGA manager subsystem. AMD-Xilinx engineers are proposing a new sysfs interface for the FPGA subsystem that allows for more user-space control over FPGAs. The suggested interface would handle FPGA configuration, driver probe/remove, bridges, Device Tree Overlay file support for re-programming an FPGA while the operating system is running, and other capabilities for user-space not currently presented by the mainline kernel. [...] This proposal from AMD hopes to standardize the FPGA subsystem user-space interface in a manner that is suitable for upstreaming into the mainline Linux kernel.

The sprawling three-story structure will be known as the UCLA Research Park and will house two multidisciplinary centers focusing on immunology and immunotherapy as well as quantum science and engineering. Establishment of the public-private research center is a coup for Southern California that &quot;will cement California&#x27;s global, economic, scientific and technical dominance into the 22nd century and beyond,&quot; said Gov. Gavin Newsom.

                              <span>The research publisher Science announced today that all of its journals will begin using commercial software that automates the process of detecting improperly manipulated images. From a report: The move comes many years into our awareness that the transition to digital data and publishing has made it comically easy to commit research fraud by altering images. While the move is a significant first step, it&#x27;s important to recognize the software&#x27;s limitations. While it will catch some of the most egregious cases of image manipulation, enterprising fraudsters can easily avoid being caught if they know how the software operates. Which, unfortunately, we feel compelled to describe (and, to be fair, the company that has developed the software does so on its website). 

Much of the image-based fraud we&#x27;ve seen arises from a dilemma faced by many scientists: It&#x27;s not a problem to run experiments, but the data they generate often isn&#x27;t the data you want. Maybe only the controls work, or maybe the experiments produce data that is indistinguishable from controls. For the unethical, this doesn&#x27;t pose a problem since nobody other than you knows what images come from which samples. It&#x27;s relatively simple to present images of real data as something they&#x27;re not. To make this concrete, we can look at data from a procedure called a western blot, which uses antibodies to identify specific proteins from a complex mixture that has been separated according to protein size. Typical western blot data looks like the image at right, with the darkness of the bands representing proteins that are present at different levels in different conditions.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Both of Microsoft&#x27;s current Xbox consoles now have kitchen appliance counterparts. The Xbox Series S toaster recently debuted, following up the Xbox Series X refrigerator. It&#x27;s available for purchase from Walmart for $39.99. In place of its ability to connect to a TV and play games, it can toast bread or bagels, imprinting the Xbox logo onto its side with its internal heat coils. The Series S toaster has a slot long enough to fit two slices of bread side by side, which I suppose can be considered multiplayer support if the bread is for two people. As with most toasters, this one has different toast browning levels, a removeable crumb tray, a bread ejection function, and automatic shutoff.

From a report: San Francisco-based Orrick, Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe said last week that hackers stole the personal information and sensitive health data of more than 637,000 data breach victims from a file share on its network during an intrusion in March 2023. Orrick works with companies that are hit by security incidents, including data breaches, to handle regulatory requirements, such as obtaining victims&#x27; information in order to notify state authorities and the individuals affected. In a series of data breach notification letters sent to affected individuals, Orrick said the hackers stole reams of data from its systems that pertain to security incidents at other companies, during which Orrick served as legal counsel.

                              <span>A consumer action group is accusing Starbucks of exploiting customers via its gift card and app payments, forcing them to enter a spending cycle where they will never be able to fully spend the remaining balance of prepaid amounts. From a report: The Washington Consumer Protection Coalition, a self-described &quot;movement of everyday consumers advocating for corporate accountability,&quot; is calling on the state attorney general to investigate whether the company&#x27;s policies violate consumer protection laws. 

&quot;Starbucks rigs its payment platform so consumers are encouraged to leave unspent money on their cards and apps,&quot; said Chris Carter, campaign manager for the group, in a statement. &quot;A few dollars here and there left on a payment platform may not sound like a lot but it adds up. Over the last five years Starbucks has claimed nearly $900 million in unspent gift card and app money as corporate revenue, boosting corporate profits and inflating executive bonuses.&quot; 

[...] The group, in a 15-page complaint, alleges the platforms for Starbucks&#x27; mobile app and digital payment cards are akin to an &quot;involuntary subscription.&quot; Customers can only reload money in $5 increments, with a $10 minimum purchase. That, the group says, prevents customers from ever reaching a zero balance, meaning Starbucks pockets more of the customer&#x27;s money. The Coalition does concede that customers can reload their accounts in stores for a custom amount of $5 or more, making it easier to hit a zero balance.

                              <span>All new cars and vans bought in the UK must be zero emission by 2035, according to the latest legal mandate updated this week. From a report: The date for all new petrol and diesel cars to be banned was originally set for 2030. However, in September, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pushed this date back to 2035. The government says this is giving consumers more time to make the switch and deal with the UK&#x27;s charging infrastructure. 

The transition will still be challenging. Eighty percent of new cars and 70 percent of new vans sold in Great Britain must be zero emission by 2030, increasing to 100 percent by 2035. While the government points to statistics indicating a 41 percent increase in zero-emission vehicles registered for the first time -- note, the vast majority of newly registered vehicles still remain conventionally powered -- charging infrastructure is an altogether different story. The government boasts of more than 50,000 public charge points, an increase of 44 percent year on year, but not all chargers are born equal. According to research from RAC, a local roadside assistance business, the government has failed to meet its target of having six or more rapid or ultra-rapid electric vehicle chargers at every motorway service area in England.

                              <span>Germany&#x27;s emissions hit a 70-year low last year as Europe&#x27;s largest economy reduced its reliance on coal. From a report: A study by the thinktank Agora Energiewende found that Germany emitted 673m tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2023, 73m tonnes fewer than in 2022. The drop was &quot;largely attributable to a strong decrease in coal power generation,&quot; Agora said, accounting for a reduction of 46m tonnes in CO2 emissions. Emissions from industry fell significantly, largely due to a decline in production by energy-intensive companies. 

Electricity generation from renewable sources was more than 50% of the total in 2023 for the first time, while coal&#x27;s share dropped to 26% from 34%, according to the federal network agency. Germany had resorted to coal following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, when Moscow cut off gas supplies. But since then Germany has significantly reduced its use of the fossil fuels.

                              <span>LG says it developed a 27-inch OLED gaming monitor that can reach an incredibly high 480Hz refresh rate, promising to usher in an &quot;era of OLEDs featuring ultra-high refresh rates,&quot; LG says. From a report: LG says it achieved the 480Hz rate on a QHD 2,560-by-1,440-resolution display. Other vendors, including Alienware and Asus, have also introduced PC monitors that can hit 500Hz. But they did so using IPS or TN panels at a lower 1920-by-1080 resolution. OLED panels, on the other hand, are known for offering stunning color contrasts, and true blacks, resulting in top-notch picture quality. 

The 480Hz refresh rate will be overkill for the average gamer. But the ultra-high refresh rate could appeal to competitive players, where latency and smooth gameplay matters. LG adds that the 27-inch OLED monitor features a 0.03-millisecond response time. The OLED panel should also be easier on the eyes during long playthroughs. &quot;The company&#x27;s Gaming OLEDs emit the lowest level of blue light in the industry and approximately half the amount emitted by premium LCDs,&quot; LG says. &quot;This reduction in blue light not only minimizes eye fatigue but also eliminates flickers, providing gamers with more comfortable and enjoyable gaming sessions.&quot;

                              <span>Several prominent museums have been unable to display their collections online since a cyberattack hit a prominent technological service provider that helps hundreds of cultural organizations show their works digitally and manage internal documents. From a report: The Museum of Fine Arts Boston, the Rubin Museum of Art in New York and the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas were among the institutions confirming that their systems have experienced outages in recent days. The service provider, Gallery Systems, said in a recent message to clients, which was obtained by The New York Times, that it had noticed a problem on Dec. 28, when computers running its software became encrypted and could no longer operate. 

&quot;We immediately took steps to isolate those systems and implemented measures to prevent additional systems from being affected, including taking systems offline as a precaution,&quot; the company said in the message. &quot;We also launched an investigation and third-party cybersecurity experts were engaged to assist. In addition, we notified law enforcement.&quot; Signs of disruption were evident on several museum websites because eMuseum, a tool that usually lets visitors search online collections, was down. There was also disruption behind the scenes: Some curators said that they had returned from their winter vacations to find themselves unable to access sensitive information from another Gallery Systems program called TMS. That system can include the names of donors, loan agreements, provenance records, shipping information and storage locations of priceless artworks.

                              <span>Perplexity, a startup going after Google&#x27;s dominant position in web search, has won backing from Jeff Bezos and venture capitalists betting that artificial intelligence will upend the way people find information online. From a report: Started less than two years ago, Perplexity has fewer than 40 employees and is based out of a San Francisco co-working space. The company&#x27;s product, which it calls an answer engine, is used by about 10 million people monthly. Those ingredients were enough to persuade Institutional Venture Partners, Bezos and other tech executives to invest $74 million in the company, the largest sum raised by an internet search startup in recent years. The investment valued Perplexity at $520 million, including the new money, said Chief Executive Officer Aravind Srinivas. 

Amazon.com, the e-commerce company chaired by Bezos, has committed to investing billions in Anthropic, the AI startup behind the chatbot Claude. The path to competing with Google is littered with carcasses, and Microsoft itself has struggled for years to dislodge the company&#x27;s roughly 90% market share in online search. Others, including tech giants, are incorporating AI into their search engines. Perplexity&#x27;s founders said their advantage is using advances in AI to provide direct answers, instead of website links, in response to search queries, without some of the limitations felt by larger companies.

                              <span>Honda and Mitsubishi are collaborating in a two-year project in Shunan City, Japan, to evaluate the feasibility and environmental benefits of powering a data center with fuel cells taken from electric vehicles. The Register reports: Hydrogen for the fuel cell power station will be provided by a third Japanese company, Tokuyama Corporation, as a byproduct from its salt water electrolysis business, which manufactures about 50,000 tons of sodium hypochlorite each year. The project was proposed by Japan&#x27;s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), which promotes the research, development and adoption of industrial, energy and environmental technologies. The objective is to consider ways of reducing costs for organizations to install and operate stationary fuel cell systems, which could ultimately contribute to the decarbonization of the electric power supply. No details were disclosed of the kind of datacenter infrastructure that Mitsubishi will operate as part of this project, so it is unknown how much power the fuel cell power station will be required to supply. [...]
 
Hydrogen can be considered a clean fuel because it produces only water as a byproduct when consumed in a fuel cell. But the problem is in sourcing the hydrogen. Much commercially produced hydrogen is extracted from methane gas via an energy-intensive process typically powered by fossil fuels. It is likely that the process Tokuyama uses in its salt water electrolysis is ultimately powered by fossil fuels, but the hydrogen is produced as a byproduct and this is currently just a demonstration project to evaluate the feasibility of integrated hydrogen business models. In addition to verifying the use of fuel cells for primary and backup power sources in datacenters, the project will also look at the potential for grid-balancing applications.

                              <span>Denmark has long ranked high on the list of societies that American liberals dream about turning the United States into. And for many good reasons. Education is state-funded, and students are even paid a stipend to go to university. Health care is equally free of individual charge, and there’s generally a robust social safety net for unemployment, maternity leave, and the like. Not to mention the fact that Copenhagen is one of the most enthusiastic biking cities in the world, as well as being one of the very safest. There’s a lot to love about Denmark, and I do.
But to pine for a society like the Danish purely on the basis of the benefits is delusional. These benefits are fenced by a myriad of compromises and obligations. The fawning, superficial adoration that American liberals usually be…</span>

                              <span>Programmers at large seem eternally skeptical of style. And I’m not just talking about the stereotype of nerds in uncoordinated outfits or using pocket protectors. But style in the broad sense of aesthetics. Many appear imbued with fundamental opposition to the idea that how something looks should even matter. That somehow such a focus is conflict with where it ought to be: on substance. This is very apparent in the discussion about linting code.
Linting is a term for applying a consistent style to source code. Like following Strunk &amp; White’s grammatical guidelines for prose, but automatically enforced by a linting program. It’s a technique that’s been around for a long time, but one that’s seen broader adoption with the advent of cloud-based continuous integration setups, which run tests,…</span>

                              <span>When working with a legacy system it is valuable to identify and create seams:
  places where we can alter the behavior of the system without editing
  source code. Once we&#x27;ve found a seam, we can use it to break dependencies to
  simplify testing, insert probes to gain observability, and redirect program
  flow to new modules as part of legacy displacement.
Micheal Feathers coined the term “seam” in the context of legacy systems in
  his book Working Effectively with Legacy Code. His definition: “a seam is a place
  where you can alter behavior in your program without editing in that place”.
Here&#x27;s an example of where a seam would be handy. Imagine some code to
  calculate the price of an order.
// TypeScript
export async function calculatePrice(order:Order) {

I have to say, I&#x27;ve found no greater professional joy than working with a tight group of people to ship and support our own products. And for those products to find people willing to trade their own hard earned treasure for a little bit of ours.
Betting on an idea — and seeing it through — is enormously fulfilling. The creative and intellectual stimulation is beyond compare. Especially when you&#x27;re the first customer for anything you make.
When I was a consultant doing work for hire I thought it was the peak. I got to bounce from client to client, sign big contracts, do a lot of work, cash large checks, etc. But then you realize most of what you do is never implemented. Yes, you got paid for it, but it was just advice, recommendations, and suggestions. Words on pages that were received, but not really read. Designs in files that were delivered, but never really deployed. There was nothing there in the end. You didn&#x27;t get to make any bets, you just played with someone else&#x27;s chips.
You thought you were changing things. Changing them. But it wasn&#x27;t change, it was an exchange. You handed it over, they handed you something in return, and that was that.
I&#x27;m glad I went through it, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have known it.
Been giving other people advice for years? Give yourself the advice and see if it&#x27;s any good. Meet the market.
Go make something. Join a team that&#x27;s making something. Put your fingerprint on something that won&#x27;t just sit on the shelf somewhere.

                              <span>Alexander Martin reports via The Record: The owner of an apartment in Veliky Novgorod in Russia has been arrested for discrediting the country&#x27;s armed forces after a neighbor alerted the police to the message &#x27;Slava Ukraini&#x27; scrolling across their LED curtains. When police went to the scene, they saw the garland which the owner had hung in celebration of the New Year and a &quot;slogan glorifying the Armed Forces of Ukraine,&quot; as a spokesperson for the Ministry of Internal Affairs told state-owned news agency TASS. The apartment owner said the garland was supposed to display a &quot;Happy New Year&quot; greeting, TASS reported.
 
Several other people in Russia described a similar experience on the AlexGyver web forum, linked to a DIY blog popular in the country. They said at the stroke of midnight on New Year&#x27;s Eve, their LED curtains also began to show the &quot;Glory to Ukraine&quot; message in Ukrainian. It is not clear whether any of these other posters were also arrested. The man in Veliky Novgorod will have to defend his case in court, according to TASS. Police have seized the curtain itself.
 
An independent investigation into the cause of the message by the AlexGyver forum users found that affected curtains all used the same open-source firmware code. The original code appears to have originated in Ukraine before someone created a fork translated into Russian. According to the Telegram channel for AlexGyver, the code had been added to the original project on October 18, and then in December the people or person running the fork copied and pasted that update into their own version. &quot;Everyone who downloaded and updated the firmware in December received a gift,&quot; the Telegram channel wrote. The message was &quot;really encrypted, hidden from the &#x27;reader&#x27; of the code, and is displayed on the first day of the year exclusively for residents of Russia by [geographic region].&quot;

                              <span>A federal criminal complaint has revealed that state and local agencies in New Jersey bought millions of dollars worth of banned Chinese surveillance cameras. The cameras were purchased from a local company that rebranded the banned equipment made by Dahua Technology, a company that has been implicated in the surveillance of the Uyghur people in Xinjiang. According to 404 Media, &quot;At least $15 million of the equipment was bought using federal COVID relief funds.&quot; From the report: The feds charged Tamer Zakhary, the CEO of the New Jersey-based surveillance company Packetalk, with three counts of wire fraud and a separate count of false statements for repeatedly lying to state and local agencies about the provenance of his company&#x27;s surveillance cameras.

                              <span>smooth wombat writes: The advent of streaming services heralded a new era of movie watching. No longer tied to an inconvenient time at a theater, movies could now be watched at your convenience any time of the day or night in your own home. However, with that convenience comes a sinister side: those same movies disappearing from streaming services. Once the movie is removed from the streaming service you can&#x27;t watch it again. As a result, more people, particularly younger people, are buying DVDs, and even records, to preserve their ability to watch and listen to what they want when they want. Before his release of Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan encouraged fans to embrace &quot;a version you can buy and own at home and put on a shelf so no evil streaming service can come steal it from you&quot;. From the BBC article:

 
Other directors have chimed in to sing the praises of physical media. James Cameron told Variety:&quot;The streamers are denying us any access whatsoever to certain films. And I think people are responding with their natural reaction, which is &#x27;I&#x27;m going to buy it, and I&#x27;m going to watch it any time I want.&#x27;&quot; Guillermo del Toro posted on X that &quot;If you own a great 4K HD, Blu-ray, DVD etc etc of a film or films you love... you are the custodian of those films for generations to come.&quot; His tweet prompted people to reply, sharing evidence of their vast DVD collections.

From a report: Even though LastPass has repeatedly said that there is a 12-character master password requirement since 2018, users have had the ability to use a weaker one. &quot;Historically, while a 12-character master password has been LastPassâ(TM) default setting since 2018, customers still had the ability to forego the recommended default settings and choose to create a master password with fewer characters, if they wished to do so,&quot; LastPass said in a new announcement today. 

LastPass has begun enforcing a 12-character master password requirement since April 2023 for new accounts or password resets, but older accounts could still use passwords with fewer than 12 characters. Starting this month, LastPass is now enforcing the 12-character master password requirement for all accounts. Furthermore, LastPass added that it will also start checking new or updated master passwords against a database of credentials previously leaked on the dark web to ensure that they don&#x27;t match already compromised accounts.

From a report: In announcing the cuts, Xerox said Wednesday it is adopting a new operating model and organizational structure aimed at boosting its core print business, while also forming a new business services unit. CEO Steven Bandrowczak said in a statement that the shift will enhance the company&#x27;s ability to efficiently bring products and services to market, labeling the strategic pivot at Xerox a &quot;reinvention.&quot; As of October 2023, Xerox had roughly 20,000 employees, according to the company&#x27;s website.

                              <span>John Walker, reporting for Kotaku: Steam is by far the most peculiar of online storefronts. Built on top of itself for the last twenty years, Valve&#x27;s behemothic PC game distributor is a clusterfuck of overlapping design choices, where algorithms rule over coherence, with 2023 seeing over 14,500 games released into the mayhem. Which is too many games. That breaks down to just under 40 a day, although given how people release games, it more accurately breaks down to about 50 every weekday. 50 games a day. On a storefront that goes to some lengths to bury new releases, and even buries pages where you can deliberately list new releases. 

Compared to 2022, that&#x27;s an increase of nearly 2,000 games, up almost 5,000 from five years ago. There&#x27;s no reason to expect that growth to diminish any time soon. It&#x27;s a volume of games that not only could no individual ever hope to keep up with, but nor could even any gaming site. Not even the biggest sites in the industry could afford an editorial team capable of playing 50 games a day to find and write about those worth highlighting. Realistically, not even a tenth of the games. And that&#x27;s not least because of those 50 games per day, about 48 of them will be absolute dross. On one level, in this way Steam represents a wonderful democracy for gaming, where any developer willing to stump up the $100 entry fee can release their game on the platform, with barely any restrictions. On another level, however, it&#x27;s a disaster for about 99 percent of releases, which stand absolutely no chance of garnering any attention, no matter their quality. The solution: human storefront curation, which Valve has never shown any intention of doing.

                              <span>Intuit is being questioned by US lawmakers who say federal tax credits the company received could have been better spent to build a free government alternative to Intuit&#x27;s popular online tax preparation software, TurboTax. From a report: &quot;For years, Intuit&#x27;s corporate lobbyists have argued that the federal government should not set up a program for Americans to file their taxes online and for free because it would be too costly for taxpayers,&quot; the lawmakers, including Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, wrote in a letter to the company. &quot;Your company&#x27;s disclosure reveals that Intuit&#x27;s research tax break from 2022 alone could have been enough to fund a year of a free e-File program for millions of Americans.&quot; 

The lawmakers asked Intuit to provide details on its research expenses dating to 2018. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, and Sanders, an Independent from Vermont, were joined on the letter by Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, and Representative Katie Porter, a Democrat from California. The Internal Revenue Service, in a report to Congress last year, estimated it would cost $64 million to $249 million annually for the agency to run a free-filing program. In the fiscal year ending in July 2023, Mountain View, California-based Intuit received $106 million in federal research and experimentation credits, which amounted to about 4% of its total R&amp;D expenses, according to a regulatory filing.

                              <span>Montana and North Carolina have joined a growing list of states that now require identification to view porn, or are blocked from viewing it altogether, as new age verification laws went into effect on January 1. From a report: A year ago, Louisiana paved the way for a wave of age verification laws that target porn sites; eight states have since passed copycat age verification laws of their own. Montana&#x27;s SB 544 and North Carolina&#x27;s HB 8 are nearly identical to Louisiana&#x27;s and other states&#x27; laws. The laws&#x27; text make unsubstantiated claims about the addictive potential of pornography and its apparent harms to viewers&#x27; health. North Carolina&#x27;s law was passed as part of unrelated legislation that adds a computer science course to high school graduation requirements. Rather than try to make its users jump through hoops to view its content, Pornhub&#x27;s parent company has blocked viewers in Montana and North Carolina altogether, as it has in other states with similar legislation.

                              <span>LG touts AI for its 2024 OLED TVs, but don&#x27;t expect AI assistants onscreen. The Alpha 11 processor in LG&#x27;s new G4 and M4 series aims to sharpen clarity, color and image quality. The G4 features LG&#x27;s Micro Lens Array technology for enhanced brightness. The M4 adopts 2023&#x27;s wireless connectivity to eliminate unsightly cables. The Verge adds: So the AI supposedly now understands creative intent, according to LG, and can adjust your TV&#x27;s image settings accordingly. Picture purists can always ignore and disable these AI modes, but many people inevitably leave them on -- so if the upgrades are noticeable, they&#x27;ll be a difference maker for those customers.

From a report: In the spring, Roku will roll out 55-inch, 65-inch and 75-inch Pro Series TVs that will cost consumers as much as $1,500. The new televisions put Roku in competition with Samsung and LG, which offer several models in that price range. It&#x27;s a step up from the company&#x27;s current TVs -- the Select and Plus -- which top out at $999. [...] The new TVs include a thinner design with a flat back for mounting on walls, improved picture quality and better audio for cinematic sound, the San Jose, California-based company said in a statement.

If the problem persists, try restarting your app or contacting support.&quot; Closing and reopening the app will not work. There is no point in contacting support either. That&#x27;s because on December 31, 2023, Wickr Me, the free version of Wickr, was shut down entirely. 

Wickr Me is no longer available to download on the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store. The app stopped accepting new users more than a year ago. And now, even current users cannot speak to one another. So ends the story of an app that while never reaching the popularity of other encrypted messaging apps like Signal, nor those that later turned on end-to-end encryption for the masses like WhatsApp, nonetheless played an important role in the adoption of and debate around secure communications.

From a report: When fossil hunters unearthed the remains of a dinosaur from the hills of eastern Montana five years ago, they carried several key characteristics of a Tyrannosaurus rex: a pair of giant legs for walking, a much smaller pair of arms for slashing prey, and a long tail stretching behind it. But unlike a full-grown T. rex, which would be about the size of a city bus, this dinosaur was more like the size of a pickup truck. The specimen, which is now listed for sale for $20 million at an art gallery in London, raises a question that has come to obsess paleontologists: Is it simply a young T. rex who died before reaching maturity, or does it represent a different bu…</span>

                              <span>An issue with Sony&#x27;s projectors caused theater chain Alamo Drafthouse to close theaters entirely on New Year&#x27;s Eve. &quot;As of New Year&#x27;s Day, however, most theaters and most showtimes now appear to be available, with a few exceptions,&quot; reports The Verge. From the report: It&#x27;s not clear what happened. As New Year&#x27;s Day is a holiday, we somewhat understandably haven&#x27;t yet been able to reach Alamo or Sony spokespeople, and not every theater or every screening was affected. That didn&#x27;t stop Alamo from blaming its Sony projectors for what at least one theater called a &quot;nationwide&quot; outage, however.

Even though the term &quot;Slashdot Effect&quot; had already been coined, this was the first time it took down a site. The site owner got a personal call from their ISP, which was later reported in the comments, where he also noted that he was writing a novella called &quot;She Hates My Futon.&quot; Many old timers started reading that, although it&#x27;s never been finished, despite having a Good Reads page, a Facebook page, and several promises that he&#x27;ll complete it.

                              <span>Genuine parts for the Google Pixel 8 and 8 Pro are now available on iFixit&#x27;s Pixel parts store. &quot;The Pixel 8 is the first Google phone with seven years of major OS updates, and Google previously said these parts will be in stock for seven years to match, so the phone sounds like it will be a longevity champion,&quot; reports Ars Technica&#x27;s Ron Amadeo. From the report: The most common replacement will probably be the screen, which costs $160 for the Pixel 8 and $230 for the Pixel 8 Pro. The product described as a &quot;rear case&quot; is the entire aluminum body of the phone, with the rear glass, camera bar, camera cover glass, side buttons, and charging coil. The Pixel 8 version of this will run you $143, while the 8 Pro version is $173. The batteries are both $43.
 
If your camera breaks, get ready for some serious sticker shock: The Pixel 8 Pro rear camera assembly is $200 for the bundled set of three cameras. Interestingly, the Pixel 8 also has $200 worth of camera parts despite having one less camera by skipping the complicated periscope zoom lens. The Pixel 8 parts come in separate pieces: $143 for the main camera and $63 for the ultra-wide. Along with the $43 front camera, a Pixel 8 is $700 and has $243 worth of camera parts!
 
Other than that, there are various small adhesive and thermal strips. There&#x27;s no replacement motherboard available, which is a shame since that&#x27;s probably the first thing that would break from water damage. (Phone motherboards contain your IMEI number used for things like billing and theft blocklisting, and the industry doesn&#x27;t have a good solution for repairing these.) Since the USB port is part of the motherboard, there&#x27;s no official repair method. The Google Pixel 8 Parts store is available here.

For work that was merged before branching for 1.76 beta, it will be in the Beta channel for the next 6 weeks after which it will be generally available.
This is distinct from This Week in Rust in that it tries to focus more on the big picture, rather than individual PRs, and pulls from more sources, like Cargo Team meetings and Zulip.
This is an experiment in finding better ways to be engaged with the community and we&#x27;ll see how well it works and how well we can keep up on it.

The company pitches Link History as a useful tool for consumers &quot;with your browsing activity saved in one place,&quot; rather than another way to keep tabs on your behavior. With the new setting you&#x27;ll &quot;never lose a link again,&quot; Facebook says in a pop-up encouraging users to consent to the new tracking method. The company goes on to mention that &quot;When you allow link history, we may use your information to improve your ads across Meta technologies.&quot;

                              <span>According to NBC, law enforcement in California can&#x27;t ticket driverless cars for traffic violations, thanks to a legal loophole requiring an actual driver in the car. NBC Bay Area reports: An internal memo from San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott, obtained by the NBC Bay Area Investigative Unit, instructs officers that &quot;no citation for a moving violation can be issued if the [autonomous vehicle] is being operated in a driverless mode.&quot; Scott added, &quot;Technology evolves rapidly and, at times, faster than legislation or regulations can adapt to the changes.&quot;
 
While autonomous vehicles in California have received parking citations, the state&#x27;s transportation laws appear to leave driverless vehicles immune from receiving any type of traffic ticket stemming from moving violations. &quot;I think it…</span>

                              <span>In a letter (PDF) citing &quot;strong public interest in a prompt resolution,&quot; U.S. prosecutors said they do not plan to proceed with a second trial of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF). The Register reports: The prosecutors reasoned that much of the evidence that would be submitted had already been considered in his October trial -- an event which yielded a guilty verdict after just four hours of jury deliberation. Although forgoing an additional trial means not holding SBF accountable for conspiracy to make unlawful campaign contributions, additional court dates would most certainly delay a scheduled March 2024 sentencing, as it would require negotiating with The Bahamas regarding terms of extradition.
 
SBF was extradited to the US from The Bahamas, where his crypto exchange FTX was headquartered, in December 2022. While the island nation agreed to extradition on seven out of eight charges, local authorities did not consent to extradition on a charge of conspiracy to make unlawful campaign contributions. US courts were therefore unable to pursue the eighth charge.
 
SBF&#x27;s first trial yielded seven guilty verdicts. Those included two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, two counts of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Together they carry a combined maximum sentence of 110 years. However, even though the campaign finance charge was not pursued, it could be considered relevant in sentencing matters, wrote the attorneys in their filing. The prosecutors&#x27; letter detailed that the sentencing judgment will also &quot;likely include orders of forfeiture and restitution for the victims of the defendant&#x27;s crimes.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Modern fighting games have come quite a long way from their origins in providing accessibility options. Street Fighter 6 has audio cues that can convey distance, height, health, and other crucial data to visually impaired players. King of Fighters 15 allows for setting the contrast levels between player characters and background. Competitors like BrolyLegs and numerous hardware hackers have taken the seemingly inhospitable genre even further. Tekken 8, due later this month, seems to aim even higher, offering a number of color vision options in its settings. This includes an unofficially monikered &quot;colorblind mode,&quot; with black-and-white and detail-diminished backgrounds and characters&#x27; flattened shapes filled in with either horizontal o…</span>

                              <span>Security researchers say info-stealing malware can still access
 victims&#x27; compromised Google accounts even after passwords have been changed. From a report: A zero-day exploit of Google account security was first teased by a cybercriminal known as &quot;PRISMA&quot; in October 2023, boasting that the technique could be used to log back into a victim&#x27;s account even after the password is changed. It can also be used to generate new session tokens to regain access to victims&#x27; emails, cloud storage, and more as necessary. Since then, developers of infostealer malware -- primarily targeting Windows, it seems -- have steadily implemented the exploit in their code. The total number of known malware families that abuse the vulnerability stands at six, including Lumma and Rhadamanthys, while Eternity Stealer is also working on an update to release in the near future. 

Eggheads at CloudSEK say they found the root of the exploit to be in the undocumented Google OAuth endpoint &quot;MultiLogin.&quot; The exploit revolves around stealing victims&#x27; session tokens. That is to say, malware first infects a person&#x27;s PC -- typically via a malicious spam or a dodgy download, etc -- and then scours the machine for, among other things, web browser session cookies that can be used to log into accounts.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: A court in Washington, D.C., has been stuck with a tough, maybe impossible question: What does full moon face emoji mean? Let me explain: In the summer of 2022, Ryan Cohen, a major investor in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, responded to a tweet about the beleaguered retailer with this side-eyed-moon emoji. Later that month, Cohen -- hailed as a &quot;meme king&quot; for his starring role in the GameStop craze -- disclosed that his stake in the company had grown to nearly 12 percent; the stock price subsequently shot up. That week, he sold all of his shares and walked away with a reported $60 million windfall. 

Now shareholders are suing him for securities fraud, claiming that Cohen misled investors by using the emoji the way meme-stock types sometimes do -- to suggest that the stock was going &quot;to the moon.&quot; A class-action lawsuit with big money on the line has come to legal arguments such as this: &quot;There is no way to establish objectively the truth or falsity of a tiny lunar cartoon,&quot; as Cohen&#x27;s lawyers wrote in an attempt to get the emoji claim dismissed. That argument was denied, and the court held that &quot;emojis may be actionable.&quot; 

The humble emoji -- and its older cousin, the emoticon -- has infiltrated the corporate world, especially in tech. Last month, when OpenAI briefly ousted Sam Altman and replaced him with an interim CEO, the company&#x27;s employees reportedly responded with a vulgar emoji on Slack. That FTX, the failed cryptocurrency exchange once run by Sam Bankman-Fried, apparently used these little icons to approve million-dollar expense reports was held up during bankruptcy proceedings as a damning example of its poor corporate controls. And in February, a judge allowed a lawsuit to move forward alleging that an NFT company called Dapper Labs was illegally promoting unregistered securities on Twitter, because &quot;the &#x27;rocket ship&#x27; emoji, &#x27;stock chart&#x27; emoji, and &#x27;money bags&#x27; emoji objectively mean one thing: a financial return on investment.&quot;

It is not clear who will be appointed to serve as interim president. 

University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on Gay&#x27;s decision to step down. Gay&#x27;s resignation -- just six months and two days into the presidency -- comes amid growing allegations of plagiarism and lasting doubts over her ability to respond to antisemitism on campus after her disastrous congressional testimony Dec. 5.

                              <span>A 13-year-old has beaten the original NES Tetris, previously thought to be an impossible task, after 34 years. The Gamer reports: The assumption I always had was that Tetris goes on forever and ever until you finally run out of space. While that&#x27;s mostly true, as the game has no story, levels, or any form of progress beyond high scores and increasing speed, you &#x27;beat&#x27; the game by crashing it, AKA reaching the &quot;True Killscreen&quot;. It&#x27;s called the &quot;True Killscreen&quot; because, for decades, it was assumed that level 29 was the Killscreen. 

For context, the longer you play Tetris, the faster the blocks fall, upping the ante as you&#x27;re forced to think in split-second moments about where each piece should drop. The speed caps at level 29, making it near impossible to reach the sides. So, the community believed that was the &#x27;end&#x27; of the game. It isn&#x27;t. The end comes when you reach a level so high, Tetris simply crashes.

                              <span>When a deluge of jobless claims overwhelmed Texas in 2020, the workforce agency deployed AI chatbot &quot;Larry&quot; to field unemployment questions. Larry answered over 21 million queries before being upgraded, but its adoption sparked fears over loss of control. Texas last year established an advisory council to inventory current state AI usages like Larry and consider safeguards against unintended consequences like bias. More than one-third of agencies already use some form of AI, including for job matching, translations and security. From a report: The workforce commission also has an AI tool for job seekers that provides customized recommendations of job openings. Various agencies are using AI for translating languages into English and call center tools such as speech-to-text. AI is also used to enhance cybersecurity and fraud detection. 

Automation is also used for time-consuming work in order to &quot;increase work output and efficiency,&quot; according to a statement from the Department of Information Resources. One example of this could be tracking budget expenses and invoices. In 2020, DIR launched an AI Center for Excellence aimed at helping state agencies implement more AI technology. Participation in DIR&#x27;s center is voluntary, and each agency typically has its own technology team, so the extent of automation and AI deployment at state agencies is not closely tracked. 

Right now, Texas state agencies have to verify that the technology they use meets safety requirements set by state law, but there are no specific disclosure requirements on the types of technology or how they are used. HB 2060 will require each agency to provide that information to the AI advisory council by July 2024.

                              <span>Retired officers and departing defense officials are flocking to investment firms that are pushing the government to provide more money to defense-technology startups. The New York Times: When Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and other top officials assembled for an event this month at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, they walked into a lesson in how the high-stakes world of Pentagon lobbying is being altered by the rise of defense technology startups. Inside, at this elite gathering near Los Angeles of senior leaders from government and the arms industry, was a rapidly growing group of participants: former Pentagon officials and military officers who have joined venture capital firms and are trying to use their connections in Washington to cash in on the potential to sell a new generation of weapons. 

They represent a new path through the revolving door that has always connected the Defense Department and the military contracting business. Retiring generals and departing top Pentagon officials once migrated regularly to the big established weapons makers like Lockheed Martin and Boeing. Now they are increasingly flocking to venture capital firms that have collectively pumped billions of dollars into Silicon Valley-style startups offering the Pentagon new war-fighting tools like autonomous killer drones, hypersonic jets and space surveillance equipment. 

This new route to the private sector is one indicator of the ways in which the United States is trying to become more agile in harnessing technological advances to maintain military superiority over China and other rivals. But the close ties between venture capital firms and Defense Department decision makers have also put a new twist on long-running questions about industry access and influence at a time when the Pentagon is under pressure to rethink how it allocates its huge procurement budget.

                              <span>Mozilla closed out 2023 with a report that dodges its flatlining browser market share and Mozilla.social beta in favor of calls for a faster pace from its highly paid CEO. From a report: According to the company&#x27;s filings, Mitchell Baker&#x27;s compensation went from $5,591,406 in 2021 to $6,903,089 in 2022. It&#x27;s quite the jump considering that revenues declined from $527,585,000 to $510,389,000 in the same period. Despite the executive payout, Firefox continues to trail Google and even Microsoft in desktop browser market share. While it has not suffered any catastrophic losses, neither has it made any significant gains. 

Baker, however, would very much like to speed things up and says in the State of Mozilla report: &quot;The pace is not enough, the impact is not enough.&quot; Unsurprisingly for a technology company, the report is heavy on AI going mainstream where Mozilla reckons it can make an impact in the technology, particularly with regard to open source developers and privacy. Mozilla&#x27;s adventures in AI? The organization says it has 15 engineers working on open source large language models and is working on use cases in the healthcare space. Moez Draief, managing director of Mozilla.ai, said: &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of structured data work in that industry that will feed the language models; we don&#x27;t have to invent it.&quot;

                              <span>Climate change is already beginning to reshape global agriculture. India, the world&#x27;s most populous country, looks particularly vulnerable: not just because of extreme weather, but because of government price controls. Fixing the problem is becoming more urgent, both for India and the world -- because India is a big food exporter, too. But politics makes that very difficult. From a report: In early December, India banned overseas shipments of onions until March in an effort to tame domestic prices. That is on top of export restrictions on rice, wheat and sugar already imposed over the past 18 months. And since India is the world&#x27;s largest rice exporter, second-largest sugar and onion exporter, and a significant wheat producer, the bans are wreaking havoc globally.

That&#x27;s what happened to Jason McDonald when a traumatic brain injury at 16 ravaged his planned destiny of becoming a doctor. Jason painfully rebuilt his ind and body from scratch - relearning to read, write, even speak. 
  A serendipitous discovery of coding ignited a new passion within Jason. He dove into the world of Python, even writing a popular programming book. His is a story of the incredible resilience of the human spirit when faced with life-altering challenges. One that calls us to embrace our own vulnerabilities as gateways to growth.

                              <span>Nikon, Sony Group and Canon are developing camera technology that embeds digital signatures in images so that they can be distinguished from increasingly sophisticated fakes. From a report: Nikon will offer mirrorless cameras with authentication technology for photojournalists and other professionals. The tamper-resistant digital signatures will include such information as date, time, location and photographer. Such efforts come as ever-more-realistic fakes appear, testing the judgment of content producers and users alike. 

An alliance of global news organizations, technology companies and camera makers has launched a web-based tool called Verify for checking images free of charge. If an image has a digital signature, the site displays date, location and other credentials. The digital signatures now share a global standard used by Nikon, Sony and Canon. Japanese companies control around 90% of the global camera market. If an image has been created with artificial intelligence or tampered with, the Verify tool flags it as having &quot;No Content Credentials.&quot;

                              <span>Every large smartphone maker except Apple is betting that &quot;foldable&quot; phones will help revive a lacklustre mobile market, despite the devices still largely failing to attract mainstream consumers. From a report: Foldables, which have a screen that opens like a book or compact mirror, barely exceed a 1 per cent market share of all smartphones sold globally almost five years after they were first introduced. But Samsung has doubled down on the product, investing heavily in marketing this year. In July, the Korean group released its 5G Galaxy Z series. The world&#x27;s largest smartphone manufacturer points to estimates from Counterpoint Research that foldable devices may surpass a third of all smartphones costing more than $600 by 2027. 

Other handset makers such as Motorola, China&#x27;s Huawei and its spin-off Honor are also pinning their hopes on the product helping to revive a market that suffered its worst year for more than a decade. &quot;This is the year people [in the industry] really dived in,&quot; said Ben Wood, an analyst at CCS Insight. &quot;Everybody now is betting on this, except Apple.&quot; The iPhone-maker has yet to show any interest in the category, though patent filings suggest it may one day introduce an iPad that folds in half. Every other big smartphone maker has followed Samsung into the market, including Google&#x27;s Pixel Fold and Chinese alternatives from Huawei, Oppo and Xiaomi.

                              <span>AI represents a mixed blessing for the legal field, U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts said in a year-end report published on Sunday, urging &quot;caution and humility&quot; as the evolving technology transforms how judges and lawyers go about their work. From a report: Roberts struck an ambivalent tone in his 13-page report. He said AI had potential to increase access to justice for indigent litigants, revolutionize legal research and assist courts in resolving cases more quickly and cheaply while also pointing to privacy concerns and the current technology&#x27;s inability to replicate human discretion. 

&quot;I predict that human judges will be around for a while,&quot; Roberts wrote. &quot;But with equal confidence I predict that judicial work - particularly at the trial level - will be significantly affected by AI.&quot; The chief justice&#x27;s commentary is his most significant discussion to date of the influence of AI on the law, and coincides with a number of lower courts contending with how best to adapt to a new technology capable of passing the bar exam but also prone to generating fictitious content, known as &quot;hallucinations.&quot; Roberts emphasized that &quot;any use of AI requires caution and humility.&quot; He mentioned an instance where AI hallucinations had led lawyers to cite non-existent cases in court papers, which the chief justice said is &quot;always a bad idea.&quot; Roberts did not elaborate beyond saying the phenomenon &quot;made headlines this year.&quot;

                              <span>India launched its first satellite on Monday to study black holes as it seeks to deepen its space exploration efforts ahead of an ambitious crewed mission next year. From a report: The spacecraft, named X-ray Polarimeter Satellite, was propelled into an orbit of 350 kilometers from an island near India&#x27;s main spaceport of Sriharikota, off the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, according to S. Somanath, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation. The satellite, weighing about 470 kilograms, will carry out research on X-rays emanating from around 50 celestial objects with the help of two payloads built by ISRO and a Bengaluru-based research institute. 

NASA launched a similar mission, the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer, in 2021 to answer questions such as why black holes spin and build on the findings of its flagship telescope Chandra X-ray Observatory that blasted off more than two decades ago. China&#x27;s National Space Administration launched the country&#x27;s first X-ray space telescope to observe black holes, pulsars and gamma-ray bursts in 2017.

                              <span>Hope Thelps writes: A number of films including the earliest ones featuring Mickey and Minnie Mouse finally enterd the public domain today.

The BBC reports:Steamboat Willie, a 1928 short film featuring early non-speaking versions of Mickey and Minnie, is widely seen as the moment that transformed Disney&#x27;s fortunes and made cinema history. Their images are now available to the public in the US, after Disney&#x27;s copyright expired. It means creatives like cartoonists can now rework and use the earliest versions of Mickey and Minnie. In fact, anyone can use those versions without permission or cost. 

But Disney warned that more modern versions of Mickey are still covered by copyright. &#x27;We will, of course, continue to protect our rights in the more modern versions of Mickey Mouse and other works that remain subject to copyright,&#x27; the company said. US copyright law says the rights to characters can be held for 95 years, which means the characters in Steamboat Willie entered the public domain on Monday, 1 January 2024. Those works can now legally be shared, performed, reused, repurposed or sampled. The early versions of Mickey and Minnie are just two of the works entering the public domain in the US on New Year&#x27;s Day. Other famous films, books, music and characters from 1928 are now also available to the American public.
 They include Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s silent romantic comedy The Circus; English author AA Milne&#x27;s book The House at Pooh Corner, which introduced the character Tigger; Virginia Woolf&#x27;s Orlando; and DH Lawrence&#x27;s Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover.

                              <span>The number of 18-year-olds in Japan totaled a record low of 1.06 million as of Monday, a government estimate showed, as the country continues to grapple with a falling birthrate. From a report: The number of those that have reached Japan&#x27;s legal adult age fell by 60,000 from 2023 and accounted for 0.86% of Japan&#x27;s total population, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications said Sunday. The year 2005, when the new adults were born, had seen the country&#x27;s total fertility rate -- the average number of children a woman is estimated to bear in her lifetime -- fall to a record-low 1.26, later matched by that of 2022.

                              <span>Vizio has agreed to $3 million settlement over allegations it misled consumers on TV refresh rates. The TV maker denies wrongdoing but will cease advertising on &quot;effective&quot; refresh rates. Eligible buyers have until March 2024 to file claims and submit proof of purchase. Settlement includes enhanced one-year warranties. The Verge adds: TV makers often use marketing terms like &quot;effective refresh rate&quot; to refer to motion smoothing features, often called the &quot;soap opera effect,&quot; that are intended to reduce motion blur on modern TVs. Motion smoothing is already controversial enough on its own, but companies like Vizio can be frustratingly casual with refresh rate terminology in their marketing.

                              <span>One of the country&#x27;s most influential courts has asked the nation&#x27;s top securities regulator for its views on an uncomfortable subject: whether audit reports by outside accounting firms actually matter. From a report: The court already ruled that, at least in one case, they didn&#x27;t. That case, where an insurer overstated profits and an auditor signed off on its books, led to an investor lawsuit against the auditor that was dismissed. In its ruling, the court said the audit report was so general an investor wouldn&#x27;t have relied on it. The decision could have broad ramifications for the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees corporate financial disclosures, and for the auditing industry, which charged about $17 billion last year for blessing the books of publicly listed companies in the U.S. 

The ruling, by a three-judge panel of the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, prompted three former SEC officials to tell the court it got the answer wrong. They asked the court to reconsider its decision, noting that the SEC in a previous enforcement case had said that &quot;few matters could be more important to investors&quot; than whether a company&#x27;s financial statements had been subjected to a properly conducted annual audit. The court responded by inviting the SEC to file a brief expressing its views on the former officials&#x27; arguments. The SEC in a court filing said that &quot;the commission has an interest in ensuring its views on this issue are considered by the court.&quot; Its brief is due Feb. 16. The court ruling involved a lawsuit by investors over an audit gone wrong. AmTrust Financial Services, an insurance company, had overstated its profit, and BDO USA, its outside accounting firm, had blessed the numbers.

This March, news broke that the latest artificial intelligence models could pass the LSAT, SAT, and AP exams. It sparked another round of A.I. panic. The machines, it seemed, were already at peak human ability. Around that time, I conducted my own, more modest test. I asked a couple of A.I. programs to &quot;write a six-word story about baby shoes,&quot; riffing on the famous (if apocryphal) Hemingway story. They failed but not in the way I expected. Bard gave me five words, and ChatGPT produced eight. I tried again, specifying &quot;exactly six words,&quot; and received eight and then four words. What did it mean that A.I. could best top-tier lawyers yet fail preschoo…</span>

                              <span>This summer 80 million Americans were experiencing 105-degree heat. And tonight the Washington Post identifies what was unique about 2023&#x27;s weather: &quot;the heat&#x27;s all-consuming relentlessness. 

&quot;It went day by day, continent by continent, until people all over the map, whether in the Amazon or the Pacific islands or rural Greece, had glimpsed a climate future for which they are not prepared...&quot;


Even if its extremes are ultimately eclipsed, as seems inevitable, 2023 will mark a point when humanity crossed into a new climate era — an age of &quot;global boiling,&quot; as United Nations Secretary General António Guterres called it.

                              <span>Slashdot&#x27;s 10 most-visited stories of 2023 seemed to touch on all the themes of the year, with a story about AI, two about electric cars, two stories about Linux, and two about the Rust programming language. 

And at the top of this list, the #1 story of the year drew over 100,000 views...

Linux Desktop Powers Consider Uniting For an App Store Conservatives Bombarded With Facebook Misinformation Far More Than Liberals In 2020 Election, Study Suggests &#x27;sudo&#x27; and &#x27;su&#x27; Are Being Rewritten In Rust For Memory Safety Ask Slashdot: Where Can You Buy a Desktop PC That Makes Linux Easy to Install?

We Need To Shut It All Down&#x27; Truck Thief Gunned Down by Owner After AirTag Gives Away Location Symbolic Wyoming Proposal Urges Voluntary Phase-out of EV Purchases by 2035 

Interestingly, a story that ran on New Year&#x27;s Eve of 2022 attracted so much traffic, it would&#x27;ve been the second-most visited story for all of 2023 — if it had run just a few hours later. That story?

But Long-time Slashdot reader BrendaEM wants to remind everyone that after the announcement of Atom&#x27;s sunset, &quot;the community came together to keep Atom alive.&quot; 

First there was the longstanding fork Atom-Community. But &quot;due to differences in long-term goals for the editor, a new version was born: Pulsar.&quot; 

From the Pulsar web site:


Pulsar [sometimes referred to as Pulsar-Edit] aims to not only reach feature parity with the original Atom, but to bring Pulsar into the 21st century by updating the underlying architecture, and supporting modern features. 

With many new features on the roadmap, once Pulsar is stable, it will be a true, Community-Based, Hackable, Text Editor.
 

&quot;Of course, the user interface is much of the same,&quot; writes the blog Its FOSS, and it&#x27;s cross-platform (supporting Linux, macOS, and Windows). 

&quot;The essentials seem to be there with the documentation, packages, and features like the ability to install packages from Git repositories...&quot;

                              <span>The tech news is chockablock[1] with antitrust rumblings and slow-motion happenings. Through eagle-eyed press coverage, regulatory reports, and legal discovery the shady dealings of Apple and Google&#x27;s app stores are now comprehensively documented and pressure for change has built to an unsustainable level. Something&#x27;s gotta give.
This is the backdrop to the biggest app store story nobody is writing about: on pain of steep fines, gatekeepers are opening up to competing browsers. This, in turn, will enable competitors to replace app stores with directories of Progressive Web Apps. Capable browsers that expose web app installation and powerful features to developers can kickstart app portability, breaking open the mobile duopoly.
But you&#x27;d never know it reading Wired or The Verge.

                              <span>&quot;Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren has asked NASA to delay a scheduled launch to the Moon that could include cremated remains,&quot; reports Arizona Public Radio station KNAU:

Nygren says he recently learned of the January 8 launch of the Vulcan Centaur carrying the Peregrine Mission One. The lander will carry some payloads from a company known to provide memorial services by shipping human cremated remains to the Moon. Nygren wants the launch delayed and the tribe consulted immediately. He noted the Moon is sacred to numerous Indigenous cultures and that depositing human remains on it is &quot;tantamount to desecration.&quot; 

NASA previously came under fire after the ashes of former geologist and planetary scientist Eugene Shoemaker were sent to the Moon in 1998. Then-Navajo Nation President Albert Hale said the action was a gross insensitivity to the beliefs of many Native Americans. NASA later apologized and promised to consult with tribes before authorizing any similar missions in the future.

                              <span>&quot;For several years, thousands more high-earning, well-educated workers have left California than have moved in,&quot; reports the Los Angeles Times:

Even though California has experienced lopsided out-migration for decades, the financial blow has been cushioned by the kinds of people moving into the state: The newcomers were generally better educated and earned more money than those who left. Not now: That long-standing trend has reversed... 
The reversal, largely in response to the state&#x27;s high taxes and soaring cost of living, has begun to damage California&#x27;s overall economy. And, by cutting into tax revenues, has delivered punishing blows to state and local governments. State budget analysts recently projected a record $68 billion deficit in the next fiscal year because of a 25% drop in per…</span>

                              <span>Forbes writes: &quot;I am not sure there could have been a more ignominious end to the DCEU.&quot;

Aquaman 2 opened with $27.7 million domestically, well under half the $67.8 million opening for the original Aquaman. But it&#x27;s the overall box office totals that are especially dire, as the film has made just over $138.5 million worldwide. That is about 12% of Aquaman 1&#x27;s final total of $1.1 billion in 2018, where it is the DCEU&#x27;s highest grossing entry. 

The counter to this is that it perhaps is too soon to run these numbers, as it just came out right? Well, a few extra factors to consider. It is already out in a ton of major markets, so there are relatively few potential surges that can still happen outside places like Korea and New Zealand, which can only add so much. Most importantly Aquaman 2 has already launched in China, where it made $30 million in its opening, again, far below the original&#x27;s opening at $93 million there, doing even worse there than domestically, in context. Aquaman 1 went on to make $292 million in China, a figure Aquaman 2 will not come within a mile of. Next, what DC, and many blockbusters, have been doing lately are these incredibly short theatrical windows, so the clock is ticking quickly... 

Of course this is not exclusive to DC, as we have an extremely direct comparison over at Marvel with The Marvels, which at a $205.6 million global gross, the final figure, that is 18% of Captain Marvel&#x27;s $1.13 billion total. Aquaman 2 has the advantage of being a true sequel, not a team-up piece from other TV shows you theoretically needed to watch beforehand, but it also has the disadvantage of being the last dying gasp of the DCEU coming after a string of other high profile box office failures from Shazam 2 to Blue Beetle. 

There was really no way it was going to avoid its fate, even if it did review well (which it didn&#x27;t, as at 35% on Rotten Tomatoes, it&#x27;s one of the DCEU&#x27;s lowest rated films).

                              <span>Long-time tech entrepreneur Anil Dash predicts a big shift in the digital landscape in 2024. And &quot;regular internet users — not just the world&#x27;s tech tycoons — may be the ones who decide how it goes.&quot;

The first thing to understand about this new era of the internet is that power is, undoubtedly, shifting. For example, regulators are now part of the story — an ironic shift for anyone who was around in the dot com days. In the E.U., tech giants like Apple are being forced to hold their noses and embrace mandated changes like opening up their devices to allow alternate app stores to provide apps to consumers. This could be good news, increasing consumer choice and possibly enabling different business models — how about mobile games that aren&#x27;t constantly pestering gamers for in-app purchases?…</span>

                              <span>While Gentoo Linux is best-known as source-based Linux distribution, &quot;our package manager, Portage, already for years also has support for binary packages,&quot; according to its web page. It notes that source- and binary-based package installations can be freely mixed. 

But now...
To speed up working with slow hardware and for overall convenience, we&#x27;re now also offering binary packages for download and direct installation! For most architectures, this is limited to the core system and weekly updates — not so for amd64 and arm64 however. There we&#x27;ve got a stunning &gt;20 GByte of packages on our mirrors, from LibreOffice to KDE Plasma and from Gnome to Docker. Gentoo stable, updated daily. Enjoy! 
&quot;We have a rather neat binary package guide on our Wiki that goes into much more detail...&quot; the announcement points out. 
The packages are cryptographically signed with the same key as the stages.

                              <span>&quot;Digital twin technology is one of the most significant disruptors of global manufacturing seen this century,&quot; argues Motor Trend, &quot;and the automobile industry is embracing it in a big way.&quot;

Roughly three-quarters of auto manufacturers are using digital twins as part of their vehicle development process, evolving not only how they design and develop new cars but also the way they monitor them, fix them, and even build them... 

Nvidia, best known for its consumer graphics cards, also has a digital twin solution, called Omniverse, which manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz are using to design their manufacturing processes. &quot;Their factory planners now have every single element in the factory that they can then put in that virtual digital twin first, lay it all out, and then operate it,&quot; Dann…</span>

                              <span>Roy Longbottom worked for the U.K. covernment&#x27;s Central Computer Agency from 1960 to 1993, and &quot;from 1972 to 2022 I produced and ran computer benchmarking and stress testing programs...&quot; Known as the official design authority for the Whetstone benchmark), Longbottom writes that &quot;In 2019 (aged 84), I was recruited as a voluntary member of Raspberry Pi pre-release Alpha testing team.&quot; 

And this week — now at age 87 — Longbottom has created a web page titled &quot;Cray 1 supercomputer performance comparisons with home computers, phones and tablets.&quot; And one statistic really captures the impact of our decades of technological progress.
 

&quot;In 1978, the Cray 1 supercomputer cost $7 Million, weighed 10,500 pounds and had a 115 kilowatt power supply. It was, by far, the fastest computer in the world. The Raspberry Pi costs around $70 (CPU board, case, power supply, SD card), weighs a few ounces, uses a 5 watt power supply and is more than 4.5 times faster than the Cray 1.&quot;

                              <span>What would happen if we built a concert venue in near-Earth orbit? A science policy journalist explores the question in the Washington Post:

Forget U2 in the Las Vegas Sphere. Take me to a real concert in the round, where I can float 360 degrees around the stage, watching a guitarist shred from the perspective of a fly and inventing dance moves that Earth&#x27;s gravity would forbid. 

Before you dismiss this as a hallucination, consider that we&#x27;re on the cusp of a new era of space travel. Engineer and space architect Ariel Ekblaw, founder of MIT&#x27;s Space Exploration Initiative, says that within a decade, a trip off the planet could become as accessible as a first-class airline ticket — and that, in 15 or 20 years, we can expect space hotels in near-Earth orbit. She&#x27;s betting on it, having founded a nonprofit to design spherical, modular habitats that can assemble themselves in space so as to be lightweight and compact at launch, much like the James Webb Space Telescope that NASA vaulted into deep space two years ago. 

&quot;The first era of space travel was about survival,&quot; she told me as I recently toured her lab. &quot;We&#x27;re transitioning now to build spaces that are friendlier and more welcoming so that people can thrive in space as opposed to just survive.&quot; There&#x27;s no reason, Ekblaw said, that a concert hall can&#x27;t be one of those structures. 
The article ultimately calls this &quot;an impulse for space travel I can get behind: curiosity about who we are and what more we can create when we reach beyond Earth. This is the realm of not just scientists and engineers but of all kinds of dreamers. It&#x27;s a rendition of space exploration that can engage anyone to imagine what&#x27;s possible.&quot;

&quot;And every year we see new things, or old things in new ways, and I&#x27;ve been set the wonderful task of selecting my favorites and relaying them and their import to you.&quot;

End-of-year lists, especially those displaying astronomical imagery, tend to be splashy and colorful. That&#x27;s understandable, but what they sometimes miss are the more subtle photographs, those that hide momentous discoveries in minor visual details or offer fresh perspectives on familiar objects. They may not leap off the page, but they still have an impact. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve kept in mind while sorting through this year&#x27;s celestial treasure trove. This gallery is by…</span>

                              <span>It was a half a century ago that America passed legislation to protect vanishing species and their habitats — and since then, more than five dozen species have recovered. Just one example: In 1963 only 417 nesting pairs of bald eagles were found in the lower 48 states. But today there&#x27;s more than 300,000 bald eagles, writes USA Today. &quot;[T]hough its future remains uncertain, many experts say it remains one of the nation&#x27;s crowning achievements.&quot; 

But 1,252 species are still listed as endangered in the U.S. — 486 animals, and 766 plants — with 417 more species categorized as &quot;threatened.&quot;

The perils of the changing climate add urgency to calls for increased funding and more protection. In North Carolina, for example, the rising sea steadily creeps over a refuge that&#x27;s home to the sole remaining wild red wolf population. Off New England, warming waters forced changes in the foraging habits of the endangered North Atlantic right whale, putting the massive marine mammals in harm&#x27;s way more often... One in 5 plant and animal species in the nation remain at risk of extinction, says Susan Holmes, executive director of the Endangered Species Coalition. &quot;Loss of habitat and climate change are absolutely some of the most important threats that we have.&quot; 

&quot;We are at what I would say is a pivotal moment with the threats of climate change,&quot; she said. &quot;We have to act faster than ever in order to ensure that these species are going to thrive.&quot;

Americans are on track to buy a record 1.44 million of them in 2023, according to a forecast by BloombergNEF, about the same number sold from 2016 to 2021 total. &quot;This was the year that EVs went from experiments, or technological demonstrations, and became mature vehicles,&quot; Gil Tal, the director of the Electric Vehicle Research Center at UC Davis, told me.... Nearly 40 new EVs have debuted since the start of 2022, and they are far more advanced than their ancestors.

                              <span>&quot;Since the 1960s engineers around the world have been fiddling with a novel type of jet called a rotating detonation engine (RDE), but it has never got beyond the experimental stage,&quot; reports the Economist. 

&quot;That could be about to change.&quot;

GE Aerospace, one of the world&#x27;s biggest producers of jet engines, recently announced it was developing a working version. Earlier this year America&#x27;s Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency awarded a $29m contract to Raytheon, part of RTX, another big aerospace group, to develop an RDE called Gambit. 

Both engines would be used to propel missiles, overcoming the range and speed limitations of current propulsion systems, including rockets and existing types of jet engines. However, if the companies are successful in getting them to work, RDEs might have a much broader role in aviation — including the possibility of helping revive supersonic air travel. 

In a nutshell, an RDE &quot;replaces fire with a controlled explosion&quot;, explains Kareem Ahmed, an expert in advanced aerospace engines at the University of Central Florida. In technical terms, this is because a jet engine relies on the combustion of oxygen and fuel, which is a subsonic reaction that scientists call deflagration. Detonation, by comparison, is a high-energy explosion that takes place at supersonic speeds. As a result it is a more powerful and potentially a more efficient way of producing thrust, the force that drives an aircraft forward... 

By modifying an aircraft&#x27;s fuselage and wings, engineers believe they can reduce the boom&#x27;s impact on the ground below. Such work will help to determine whether or not future supersonic passenger planes will, like Concorde, be restricted to flying beyond the speed of sound only over oceans.

                              <span>TechCrunch argues that in 2023, &quot;established technologies relied on by millions hit a chaos curve, making people realize how beholden they are to a proprietary platform they have little control over.&quot;

The OpenAI fiasco in November, where the ChatGPT hit-maker temporarily lost its co-founders, including CEO Sam Altman, created a whirlwind five days of chaos culminating in Altman returning to the OpenAI hotseat. But only after businesses that had built products atop OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-X large language models (LLMs) started to question the prudence of going all-in on OpenAI, with &quot;open&quot; alternatives such as Meta&#x27;s Llama-branded family of LLMs well-positioned to capitalize. 

Even Google seemingly acknowledged that &quot;open&quot; might trump &quot;proprietary&quot; AI, with a leaked internal memo penned by a researcher that expressed fears that open source AI was on the front foot. &quot;We have no moat, and neither does OpenAI,&quot; the memo noted. 

Elsewhere, Adobe&#x27;s $20 billion megabucks bid to buy rival Figma — a deal that eventually died due to regulatory headwinds — was a boon for open source Figma challenger Penpot, which saw signups surge amid a mad panic that Adobe might be about to unleash a corporate downpour on Figma&#x27;s proverbial parade. And when cross-platform game engine Unity unveiled a controversial new fee structure, developers went berserk, calling the changes destructive and unfair. The fallout caused Unity to do a swift about turn, but only after a swathe of the developer community started checking out open source rival Godot, which also now has a commercial company driving core development.

                              <span>TechCrunch reports:

Apple&#x27;s warnings in late October that Indian journalists and opposition figures may have been targeted by state-sponsored attacks prompted a forceful counterattack from Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#x27;s government. Officials publicly doubted Apple&#x27;s findings and announced a probe into device security. 

India has never confirmed nor denied using the Pegasus tool, but nonprofit advocacy group Amnesty International reported Thursday that it found NSO Group&#x27;s invasive spyware on the iPhones of prominent journalists in India, lending more credibility to Apple&#x27;s early warnings. &quot;Our latest findings show that increasingly, journalists in India face the threat of unlawful surveillance simply for doing their jobs, alongside other tools of repression including imprisonment under draconian laws, smear campaigns, harassment, and intimidation,&quot; said Donncha Ã&quot; Cearbhaill, head of Amnesty International&#x27;s Security Lab, in the blog post.
 


Cloud security company Lookout has also published &quot;an in-depth technical look&quot; at Pegasus, calling its use &quot;a targeted espionage attack being actively leveraged against an undetermined number of mobile users around the world.&quot;

It uses sophisticated function hooking to subvert OS- and application-layer security in voice/audio calls and apps including Gmail, Facebook, WhatsApp, Facetime, Viber, WeChat, Telegram, Apple&#x27;s built-in messaging and email apps, and others. It steals the victim&#x27;s contact list and GPS location, as well as personal, Wi-Fi, and router passwords stored on the device... 

According to news reports, NSO Group sells weaponized software that targets mobile phones to governments and has been operating since 2010, according to its LinkedIn page. The Pegasus spyware has existed for a significant amount of time, and is advertised and sold for use on high-value targets for multiple purposes, including high-level espionage on iOS, Android, and Blackberry.

The numbers started to slide after spring 2020, when more than 60% of days were worked from home, according to data from WFH Research, a scholarly data collection project. By 2023, that number had dropped to about 25% â&#x27; much lower than its peak but still a fivefold increase from 5% in 2019. But work-from-home numbers have held steady throughout most of 2023. And according to remote-work experts, they&#x27;re expected to rebound in the years to come as companies adjust to work-from-home trends. &quot;Return-to-office died in &#x27;23,&quot; said Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University and work-from-home expert. &quot;There&#x27;s a tombstone wi…</span>

                              <span>They create a dedicated desktop icon for your favorite web-based application — a simplified browser that opens to that single URL. Yet while Linux usually offers the same functionality as other operating systems, &quot;Peppermint OS&#x27;s Ice and its successor Kumo are the only free software versions of Site-Specific Browsers available on Linux,&quot; according to Linux magazine. 

&quot;Fortunately for those who want this functionality, Peppermint OS is a Debian derivative, and both can be installed on Debian and most other derivatives.&quot;
Since SSBs first appeared in 2005, they have been available on both Windows and macOS. On Linux, however, the availability has come and gone. On Linux, Firefox once had an SSB mode, but it was discontinued in 2020 on the grounds that it had multiple bugs that were time-consuming to fix and there was &quot;little to no perceived user benefit to the feature.&quot; Similarly, Chromium once had a basic SSB menu item, Create Application Shortcut, which no longer appears in recent versions. As for GNOME Web&#x27;s (Epiphany&#x27;s) Install Site as Web Application, while it still appears in the menu, it is no longer functional. Today, Linux users who want to try SSBs have no choices except Ice or Kumo. 

Neither Ice or Kumo appears in any repository except Peppermint OS&#x27;s. But because Peppermint OS installs packages from Debian 12 (&quot;bookworm&quot;), either can be installed to Debian or a derivative... To install successfully, at least one of Firefox, Chrome, Chromium, or Vivaldi also must be installed... Because both Ice and Kumo are written in Python, they can be run on any desktop. 

The article concludes that Site-Specific Browsers might make more sense &quot;on a network or in a business where their isolation provides another layer of security. Or perhaps the time for SSBs is past and there&#x27;s a reason browsers have tried to implement them, and then discarded them.&quot;

&quot;That may now be changing as the cost of launching satellites falls sharply, solar and robotics technology advances swiftly, and the need for abundant clean energy to replace planet-heating fossil fuels becomes more urgent.&quot;
 There&#x27;s a &quot;nexus of different technologies coming together right now just when we need it,&quot; said Craig Underwood, emeritus professor of spacecraft engineering at the University of Surrey in the U.K. The problem is, these technologies would need to be deployed at a scale unlike anything ever done before... &quot;The big stumbling block has been simply the sheer cost of putting a power station into orbit.&quot; Over the last decade, tha…</span>

Instead they&#x27;re favoring &quot;a more passive experience, surveys of users and research from data-analytics firms say.&quot;



In an October report from data-intelligence company Morning Consult, 61% of U.S. adult respondents with a social-media account said they have become more selective about what they post. The reasons are varied: People say they feel they can&#x27;t control the content they see. They have become more protective about sharing their lives online. They also say the fun of social media has fizzled. This lurker mentality is widespread, across Meta Platforms&#x27; Instagram and Facebook along with X and TikTok....

Monstrous, 20-foot-plus waves on Thursday crashed over seawalls and swept away and injured several people, forced rescues and sent a damaging surge of water through coastal California streets. 

Dangerous waves continued to slam the coast on Friday, forcing beaches to close. All Ventura County beaches will be closed through New Year&#x27;s Eve because of the 15- to 20-foot waves expected along the central and Southern California coasts through Saturday evening...

The foam could prevent or significantly reduce the likelihood of concussion in military personnel and sportspeople. Among sportspeople and military vets, traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the major causes of permanent disability and death. Injury statistics show that the majority of TBIs, of which concussion is a subtype, are associated with oblique impacts, which subject the brain to a combination of linear and rotational kinetic energy forces and cause shearing of the delicate brain tissue.

                              <span>SpaceX on Thursday launched two rockets into orbit, only three hours apart, bringing its total number of launches to 98 in 2023. Space.com reports: The first SpaceX mission to take to the skies Thursday (Dec. 28) was a Falcon Heavy rocket carrying the U.S. military&#x27;s secretive X-37B space plane, designed mission USSF-52. That blasted off from NASA&#x27;s Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 8:07 p.m. EST (0107 GMT on Dec. 29). This marked the second Falcon Heavy flight of 2023. Second up on the launch docket for Thursday, hours later, was a Falcon 9 liftoff carrying 23 SpaceX Starlink units to low Earth orbit from nearby Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. This launch took place at 11:01 p.m. EST (0401 GMT on Dec. 29). This was SpaceX&#x27;s 98th and final launch of 2023, and the 96th flight for a Falcon 9 rocket this year.
 
SpaceX&#x27;s 97th launch overall for this year marked the seventh flight for X-37B, but the first time the space plane hitched a lift atop a Falcon Heavy rocket. The X-37B/Falcon Heavy launch had been scrubbed several times previously due to bad weather and an issue with ground equipment. The launch of 23 Starlink broadband satellites from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida that capped off 2023 was also the 96th launch of a Falcon 9 rocket during this year. SpaceX&#x27;s next launch is targeted for Jan. 2, 2024 and will see a further 21 Starlink satellites lift to orbit to join the over 5,500 internet supplying units currently orbiting Earth.

Aitana is a &quot;virtual influencer&quot; created using artificial intelligence tools, one of the hundreds of digital avatars that have broken into the growing $21 billion content creator economy.

                              <span>Chemists at a lab in Gloucertershire have developed a low carbon jet fuel made entirely from human sewage. James Hygate, Firefly Green Fuels CEO, said: &quot;We wanted to find a really low-value feedstock that was highly abundant. And of course poo is abundant.&quot; The BBC reports: Independent tests by international aviation regulators found it was nearly identical to standard fossil jet fuel. Firefly&#x27;s team worked with Cranfield University to examine the fuel&#x27;s life cycle carbon impact. It concluded that Firefly&#x27;s fuel has a 90% lower carbon footprint than standard jet fuel. Mr Hygate, who has been developing low-carbon fuels in Gloucestershire for 20 years, said although the new fuel was chemically just like fossil-based kerosene, it &quot;has no fossil carbon, it&#x27;s a fossil-free fuel.&quot;

                              <span>Under the old Twitter regime, politics seemed to seep into everything, especially tech talk. There was scarcely a programming or product topic that couldn’t be turned into a struggle session on account of some perceived transgression or privilege. It was, to use the trauma language of those days, exhausting. It also simply seemed like the new normal, something that was going to be that way forever. Thankfully, it wasn’t.
There are plenty of bones to pick with the new regime running X, but perhaps the greatest gift it’s given to the platform is The Rift. The motivation for certain groups of people to find another place to be. Whether that’s Mastodon or Threads or whatever. The tech discourse on X feels like it’s been able to recover its attention in large part because so many of those most interested in keeping it on politics went somewhere else.
Now that’s a lot of “feels”, but that’s because this really is mostly about vibes and individualized algorithms and personal impressions. And to me, the vibe is distinctly vintage. Talking about tech and programming on X today feels like it did a decade ago. Plenty of disagreements, even histrionics, but largely focused on the actual technical topics at hand, not how they might connect to The Current Thing in every which way, all the time.
I guess it’s possible that this shift was going to happen regardless of who ran Twitter or X. That eventually techies at large and programmers in particular were going to tire of the incessant political campaigns anyway. So maybe all the new management did here was to accelerate the inevitable.
But either way, it’s been delightful. And it’s been a good reminder to myself that talking too much about politics, on X or elsewhere, is indeed a limiting prospective. So I’ve gladly turned it down or taken it private. Like the olden days, before we were fooled into thinking that sharing every thought about every hot-button political issue in every social circle was going to advance us all somehow. It wasn’t, it didn’t, and it won’t.</span>

                              <span>After launching a limited beta test in July and a beta version for individual developers in September, GitHub&#x27;s Copilot Chat chatbot feature is now generally available for all users. TechCrunch reports: As of today, Copilot Chat is available in the sidebar in Microsoft&#x27;s IDEs, Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio -- included as a part of GitHub Copilot paid tiers and free for verified teachers, students and maintainers of certain open source projects. Little else about Copilot Chat has changed since the beta. The chatbot&#x27;s still powered by GPT-4, OpenAI&#x27;s flagship generative AI model, fine-tuned specifically for dev scenarios. Developers can prompt Copilot Chat in natural language to get real-time guidance, for example asking Copilot Chat to explain concepts, detect vulnerabilities or write unit tests.

The Financial Times reports (via Ars Technica): Shari Redstone, Paramount&#x27;s billionaire controlling shareholder, has effectively put the company on the block in recent weeks. She has held talks about selling the Hollywood studio to Skydance, the production company behind Top Gun: Maverick, people familiar with the matter say. Paramount chief executive Bob Bakish also discussed a possible combination over lunch with Warner CEO David Zaslav in mid-December. In both cases the discussions were said to be at an early stage and people famili…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from the Associated Press: Social media companies collectively made over $11 billion in U.S. advertising revenue from minors last year, according to a study from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health published on Wednesday. The researchers say the findings show a need for government regulation of social media since the companies that stand to make money from children who use their platforms have failed to meaningfully self-regulate. They note such regulations, as well as greater transparency from tech companies, could help alleviate harms to youth mental health and curtail potentially harmful advertising practices that target children and adolescents.
 
To come up with the revenue figure, the researchers estimated the number of users under 18 on …</span>

                              <span>Microsoft has again disabled the MSIX ms-appinstaller protocol handler after multiple financially motivated threat groups abused it to infect Windows users with malware. From a report: The attackers exploited the CVE-2021-43890 Windows AppX Installer spoofing vulnerability to circumvent security measures that would otherwise protect Windows users from malware, such as the Defender SmartScreen anti-phishing and anti-malware component and built-in browser alerts cautioning users against executable file downloads. 

Microsoft says the threat actors use both malicious advertisements for popular software and Microsoft Teams phishing messages to push signed malicious MSIX application packages. &quot;Since mid-November 2023, Microsoft Threat Intelligence has observed threat actors, including financially motivated actors like Storm-0569, Storm-1113, Sangria Tempest, and Storm-1674, utilizing the ms-appinstaller URI scheme (App Installer) to distribute malware,&quot; the company said.

From a report: The key to a future Wi-Fi you can depend on is something called multi-link operations (MLO). &quot;It is the marquee feature of Wi-Fi 7,&quot; says Kevin Robinson, president and CEO of the Wi-Fi Alliance. MLO comes in two flavors. The first -- and simpler -- of the two is a version that allows Wi-Fi devices to spread a stream of data across multiple channels in a single frequency band. The technique makes the collective Wi-Fi signal more resilient to interference at a specific frequency. Where MLO really makes Wi-Fi 7 stand apart from previous generations, however, is a version that allows devices to spread a data stream across multiple frequency bands. For context, Wi-Fi utilizes three bands-2.5 gigahertz,…</span>

                              <span>Michael D. Cohen, the onetime fixer for former President Donald J. Trump, said in newly unsealed court papers that he had mistakenly given his lawyer bogus legal citations after the AI program Google Bard cooked them up for him. From a report: The fictitious citations were then used in a motion provided to a Manhattan federal judge. Mr. Cohen, who pleaded guilty in 2018 to campaign finance violations and served time in prison, had asked for an early end to court supervision of his case now that he was out of prison and had complied with the conditions of his release. In a sworn declaration made public on Friday, Mr. Cohen explained that he had not kept up with &quot;emerging trends (and related risks) in legal technology and did not realize that Google Bard was a generative text service that, like ChatGPT, could show citations and descriptions that looked real but actually were not.&quot; 

He also said he did not realize that the lawyer filing the motion on his behalf, David M. Schwartz, &quot;would drop the cases into his submission wholesale without even confirming that they existed.&quot; The revelation could have serious implications for the Manhattan criminal case against Mr. Trump, in which Mr. Cohen is expected to serve as the star witness. The former president&#x27;s lawyers have long attacked Mr. Cohen as a serial fabulist; now, they will have a brand-new example.

                              <span>LG just announced its latest 4K projector, the CineBeam Qube. It&#x27;ll officially unveil the projector at CES 2024 in early January, but the company&#x27;s giving curious consumers an early look. From a report: The CineBeam Qube has plenty of high-tech bells and whistles, but with a stylish design that LG calls &quot;minimalist.&quot; There&#x27;s also a handle that resembles a crank. Yeah this thing has an actual handle. The CineBeam Qube is built for portability. It&#x27;s lightweight, at around three pounds, and the square form factor makes it easy to place just about anywhere. The 360-degree rotatable handle also helps with placement. LG&#x27;s calling it &quot;one of the smallest projectors available.&quot; 

Of course, the most important part of any projector is, well, the projection. The Qube projects 4K UHD (3,840 x 2,160) resolution images that measure up to 120 inches. There&#x27;s an RGB laser light source, a 450,000:1 contrast ratio and 154 percent coverage of the DCI-P3 color gamut. With these specs, that episode of Reacher will really pop. Speaking of streaming content, the projector runs on LG webOS 6.0 and offers access to all of the big streaming services, including Prime Video, Disney+, Netflix and YouTube.

                              <span>Daihatsu, the Japanese automaker owned by Toyota, has halted domestic production after admitting it forged the results of safety tests for its vehicles for more than 30 years. From a report: The brand, best known for manufacturing small passenger cars, has stopped output at all four of its Japanese factories as of Tuesday, including one at its headquarters in Osaka, a spokesperson told CNN. The shutdown will last through at least the end of January, affecting roughly 9,000 employees who work in domestic production, according to the representative. 

The move comes as Daihatsu grapples with a deepening safety scandal that Toyota says &quot;has shaken the very foundations of the company.&quot; Last week, Daihatsu announced an independent third-party committee had found evidence of tampering with safety tests on as many as 64 vehicle models, including those sold under the Toyota brand. As a result, Daihatsu said it would temporarily suspend all domestic and international vehicle shipments and consult with authorities on how to move forward. 

The scandal is another blow to the automaker, which had admitted in April to violating standards on crash tests on more than 88,000 cars, mostly sold under the Toyota brand in countries such as Malaysia and Thailand. In that case, &quot;the inside lining of the front seat door was improperly modified&quot; for some checks, while Daihatsu did not comply with regulatory requirements for certain side collision tests, it said in a statement at the time.

From a report: The request comes after the manufacturer discovered two aircraft with missing bolts in the rudder control system, raising concerns about faults across all aircraft. &quot;The issue identified on the particular airplane has been remedied,&quot; Boeing told CNN in a statement. &quot;Out of an abundance of caution, we are recommending operators inspect their 737 Max airplanes and inform us of any findings.&quot; The inspection request entails a two-hour probe of the aircraft&#x27;s safety-critical parts for each of the approximately 1,300 787 Max jets in service, the FAA said.

                              <span>After falsified records for spare aircraft parts set off a frantic global search for suspect pieces, the aviation industry now faces another daunting task: adapting the archaic paperwork for 100 million components to the digital age. From a report: Since the middle of the year, maintenance shops and aerospace manufacturers have found thousands of engine parts with falsified records linked to a distributor called AOG Technics. Airlines from China to the US and Europe have had to pull planes from service and extract the dubious components, leaving jets grounded and racking up millions of dollars in costs. 

The episode has prodded carriers and maintenance shops to bolster scrutiny of their vendors and the parts they receive. And it&#x27;s given fresh weight to an ongoing push to digitize the paper-based records still prevalent in the industry to document the lifespan of every piece of an aircraft from the time that it&#x27;s made to when it lands in a scrap heap. But any structural reforms to thwart would-be copycats of the scheme of which AOG is suspected are likely years away. The industry is accustomed to following standardized methods and only making fundamental changes after a detailed and often lengthy examination of potential safety risks -- and costs.

                              <span>Japan&#x27;s nuclear power regulator this week lifted an operational ban imposed on Tokyo Electric Power&#x27;s Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant two years ago, allowing it to work towards gaining local permission to restart. From a report: Tepco has been eager to bring the world&#x27;s largest atomic power plant back online to slash operating costs, but a resumption still needs consent from the local governments of Niigata prefecture, Kashiwazaki city and Kariwa village, where it is located. When that might happen is unknown. 

With capacity of 8,212 megawatts (MW), the plant has been offline since 2012 after the Fukushima disaster a year earlier led to the shutdown of all nuclear power plants in Japan at the time. In 2021, the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) barred Tepco from operating Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, its only operable atomic power station, due to safety breaches including the failure to protect nuclear materials and missteps that saw an unauthorised staff member accessing sensitive areas of the plant.

                              <span>U.S. Energy Information Administration, in a press release: A new reactor at Georgia&#x27;s Vogtle nuclear power plant is now in commercial operation, according to an announcement from Georgia Power, one of the plant&#x27;s owners. It is the first new nuclear reactor to start up in the United States since the Tennessee Valley Authority&#x27;s Watts Bar 2 was commissioned in 2016. The new 1,114 megawatt (MW) Unit 3 reactor joins two existing reactors at Plant Vogtle, which is jointly owned by Georgia Power and three other electric utility companies. The plant&#x27;s first two reactors, with a combined 2,430 MW of nameplate capacity, came online in the late 1980s. 

Georgia Power expects another similar-sized fourth reactor, Vogtle Unit 4, to begin operation sometime between November 2023 and March 2024. The two new reactors will make Plant Vogtle the largest nuclear power plant in the country, surpassing the 4,210 MW Palo Verde plant in Arizona. Construction at the two new reactor sites began in 2009. Originally expected to cost $14 billion and begin commercial operation in 2016 (Vogtle 3) and 2017 (Vogtle 4), the project ran into significant construction delays and cost overruns. The total cost of the project is now estimated at more than $30 billion.

                              <span>South Korea will start issuing new &quot;digital nomad&quot; visas starting Monday, which will allow some foreign residents to stay for up to two years while maintaining a job back home, officials said Friday. From a report: &quot;To make remote work and vacation of foreigners in Korea smoother, we have decided to launch a new digital nomad visa,&quot; the Justice Ministry said, highlighting the rise of the &quot;workcation&quot; trend, where employees work remotely from a different location. &quot;So far, foreigners were required to apply for tourist visas or just stay for less than 90 days without a visa for workcation in Korea. The new system will allow employees and employers in overseas firms to tour and work remotely in Korea for a longer period of time,&quot; it added. 

Those seeking to apply must submit documents to the Korean embassy in their respective country proving that they earn an annual income of over 84.96 million won ($65,860). The figure is double the amount of Korea&#x27;s gross national income per capita as of 2022, which stood at 42.48 million won. Applicants must submit additional documents including verification of employment, details of their criminal record and proof of private health insurance. They are required to hold private health insurance with coverage of at least 100 million won to ensure the ability to travel back home in an emergency situation. Applicants must also be 18 or older and have worked in their current field for at least a year.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from 404 Media: A group of clowns is suing their former employer Clowns.com for multiple labor law violations, according to recently filed court records. Four people -- Brayan Angulo, Cameron Pille, Janina Salorio, and Xander Black -- filed a federal lawsuit on Wednesday alleging Adolph Rodriguez and Erica Barbuto, owners of Clowns.com and their former bosses, misclassified them as independent workers for years, and failed to pay them for their time. The Long Island-based company, which provides entertainers for events, violated the Fair Labor Standards Act and the New York Labor Law, the lawsuit claims.
 
The owners of Clowns.com didn&#x27;t give employees detailed pay statements as required by New York law, the lawsuit alleges. &quot;As a result, Plaintiffs did not know how precisely their weekly pay was being calculated, and were thus deprived of information that could be used to challenge and prevent the theft of their wages,&quot; it says. The clowns weren&#x27;t paid for time &quot;spent at the warehouse gathering and loading equipment and supplies into vehicles,&quot; or for travel time between parties, or when parties went on for longer than expected, they claim. Pille said she&#x27;s &quot;proud to join with my clown colleagues&quot; to stand up to wage theft and misclassification. &quot;For years, Clowns.com has treated clowns, who are largely young actors with no prior training in clowning who sign up for this job to make ends meet, as independent contractors.&quot;

In an article for Inverse, Raymond Wong provides an in-depth overview of this endeavor, including commentary from Apple&#x27;s marketing managers Gordon Keppel, Leland Martin, and Doug Brooks. Here&#x27;s an excerpt from the report: Gaming on the Mac in the 1990s until 2020, when Apple made a big shift to its own custom silicon, could be boiled down to this: Apple was in a hardware arms race with the PC that it couldn&#x27;t win. Mac gamers were hopeful that the switch from PowerPC to Intel CPUs starting in 2005 would turn things around, but it didn&#x27;t because by then, GPUs started becoming the more im…</span>

But the same features that make them easy to deploy and inconspicuous in your daily life have also allowed them to be abused as a sinister tracking tool that domestic abusers and criminals can use to stalk their targets. Over the past year, Apple has taken protective steps to notify iPhone and Android users if an AirTag is in their vicinity for a significant amount of time without the presence of its owner&#x27;s iPhone, which could indicate that an AirTag has been planted to secretly track their location. Apple hasn&#x27;t said exactly how long this time interval is, but to create the much-needed alert system, Apple made some crucial changes to the location…</span>

                              <span>British households will benefit from improved routes for recycling electronic goods from 2026, under government plans to have producers and retailers pay for household and in-store collections. From a report: Consumers would be able to have electrical waste (e-waste) -- from cables to toasters and power tools -- collected from their homes or drop items off during a weekly shop, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said in a consultation published on Thursday. The ambition is for retailers, rather than the taxpayer, to pick up the tab for these new ways of disposing of defunct, often toxic products safely. The measures are due to come into force in two years&#x27; time. 

Almost half a billion small electrical items ended up in landfill last year, according to data from the not-for-profit Material Focus. This problem was particularly acute during Christmas, when 500 tonnes of Christmas lights were thrown away, the government said. [...] Measures aimed at easing the problem of electronic waste now include requiring larger retailers to create &quot;collection drop points for electrical items in-store&quot; for free, and without the need to exchange this with a new purchase. From 2026 onward, bricks-and-mortar retailers and online sellers would have to collect any broken or rejected large electrical goods including fridges or cookers when they are delivering a replacement product, Defra said.

                              <span>Amazon is making plans to produce hydrogen fuel at its fulfillment centers. The retail behemoth partnered with hydrogen company Plug Power to install the first electrolyzer -- equipment that can split water molecules to produce hydrogen -- at a fulfillment center in Aurora, Colorado. From a report: The electrolyzer will make fuel for around 225 fork lift trucks at the site, although Plug says it has the capacity to fuel up to 400 hydrogen fuel cell-powered forklifts. This is the first time Amazon has tried to make its own hydrogen on site, and it&#x27;s not likely to be the last. &quot;On-site production will make the use of hydrogen even more energy efficient for certain locations and types of facilities,&quot; Asad Jafry, Amazon&#x27;s director of global hydrogen economy, said in a press release announcing the installation of the first electrolyzer yesterday. &quot;Hydrogen is an important tool in our efforts to decarbonize our operations by 2040.&quot; 

[...] Hydrogen produces water vapor instead of greenhouse gas emissions during combustion, a trait that&#x27;s made it more attractive to companies and governments working to meet climate goals. The big problem they need to tackle is cleaning up the process of making hydrogen in the first place. Today, most of it is made using fossil fuels, primarily through a reaction between steam and methane. The process releases planet-heating carbon dioxide. Methane leaks are another problem since methane -- also called natural gas -- is an even more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. Plug tries to solve those problems by using electrolyzers to produce hydrogen. Instead of using methane, it uses electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. If that electricity is generated by renewable sources of energy like wind or solar, it&#x27;s called green hydrogen.

Writing on the company&#x27;s homepage, an official said Zulily&#x27;s leadership had &quot;made the difficult but necessary decision to conduct an orderly wind-down of the business to maximize value for the companies&#x27; creditors.&quot; From a report: Launched in 2010 and based in Seattle, Zulily specialized in children&#x27;s and women&#x27;s apparel. It went public in 2013, and at one point was valued at approximately $9 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal. The retailer was long considered a staple of Seattle&#x27;s tech scene, and in 2019 signed a multiyear sponsorship deal with the Major League Soccer team Seattle Sounders. More recently, Zulily became known for its aggressive advertising across social media platforms. Further reading: &#x27;Office Space&#x27; Inspired Engineer&#x27;s Theft Scheme, Police Say.

                              <span>Google has indicated that it is ready to settle a class-action lawsuit filed in 2020 over its Chrome browser&#x27;s Incognito mode. From a report: Arising in the Northern District of California, the lawsuit accused Google of continuing to &quot;track, collect, and identify [users&#x27;] browsing data in real time&quot; even when they had opened a new Incognito window. The lawsuit, filed by Florida resident William Byatt and California residents Chasom Brown and Maria Nguyen, accused Google of violating wiretap laws. 

It also alleged that sites using Google Analytics or Ad Manager collected information from browsers in Incognito mode, including web page content, device data, and IP address. The plaintiffs also accused Google of taking Chrome users&#x27; private browsing activity and then associating it with their already-existing user profiles. Google initially attempted to have the lawsuit dismissed by pointing to the message displayed when users turned on Chrome&#x27;s incognito mode. That warning tells users that their activity &quot;might still be visible to websites you visit.&quot;

                              <span>Web software firm 37Signals has migrated off the cloud after spending $3.2 million on Amazon Web Services last year, said co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson, who is also the creator of Ruby on Rails. The Basecamp project management software-maker bought $600,000 of Dell servers and expects to save over $7 million in five years by running operations in-house. From a report: DHH likened clouds to &quot;merchants of complexity&quot; where they are incentivized to make things as complex as possible to keep customers hooked. He compared that to the original Internet, which was not built on complex cloud services geared for multi-tenancy, but rather on simpler tools such as Linux and PHP, which anyone could use without cost. This is not to say cloud has zero value for all use cases, [Kelsey] Hightower and DHH agreed. 

Clouds make perfect sense in many cases, for start-ups that do not know how much infrastructure they will need, and also for enterprises with a lack of expertise and money to burn. For many companies in the middle, though a lot of profit margin can be recovered by reducing cloud costs and running things in-house instead, the two argued.

From a report: FIU said it has issued show cause notices to all nine firms. Global crypto exchanges are required to comply with India&#x27;s anti-money laundering rules and cannot evade the guidelines just because they don&#x27;t have physical presence in the country, the government agency said.

                              <span>A recent video poked fun at the newly announced Legend of Zelda movie by referencing the checkered history of video game adaptations. However, 2023 brought critical and commercial success for games-based projects like The Last of Us and The Super Mario Bros Movie, while several comic book films such as The Flash and Ant-Man 3 underperformed. 

This shift comes as Disney CEO Bob Iger admitted Marvel may have oversaturated the market. While caped crusaders aren&#x27;t finished yet, their golden era may be ending. Meanwhile, Mario earned over $1 billion, topping all superhero films this year. Video game movies have struggled in the past, but their time may have finally come.

                              <span>Chinese smartphone giant Xiaomi has revealed its first electric car, a sharp-looking sedan called the SU7. Slated to roll out in China next year, it&#x27;s another entry into an increasingly crowded market for EVs. It&#x27;s also another attempt in this software-obsessed world to match up the technology people find in their phones to what goes on inside their car. From a report: Xiaomi might have a shot. That&#x27;s because the car will run Xiaomi&#x27;s &quot;HyperOS,&quot; a new architecture the company has been working on for more than six years that&#x27;s supposed to be dynamic enough to power everything including phones, smart home systems and cars. The goal is a more seamless experience, one where your apps and preferences are ready to go no matter where you are. 

[...] As for the specs, they look impressive on paper. The company is claiming as much range on a full charge as 800 km, or just shy of 500 miles, though that&#x27;s on China&#x27;s rosy test cycle. That is on the higher-end model, which is built atop a 101kWh battery pack from Chinese giant CATL. A base model with just 73.6kWh of capacity will allegedly get closer to 668 km, or 415 miles, on a charge. They will charge fast (220 km in five minutes) and will be fast (0-100 km/h in just 2.78 seconds). Pricing will come at a later date.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: The Times is targeting various companies under the OpenAI umbrella, as well as Microsoft, an OpenAI partner that both uses it to power its Copilot service and helped provide the infrastructure for training the GPT Large Language Model. But the suit goes well beyond the use of copyrighted material in training, alleging that OpenAI-powered software will happily circumvent the Times&#x27; paywall and ascribe hallucinated misinformation to the Times. 

The suit notes that The Times maintains a large staff that allows it to do things like dedicate reporters to a huge range of beats and engage in important investigative journalism, among other things. Because of those investments, the newspaper is often considered an authoritative source on many matters. All of that costs money, and The Times earns that by limiting access to its reporting through a robust paywall. In addition, each print edition has a copyright notification, the Times&#x27; terms of service limit the copying and use of any published material, and it can be selective about how it licenses its stories. 

In addition to driving revenue, these restrictions also help it to maintain its reputation as an authoritative voice by controlling how its works appear. The suit alleges that OpenAI-developed tools undermine all of that. [...] The suit seeks nothing less than the erasure of both any GPT instances that the parties have trained using material from the Times, as well as the destruction of the datasets that were used for the training. It also asks for a permanent injunction to prevent similar conduct in the future. The Times also wants money, lots and lots of money: &quot;statutory damages, compensatory damages, restitution, disgorgement, and any other relief that may be permitted by law or equity.&quot;

                              <span>Earth is finishing up its warmest year in the past 174 years, and very likely the past 125,000. From a report: Unyielding heat waves broiled Phoenix and Argentina. Wildfires raged across Canada. Flooding in Libya killed thousands. Wintertime ice cover in the dark seas around Antarctica was at unprecedented lows. This year&#x27;s global temperatures did not just beat prior records. They left them in the dust. From June through November, the mercury spent month after month soaring off the charts. December&#x27;s temperatures have largely remained above normal: Much of the Northeastern United States is expecting springlike conditions this week. 

That is why scientists are already sifting through evidence -- from oceans, volcanic eruptions, even pollution from cargo ships -- to see whether this year might reveal something new about the climate and what we are doing to it. One hypothesis, perhaps the most troubling, is that the planet&#x27;s warming is accelerating, that the effects of climate change are barreling our way more quickly than before. &quot;What we&#x27;re looking for, really, is a bunch of corroborating evidence that all points in the same direction,&quot; said Chris Smith, a climate scientist at the University of Leeds. &quot;Then we&#x27;re looking for causality. And that will be really interesting.&quot;

                              <span>Microsoft quietly launched a dedicated Copilot app on Android, giving users a way to access Copilot&#x27;s AI features without the Bing mobile app. &quot;Spotted by @technosarusrex on X, it is now available for download from the Google Play Store, and the app&#x27;s listing suggests it arrived in the marketplace about a week ago,&quot; reports Neowin. From the report: The new Copilot app for Android is not entirely a new thing. At first sight, it looks similar to the Bing Chat app, which still lets you access the same chat features. In addition, you can use Copilot within the Microsoft Edge browser for Android, SwiftKey, Skype, and more. Copilot for Android supports plenty of features (you can also toggle between light and dark themes) that are already available on desktop. You can ask complex questions, generate images using DALL-E 3, draft documents or emails, or just have a casual conversation about anything. In addition, the app lets you turn off or on the recently added GPT-4.

                              <span>Agence France-Press reports: The world of Chinese chess is in uproar over rumors of cheating and a bad behavior scandal that saw the national champion stripped of his title on Monday after a victory celebration ended with him defecating in a hotel bathtub. Xiangqi, or Chinese chess, has been hugely popular for hundreds of years across Asia -- and 48-year-old Yan Chenglong beat dozens of contenders last week to win the title of &quot;Xiangqi King&quot; at a national tournament hosted by the Chinese Xiangqi Association. But his joy was short-lived, with the CXA on Monday announcing that Yan would have his title revoked and prize money confiscated after had been caught &quot;disrupting public order&quot; and displaying &quot;extremely bad character.&quot;

                              <span>The Vision Pro, Apple&#x27;s first &quot;spatial computing&quot; device that costs $3,499, is expected to have a &quot;late-January/early-February&quot; release date, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. &quot;The analyst says that the first wave of Vision Pros are being shipped to Apple in about a month, with total shipments numbering around 500,000 for the full year,&quot; adds TechCrunch. From the report: The company&#x27;s precise target for the year remains an open-ended question. About a month after the device was revealed, reports suggested that Apple has scaled back expectations from around one million to &quot;fewer than 400,000.&quot; Even the updated 500,000 figure is small for a company of Apple&#x27;s massive size and influence. Keep in mind that the company should be shipping more than 200 million iPhones this calendar year.
 
The Vision Pro, however, is widely regarded as the biggest gambit of Tim Cook&#x27;s 12-year tenure as CEO. Not only is it an entirely new category and form factor for the company, it&#x27;s also prohibitively priced, even for customers accustomed to shelling out extra for apple products. Add to that VR&#x27;s decades-long failure to live up to expectations, and you&#x27;ve got a big uphill fight on your hands. Kuo refers to Vision Pro as &quot;Apple&#x27;s most important product of 2024.&quot; Given the years of speculation and all the time and money the company has no doubt poured into the headset, it&#x27;s a tough statement to argue.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Tom&#x27;s Hardware: The 12VO power standard (PDF), developed by Intel, is designed to reduce the number of power cables needed to power a modern PC, ultimately reducing cost. While industry uptake of the standard has been slow, a new slew of products from MSI indicates that 12VO is gaining traction.
 
MSI is gearing up with two 12VO-compliant motherboards, covering both Intel and AMD platforms, and a 12VO Power Supply that it&#x27;s releasing simultaneously: The Pro B650 12VO WiFi, Pro H610M 12VO, and MSI 12VO PSU power supply are all &#x27;coming soon,&#x27; which presumably means they&#x27;ll officially launch at CES 2024. HardwareLux got a pretty good look at MSI&#x27;s offerings during its EHA (European Hardware Awards) tech tour, including the &#x27;Project Zero&#x27; we covered earlier. One of the noticeable changes is the absence of a 24-pin ATX connector, as the ATX12VO connectors use only ten-pin connectors. The publications also saw a 12VO-compliant FSP power supply in a compact system with a thick graphics card.
 
A couple of years ago, we reported on FSP 650-watt and 750-watt SFX 12VO power supply. Apart from that, there is a 1x 6-pin ATX12VO termed &#x27;extra board connector&#x27; according to its manual and a 1x 8-pin 12V power connector for the CPU. There are two smaller 4-pin connectors that will provide the 5V power needed for SATA drives. It is likely each of these connectors provides power to two SATA-based drives. Intel proposed the ATX12VO standard several years ago, but adoption has been slow until now. This standard is designed to provide 12v exclusively, completely removing a direct 3.3v and 5v supply. The success of the new standard will depend on the wide availability of the motherboard and power supplies.

                              <span>Infosys has lost a ten-year, $1.5 billion deal it announced just three months ago in September 2023. From a report: The Indian services giant advised investors of the deal on September 14th, describing it as &quot;a Memorandum of Understanding with a global company to provide enhanced digital experiences, along with modernization and business operations services, leveraging Infosys platforms &amp; AI solutions&quot; with a total client target spend of $1.5 billion over 15 years. 

That announcement included the caveat that Infosys and the unnamed company would have to conclude a Master Agreement to seal the deal. A December 23rd filing revealed that didn&#x27;t happen. &quot;The global company has now elected to terminate the Memorandum of Understanding and the parties will not be pursuing the Master Agreement,&quot; the statement revealed. Infosys&#x27;s annual revenue topped $18 billion last year, so losing this deal won&#x27;t cause massive pain.

                              <span>An appeals court on Wednesday temporarily stopped the import ban on Apple&#x27;s latest Apple Watches, allowing the company to continue selling the wearables. CNBC reports: Apple stopped selling its Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches last week in response to an International Trade Commission order in October that found the blood oxygen sensor in the devices had infringed on intellectual property from Masimo, a medical technology company that sells to hospitals. &quot;The motion for an interim stay is granted to the extent that the Remedial Orders are temporarily stayed,&quot; a court filing Wednesday said.
 
On Monday, the Biden administration declined to pause the ITC ban. Apple filed the appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Tuesday. The company continues to seek a longer stay. The ITC will need to reply by Jan. 10. The stay means Apple may be able to sell the latest models of one of its most important products during the busiest time of the year. Apple Watch sales are reported as part of Apple&#x27;s wearables business, which reported $39.8 billion in sales in Apple&#x27;s fiscal 2023, which ended in September.

                              <span>AstroForge, a private company, wants to mine a space rock, but it doesn&#x27;t want the competition to find out which one. From a report: For generations, Western space missions have largely occurred out in the open. We knew where they were going, why they were going there and what they planned to do. But the world is on the verge of a new era in which private interests override such openness, with big money potentially on the line. Sometime in the coming year, a spacecraft from AstroForge, an American asteroid-mining firm, may be launched on a mission to a rocky object near Earth&#x27;s orbit. If successful, it will be the first wholly commercial deep-space mission beyond the moon. AstroForge, however, is keeping its target asteroid secret. 

The secret space-rock mission is the latest in an emerging trend that astronomers and other experts do not welcome: commercial space missions conducted covertly. Such missions highlight gaps in the regulation of spaceflight as well as concerns about whether exploring the cosmos will continue to benefit all humankind. &quot;I&#x27;m very much not in favor of having stuff swirling around the inner solar system without anyone knowing where it is,&quot; said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Massachusetts. &quot;It seems like a bad precedent to set.&quot; But for AstroForge, the calculation is simple: If it reveals the destination, a competitor may grab the asteroid&#x27;s valuable metals for itself. &quot;Announcing which asteroid we are targeting opens up risk that another entity could seize that asteroid,&quot; said Matt Gialich, AstroForge&#x27;s chief executive.

ArsTechnica: &quot;The exploit&#x27;s sophistication and the feature&#x27;s obscurity suggest the attackers had advanced technical capabilities,&quot; Kaspersky researcher Boris Larin wrote in an email. &quot;Our analysis hasn&#x27;t revealed how they became aware of this feature, but we&#x27;re exploring all possibilities, including accidental disclo…</span>

                              <span>From the depths of the Amazon rainforest to the deserts of Antarctica, huge questions remain unanswered about life on Earth. The Guardian asked leading scientists and conservationists: what is the one thing you would like to know about the planet that remains a mystery? TLDR, the questions/wishes are:1. How many species are there on Earth?
2. I&#x27;d go back 540m years to see the &#x27;biological big bang&#x27;
3. Could some of the smallest life forms help avert climate crisis?
4. What is the full biodiversity of the Amazon or Congo basin rainforests?
5. How do animals influence the functioning of Earth?
6. What will happen to the Gulf Stream?
7. Do universal rules govern how plants and animals evolve?
8. How many humans could Earth support?
9. Which species will adapt to the climate crisis -- and which will not?

                              <span>More workers feeling anxious, stressed or blue have a new place to go for mental-health help: a digital app. Chatbots that hold therapist-like conversations and wellness apps that deliver depression and other diagnoses or identify people at risk of self-harm are snowballing across employers&#x27; healthcare benefits. From a report: &quot;The demand for counselors is huge, but the supply of mental-health providers is shrinking,&quot; said J. Marshall Dye, chief executive officer of PayrollPlans, a Dallas-based provider of benefits software used by small and medium-size businesses, which began providing access to a chatbot called Woebot in November. PayrollPlans expects about 9,400 employers will use Woebot in 2024. Amazon about a year ago gave employees free access to Twill, an app that uses artificial intelligence to track the moods of users and create a personalized mental-health plan. The app offers games and other activities that the workers can play, as well as live chats with a human &quot;coach.&quot; 

The app &quot;allows you to address mental health concerns the moment they arise and can be used as a supplement to your daily well-being routine,&quot; the company said in a blog post. Amazon declined to comment. About a third of U.S. employers offer a &quot;digital therapeutic&quot; for mental-health support, according to a survey of 457 companies this past summer by professional services company WTW. An additional 15% of the companies were considering adding such an offering in 2024 or 2025. Supporters say the mental-health apps alleviate symptoms such as anxiety, loneliness and depression. Because they are available at any time, the apps can also reach people who might not be able to fit traditional therapy into their schedules or can&#x27;t find a therapist who has an opening. Yet some researchers say there isn&#x27;t sufficient evidence the programs work, and the varied security and safety practices create a risk that private information could be leaked or sold.

                              <span>Paying extra for service has inspired rebellions, swivelling iPads, and irritation from Trotsky and Larry David. Post-pandemic, the practice has entered a new stage. The New Yorker: Tips have long provided a convenient way to foist payment obligations onto others. Kerry Segrave, the author of the comprehensive history &quot;Tipping,&quot; identified the gratuity&#x27;s potential origins, in Europe during the late Middle Ages. By the seventeenth century, visitors to aristocratic estates were expected to pay &quot;vails&quot; to the staff. This might have lowered payroll for the estate itself. At least one aristocrat helped himself to some of this new income stream; he threw frequent parties to increase revenues. The system spread. English coffeehouses were said to set out urns inscribed with &quot;To Insure Promptitude.…</span>

                              <span>Apple&#x27;s hiring of a key engineer 10 years ago helped spark a fight that led its watch to be banned from the US. From a report: At about 1 a.m. California time in 2013, a scientist emailed Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook with an irresistible pitch. &quot;I strongly believe that we can develop the new wave of technology that will make Apple the No. 1 brand in the medical, fitness and wellness market,&quot; he wrote in the email, which was later included in legal documents. Some 10 hours after the message was sent, an Apple recruiter was in touch. And just weeks after that, the engineer was working at the tech company on a smartwatch with health sensors. 

A flurry of activity began. Within a few months at Apple, the employee asked the company to file about a dozen patents related to sensors and algorithms for determining a person&#x27;s blood-oxygen level from a wearable device. But this wasn&#x27;t just any engineer. He had been the chief technical officer of Cercacor Laboratories, the sister company of Masimo, which went on to get to the US to ban the Apple Watch. Apple&#x27;s decision to hire this technical whiz -- a Stanford engineering Ph.D. named Marcelo Lamego -- is seen as the spark that sent Masimo&#x27;s lawyers after Apple. While the iPhone maker denies it did anything wrong, Masimo cited the poaching of employees as part of claims that the iPhone maker infringed its patents. The dispute culminated this month in Apple having to pull its latest watches from the company&#x27;s US stores, hobbling a business that generates roughly $17 billion in annual sales. On Wednesday, Apple scored a victory as a U.S. appeals court paused a government commission&#x27;s import ban on some of its popular Apple smartwatches.

                              <span>The tiny Pacific island nation of Tuvalu is grappling with the imminent threats of climate change. Rising seas and increasing storms threaten the fragile coral atolls that are home to 11,000 people. A recent agreement allowing 280 Tuvaluans to migrate to Australia each year moved the nation closer to a managed retreat, but at that pace it would take decades to relocate everyone. 

Tuvalu could be uninhabitable much sooner, according to projections. In parallel, the government is asserting it will maintain its statehood even without land. It also aims to digitally preserve Tuvalu&#x27;s culture and history in the metaverse, as the physical place faces being drowned under rising waters. Tuvalu is strategizing for adaptation while also trying to drive global action on emissions reductions.

                              <span>Hundreds of students from leading UK universities have launched a &quot;career boycott&quot; of Barclays over its climate policies, warning that the bank will miss out on top talent unless it stops financing fossil fuel companies. From a report: More than 220 students from Barclays&#x27; top recruitment universities, including Oxford, Cambridge, and University College London, have sent a letter to the high street lender, saying they will not work for Barclays and raising the alarm over its funding for oil and gas firms including Shell, TotalEnergies, Exxon and BP. &quot;Your ambitious decarbonisation targets are discredited by your absence of action and the roster of fossil fuel companies on your books,&quot; the letter said. &quot;You may say you&#x27;re working with them to help them transition, but Shell, Total and BP have all rowed back.&quot; 

Large oil firms have started to water down climate commitments, including BP, which originally pledged to lower emissions by 35% by 2030 but is now aiming for a 20% to 30% cut instead. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil quietly withdrew funding for plans to use algae to create low-carbon fuel, while Shell announced it would not increase its investments in renewable energy this year, despite earlier promises to slash its emissions. The letter calls on Barclays to end all financing and underwriting of oil and gas companies -- not only their projects -- and to boost funding of firms behind wind and solar energy significantly.

                              <span>I’m going to draw a parallel that isn’t quite straight, but it’s close enough.
It’s between old (analog) cars and new (digital) cars, simple (analog) businesses and complicated (digital) businesses.
Lately I’ve been driving two distinctly different cars. One from 1970, and the other from 2023. They essentially have nothing in common other than that you sit in them, they have four tires that contact the road, and you control them with a steering wheel and pedals.
Some who don’t care much for cars might say that’s everything in common. On paper I can see the argument, but get behind the wheel of both, and go for a drive, and you wouldn’t say the experiences were equivalent. They’re as different as different can be.
The 1970s experience is analog. Your leg strength determines your stopping po…</span>

                              <span>Over the years, I have repeatedly felt like I missed the timing for a
meetup or an IRC group or social media in general. I&#x27;d go to a meetup
every so often but I&#x27;d never make a meaningful connection with people,
whereas everyone else knew each other. I&#x27;d join an IRC group and have
difficulty catching up with what seemed to be the flow of
conversation.
I hadn&#x27;t thought much about this until the pandemic when I started a
Discord group for software
internals and a virtual tech talk
series called Hacker Nights. Since 2021 the Discord reached around
1,500 members and ~20 fairly active members. And the Meetup peaked at
about 300 members with about 10-20 showing up each Meetup.
After the pandemic receded I started an NYC-based book

5-8 active attendees. I ran a virtua…</span>

                              <span>Over the years, I have repeatedly felt like I missed the timing for a
meetup or an IRC group or social media in general. I&#x27;d go to a meetup
every so often but I&#x27;d never make a meaningful connection with people,
whereas everyone else knew each other. I&#x27;d join an IRC group and have
difficulty catching up with what seemed to be the flow of
conversation.
I hadn&#x27;t thought much about this until the pandemic when I started a
Discord group for software
internals and a virtual tech talk
series called Hacker Nights. Since 2021 the Discord reached around
1,500 members and ~20 fairly active members. And the Meetup peaked at
about 300 members with about 10-20 showing up each Meetup.
After the pandemic receded I started an NYC-based book
club over 2 months with about
5-8 active attendees. I ran a virtua…</span>

                              <span>Amazon earlier this year announced plans to start incorporating ads into movies and TV shows streamed from its Prime Video service, and now the company has revealed a specific date when you&#x27;ll start seeing them: it&#x27;s January 29th. From a report: &quot;This will allow us to continue investing in compelling content and keep increasing that investment over a long period of time,&quot; the company said in an email to customers about the pending shift to &quot;limited advertisements.&quot; 

&quot;We aim to have meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers. No action is required from you, and there is no change to the current price of your Prime membership,&quot; the company wrote. Customers have the option of paying an additional $2.99 per month to keep avoiding advertisements.

Fortunately, Microsoft is taking note. As spotted in a recent update to the Windows 11 beta branch, the company is working on a way to reinstall your operating system through Windows Update, and no files are lost in the process. 

The newest update to the Windows Insider beta branch has added a new feature titled &quot;Fix Problems using Windows Update.&quot; The feature is still a work in progress, so it doesn&#x27;t work as it should right now. However, if you&#x27;re on the Windows 11 Insider beta branch, you can see the button for yourself on the Recovery page, among the Windows 11 backup settings.

                              <span>Joe Biden&#x27;s administration last week announced a new proposal aimed at banning logging in old-growth forests, a move meant to protect millions of trees that play a key role in fighting the climate crisis. From a report: The proposal comes from an executive order signed by the president on Earth Day in 2022 that directed the US Forest Service and the land management bureau to conduct an inventory of old-growth and mature forest groves as well as to develop policies that protect them. &quot;We think this will allow us to respond effectively and strategically to the biggest threats that face old growth,&quot; the US agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack, told the Washington Post. &quot;At the end of the day, it will protect not just the forests but also the culture and heritage connected to the forests.&quot; 

The US Forest Service oversees 193m acres of forests and grasslands, 144m of which are forests. In its inventory conducted after Biden&#x27;s executive order, the agency found that the vast majority of forests it oversees, about 80%, are either old-growth or mature forests. It found more than 32m acres of old-growth forests and 80m acres of mature forests on federal land. The land management bureau defines old-growth forests as those with trees that are in later stages of stand development, which typically means at least 120 years of growth, depending on species. The giant sequoias in California, for example, are old-growth trees. Mature forests, meanwhile, have trees that are in the development stage immediately before old growth.

                              <span>Japan is preparing regulations that would require tech giants like Apple and Google to allow outside app stores and payments on their mobile operating systems, in a bid to curb abuse of their dominant position in the Japanese market. From a report: Legislation slated to be sent to the parliament in 2024 would restrict moves by platform operators to keep users in the operators&#x27; own ecosystems and shut out rivals, focusing mainly on four areas: app stores and payments, search, browsers, and operating systems. The plan is to allow the Japan Fair Trade Commission to impose fines for violations. If this is modeled on existing antitrust law, the penalties would generally amount to around 6% of revenue earned from the problematic activities. The details will be worked out this spring. 

The government will determine which companies the legislation applies to, based on criteria such as sales and user numbers. It is expected to affect mainly multinational giants, with no Japanese companies likely to be caught in the net. Apple does not allow apps to be downloaded onto iPhones through channels other than its own App Store. In-app payments also must go through Apple&#x27;s system, which takes a cut of up to 30%. And although Google permits third-party app distribution platforms, it still requires apps to use its billing system. These effective monopolies on in-app payments can lead to users paying more for the same content or services on mobile devices than on personal computers.

                              <span>After promising early dumps of snow in some areas of Europe this autumn, the pattern of recent years resumed and rain and sleet took over. From a report: In the ski resorts of Morzine and Les Gets in the French Alps, the heavy rainfall meant that full opening of resorts was delayed until two days before Christmas, leaving the industry and the millions of tourists planning trips to stare at the sky in hope. But no amount of wishing and hoping will overcome what is an existential threat to skiing in the Alps, an industry worth $30bn that provides the most popular ski destination in the world. 

The science is clear, and is spelled out in carefully weighed-up peer reviewed reports. The most recent, this year, warned that at 2C of global heating above pre-industrial levels, 53% of the 28 European resorts examined would be at very high risk of a scarce amount of snow. Scarce snow has been defined as the poorest coverage seen on average every five years between 1961 and 1990. If the world were to hit 4C of heating, 98% of the resorts would be at very high risk of scarce snow cover. Another study has revealed the way in which snow cover in the Alps has had an &quot;unprecedented&quot; decline over the past 600 years, with the duration of the cover now shorter by 36 days.

Code.org did not reveal what it was charging Byju&#x27;s to use its &quot;free curriculum and open source technology&quot; for commercial purposes, but Code.org&#x27;s 2021 IRS 990 filing reported $1M in royalties from an unspecified source after earlier years reported $0.

                              <span>Intel confirmed it will invest a total of $25 billion in Israel after securing $3.2 billion in incentives from the country&#x27;s government. From a report: The outlay, announced by the Israeli government in June and unconfirmed by Intel until now, will go toward an expansion of the company&#x27;s wafer fabrication site in Kiryat Gat, south of Tel Aviv. The incentives amount to 12.8% of Intel&#x27;s planned investment. 

&quot;The expansion plan for the Kiryat Gat site is an important part of Intel&#x27;s efforts to foster a more resilient global supply chain, alongside the company&#x27;s ongoing and planned manufacturing investments in Europe and the US,&quot; Intel said in a statement Tuesday. Intel is among chipmakers diversifying manufacturing outside of Asia, which dominates chip production. The semiconductor pioneer is trying to restore its technological heft after being overtaken by rivals including Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

                              <span>U.S. President Joe Biden&#x27;s administration on Tuesday declined to veto a government tribunal&#x27;s decision to ban imports of Apple Watches based on a complaint from medical monitoring technology company Masimo. From a report: The U.S. International Trade Commission&#x27;s (ITC) order will go into effect on Dec. 26, barring imports and sales of Apple Watches that use patent-infringing technology for reading blood-oxygen levels. Apple has included the pulse oximeter feature in its smart watches starting with its Series 6 model in 2020. U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai decided not to reverse the ban following careful consultations, and the ITC&#x27;s decision became final on Dec. 26, the Trade Representative&#x27;s office said Tuesday. 

Apple can appeal the ban to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The company has paused the sales of its Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches in the United States since last week. The ban does not affect Apple Watch SE, a less expensive model, which will continue to be sold. Previously sold watches will not be affected by the ban. Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees, stealing its pulse oximetry technology and incorporating it into the popular Apple Watch.

                              <span>Programmer and writer Jose Gilgado, writes about WordStar 4.0, a popular word processor from the early 80s that continues to work reliably well. Famously author George R.R. Martin used the application to write &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire.&quot; &quot;It does everything I want a word processing program to do and it doesn&#x27;t do anything else. I don&#x27;t want any help. I hate some of these modern systems where you type up a lowercase letter and it becomes a capital. I don&#x27;t want a capital, if I&#x27;d wanted a capital, I would have typed the capital,&quot; R.R. Martin said earlier, as we previously covered. 

Gilgado argues that WordStar 4.0 embodies the concept of finished software -- a software you can use forever with no unneeded changes. He adds: Sometimes, a software upgrade is a step backward: less usable, less stable, with new bugs. Even if it&#x27;s genuinely better, there&#x27;s the learning curve. You were efficient with the old version, but now your most used button is on the other side of the screen under a hidden menu. In a world where constant change is the norm, finished software provides a breath of fresh air. It&#x27;s a reminder that reliability, consistency, and user satisfaction can coexist in the realm of software development. So the next time you find yourself yearning for the latest update, remember that sometimes, the best software is the one that doesn&#x27;t change at all.

                              <span>Major streaming services test releasing children&#x27;s content on YouTube and cut back on fare for kids. From a report: Netflix&#x27;s share of U.S. streaming viewership by 2- to 11-year-olds fell to 21% in September from 25% two years earlier, according to Nielsen. Meanwhile, YouTube&#x27;s share jumped to 33% from 29.4% over the same period. That reality is changing major streaming services&#x27; approach to children&#x27;s entertainment, from what shows and movies they make to where they release them. Many are pulling back on investments in children&#x27;s content, and some streamers have started content for young viewers on such platforms as Google-owned YouTube and Roblox. 

[...] Netflix has also slimmed down its slate of animated children&#x27;s originals, opting instead to rely more on third parties such as Skydance Animation, with which it just signed a multiyear deal to do animated films. Now, Netflix is focusing its youth programming resources on bigger swings, such as the animated film &quot;Leo,&quot; starring Adam Sandler, its biggest animated debut ever in terms of views. The eight largest U.S. streamers, including Netflix, Warner&#x27;s Max and Amazon Prime Video, added 53 originals catering to children and families in the first half of the year, down from 135 for the first half of 2022, according to Ampere. That represents a decrease of 61%, compared with a 31% decrease in overall originals across these streamers for the same period.

                              <span>In Brazil&#x27;s Amazon, armed men with a rogue police unit overseeing illegal mining operations intimidated journalists investigating regional violence and trafficking surges. Though Brazil&#x27;s 2023 deforestation decreased, fires and attacks continued as governments deprioritized crime reduction. Illegal mining finances threats to the climate-critical rainforest, yet improving security was absent from the 2023 UN climate summit agenda. With complex criminal networks forging cross-border alliances and violence escalating, addressing this dilemma is pivotal to safeguarding the Amazon and its Indigenous peoples. Nature: Solutions to these multifaceted issues might not be simple, but practical steps exist. Nations must cooperate to guard against this violence. They must support local communities -- by increasing the state&#x27;s presence in remote areas and promoting health care, education and sustainable economic development -- and help them to safeguard the rainforest. For example, Indigenous peoples in Peru and Brazil are using drones and GPS devices to monitor their land and detect threats from violent invaders. 

Indigenous peoples are the Amazon&#x27;s best forest guardians, but they need more legally demarcated lands and protective measures, such as funding for Indigenous guards and rapid response and emergency protocols. In 2022, Colombia and Brazil saw the most deaths of environmental and land defenders worldwide. Developing effective strategies to enhance cooperation between law enforcement and local populations must also be a priority. To prevent irreversible damage to the rainforest and the climate, security in the Amazon must be added to the global climate agenda.

                              <span>Nigeria&#x27;s central bank has lifted a ban on transacting in cryptocurrencies, while saying global trends had shown a need to regulate such activities, the bank said in its latest circular. From a report: The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in Feb. 2021 barred banks and financial institutions from dealing in or facilitating transactions in crypto assets, citing money laundering and terrorism financing risks. Subsequently Nigeria&#x27;s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in May last year published regulations for digital assets that signalled Africa&#x27;s most populous country was trying to find a middle ground between an outright ban on crypto assets and their unregulated use. 

In a circular dated Dec. 22, the CBN said current trends globally have shown there is a need to regulate the activities of virtual asset service providers (VASPs), which include cryptocurrencies and crypto assets. The latest guidelines spell out how banks and financial institutions (FI) should open accounts, provide designated settlement accounts and settlement services and act as channels for forex inflows and trade for firms transacting in crypto assets. VASPs would need to be licensed by the Nigerian SEC to engage in the crypto business.

                              <span>The source code for Grand Theft Auto 5 was reportedly leaked on Christmas Eve, a little over a year after the Lapsus$ threat actors hacked Rockstar games and stole corporate data. From a report: Links to download the source code were shared on numerous channels, including Discord, a dark web website, and a Telegram channel that the hackers previously used to leak stolen Rockstar data. In a post to a Grand Theft Auto leak channel on Telegram, the channel owner known as &#x27;Phil&#x27; posted links to the stolen source code, sharing a screenshot of one of the folders.

                              <span>Occupations with the highest share of workers older than 65 have changed little, data from the past seven decades show. Bloomberg Businessweek: Americans may dream about being able to go off the clock when they reach retirement age, but a good number simply can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t. We compiled data on the occupations with the highest share of workers older than 65, going back seven decades. The job types held remarkably steady over the decades (farmers, tailors and clergy). A few faded out of the data with time -- blacksmiths, furriers and household washers, for instance. The data can&#x27;t fully tell us why people in some professions keep at it longer than others. But we know they&#x27;re largely low-paying jobs, which means workers have likely struggled to put aside money for retirement.

                              <span>The number of people living in California fell below 39 million this year, according to new census estimates, the lowest count since 2015. From a report: California&#x27;s population dipped by about 75,000 from 2022 to 2023, estimates released Tuesday by the Census Bureau shows, with about 38,965,000 million people in the state this year. The state&#x27;s population has fallen since its 2019 peak of 39.5 million, though the annual loss has also slowed each year. Between 2021 and 2022, California lost a net of about 104,000 people, or 0.3%, higher than the dip of 0.2% between 2022 and 2023. 

About 338,000 more people left California for other states than vice versa from July 2022 to July 2023, the Census Bureau data shows. That&#x27;s slightly greater than the 333,000 from 2021 to 2022, and the most of any state. California historically loses more people to the rest of the country than it gains. The state partially offset its domestic loss via international migration, with a net of 151,000 people moving to California from outside the United States. That was the second-highest number of any state, behind Florida, and a 19% increase from 2021-22. And it was the highest total for California since 2015.

                              <span>After thousands of U.S. flights were canceled or delayed over the holidays in 2022, most holiday travelers this year are off to a cheerier start this Christmas. But a few trouble spots were emerging on Christmas Day. From a report: Roughly 135 flights to, from or within the U.S. had been been cancelled as of 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time, while just over 1,100 were delayed, according to tracking service FlightAware. Airlines had canceled only 1.2% of U.S. flights so far this year as of Dec. 22, the lowest in five years. Nearly 3 million passengers were expected to pass through domestic airports during the busy holiday period, up 16% from 2022. Not everyone got off so lucky. 

Some passengers at Chicago&#x27;s Midway International Airport this Christmas Eve were left stranded on Christmas Eve, according to CBS News Chicago, with the U.S. carrier most disrupted during last year&#x27;s holiday period -- Southwest Airlines -- again experiencing problems. Southwest attributed the delays to foggy weather in Chicago, but passengers also told CBS2 that a shortage of workers was a factor. Those snafus also affected passengers at Denver International Airport, with Southwest canceling 293 flights on Sunday, while nearly 1,300 trips were delayed, FlightAware data shows.

                              <span>U.S. officials are worried about hacking and insider theft of AI secrets, which China has denied. From a report: On a July day in 2018, Xiaolang Zhang headed to the San Jose, Calif., airport to board a flight to Beijing. He had passed the checkpoint at Terminal B when his journey was abruptly cut short by federal agents. After a tipoff by Apple&#x27;s security team, the former Apple employee was arrested and charged with stealing trade secrets related to the company&#x27;s autonomous-driving program. It was a skirmish in a continuing shadow war between the U.S. and China for supremacy in artificial intelligence. The two rivals are seeking any advantage to jump ahead in mastering a technology with the potential to reshape economies, geopolitics and war. 

Artificial intelligence has been on the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s list of critical U.S. technologies to protect, just as China placed it on a list of technologies it wanted its scientists to achieve breakthroughs on by 2025. China&#x27;s AI capabilities are already believed to be formidable, but U.S. intelligence authorities have lately made new warnings beyond the threat of intellectual-property theft. Instead of just stealing trade secrets, the FBI and other agencies believe China could use AI to gather and stockpile data on Americans at a scale that was never before possible. China has been linked to a number of significant thefts of personal data over the years, and artificial intelligence could be used as an &quot;amplifier&quot; to support further hacking operations, FBI Director Christopher Wray said, speaking at a press conference in Silicon Valley earlier this year.

The company began notifying customers on December 22nd via emails titled &quot;Important information regarding your account,&quot; stating that they suffered a security incident and a hacker obtained customer information.

                              <span>Alphabet&#x27;s Google considered changing its app store pricing model to circumvent a regulatory crackdown, but abandoned a proposal to charge a set fee per app after it became clear that could cost the company billions of dollars, according to documents released late week. From a report: Google created Project Everest in 2021 to reconsider the Play Store billing model, according to the documents, which were released as part of an antitrust suit by Epic Games. Google last week lost the suit brought by the maker of Fortnite when a federal jury found the tech giant abused its monopoly power over the app store. Sparked by mounting pressure from regulators and developers over Google Play&#x27;s hefty 30% commission, the presentation showed the search giant was concerned about staving off what it saw as potential regulatory overreach. 

&quot;We can defend the status quo for a few months,&quot; Google said in the presentation. &quot;Making proposed changes sooner may help support reasonable legislation, position Google as a leader, and prevent more draconian legislation.&quot; Project Everest explored charging developers piecemeal service fees for putting their apps or games in the Play Store, with additional fees for user downloads, updates and referrals. But the company estimated that model created &quot;potential for significant loss&quot; from $1 billion to $2 billion for apps and $6 billion to $9 billion for games.

                              <span>The Biden administration has spent much of the last two years bracing key U.S. networks and infrastructure against crippling cyberattacks from Russia, Iran and China. But it is following a different playbook as it ramps up its efforts to thwart digital threats from North Korea: Follow the crypto -- and stop it. From a report: Convinced North Korea primarily sees hacking as a way to funnel money back to the cash-strapped Kim Jong Un regime, the White House has focused on blocking the country&#x27;s ability to launder the cryptocurrency it steals through its cyberattacks. In the last year, the administration has unveiled a flurry of sanctions against North Korean hacking groups, front companies and IT workers, and blacklisted multiple cryptocurrency services they use to launder stolen funds. Earlier this month, national security adviser Jake Sullivan announced a new partnership with Japan and South Korea aimed at cracking down on Pyongyang&#x27;s crypto bonanza -- thereby choking off money to its nuclear and conventional weapons programs. 

&quot;In countering North Korean cyber operations, our first priority has been focusing on their crypto heists,&quot; Anne Neuberger, the National Security Council&#x27;s top cybersecurity official, said in an interview. The stepped-up effort to blunt North Korea&#x27;s cyber operations is fueled by growing alarm about where the fruits of those attacks are going, Neuberger said. Hacking, she argued, has enabled North Korea to &quot;either evade sanctions or evade the steps the international community has taken to target their weapons proliferation ... their missile regime, and the growth in the number of launches we&#x27;ve seen.&quot;

                              <span>Abstract of a paper published on the American Psychological Association: People are frequently invited to join others for fun social activities. They may be invited to lunch, to attend a sporting event, to watch the season finale of a television show, and so forth. Invitees -- those who are on the receiving ends of invitations -- sometimes accept invitations from inviters -- those who extend invitations -- but other times, invitees decline. Unfortunately, saying no can be hard, leading invitees to accept invitations when they would rather not. The present work sheds light on one factor that makes it so hard to decline invitations. 

We demonstrate that invitees overestimate the negative ramifications that arise in the eyes of inviters following an invitation decline. Invitees have exaggerated concerns about how much the decline will anger the inviter, signal that the invitee does not care about the inviter, make the inviter unlikely to offer another invitation in the future, and so forth. We also demonstrate that this asymmetry emerges in part because invitees exaggerate the degree to which inviters focus on the decline itself, as opposed to the thoughts ran through the invitee&#x27;s head before deciding. Indeed, across multiple studies, we find support for this process through mediation and moderation, while simultaneously finding evidence against multiple alternative accounts. We conclude with a discussion of the contributions and limitations of this research, along with directions for future work.

                              <span>&quot;What would you like OpenAI to build/fix in 2024?&quot; the company&#x27;s CEO asked on X this weekend. 

But &quot;Amid all the hysteria about ChatGPT and co, one thing is being missed,&quot; argues the Observer — &quot;how energy-intensive the technology is.&quot;

The current moral panic also means that a really important question is missing from public discourse: what would a world suffused with this technology do to the planet? Which is worrying because its environmental impact will, at best, be significant and, at worst, could be really problematic. 

How come? Basically, because AI requires staggering amounts of computing power. And since computers require electricity, and the necessary GPUs (graphics processing units) run very hot (and therefore need cooling), the technology consumes electricity at a colossal rate. Which, in turn, means CO2 emissions on a large scale — about which the industry is extraordinarily coy, while simultaneously boasting about using offsets and other wheezes to mime carbon neutrality. 

The implication is stark: the realisation of the industry&#x27;s dream of &quot;AI everywhere&quot; (as Google&#x27;s boss once put it) would bring about a world dependent on a technology that is not only flaky but also has a formidable — and growing — environmental footprint. Shouldn&#x27;t we be paying more attention to this?

                              <span>&quot;The Portland International Airport in Oregon understands holiday travel is stressful. So this season, it invited a few specialists...&quot; writes the Washington Post. 

One TV station describes them as &quot;therapy llamas... two 400-pound fluffballs serving as therapy animals&quot; stationed at Portland International Airport (or PDX) earlier this week, for &quot;travelers, in need of a calming moment.&quot; 

From the Washington Post:

Airports around the globe use a variety of methods to inject some Zen into one of the busiest travel periods of the year. They decorate their halls in holiday lights, host carolers and concerts, and bring in therapy dogs for group canine counseling. 
 Portland does all of the above. True to the city&#x27;s quirky spirit, it also invites local camelids to the airport to canoodle with passengers. That&#x27;s where Gregory, president and founder of Mountain Peaks Therapy Llamas &amp; Alpacas, comes in. &quot;PDX has an ongoing partnership with various therapy animal programs,&quot; said Allison Ferre, media relations manager with the Port of Portland, which operates the airport. &quot;So this year, when we were bringing back holiday concessions programing, we just thought, &quot;Who better to lead that parade than the llamas and alpacas?&quot; 
 This year&#x27;s theme was &quot;reindeer.&quot; Gregory and her daughter, Shannon Joy, dressed the pair in antler headbands, glittery halters with tinkling bells and poinsettia-adorned wreathes. Red velvet banners worn like saddles were inscribed with their names and silvery snowflakes. &quot;They looked pretty fancy,&quot; Gregory said... 

Though the pair had to pass through security, they didn&#x27;t have to submit to a pat down, which they might have enjoyed for the extra pets.

&quot;But before you give one, think twice about what you&#x27;re opting that person into.&quot;

A number of these gifts raise red flags for us as privacy-conscious digital advocates. Ring cameras are one of the most obvious examples, but countless others over the years have made the security or privacy naughty list (and many of these same electronics directly clash with your right to repair). One big problem with giving these sorts of gifts is that you&#x27;re opting another person into a company&#x27;s intrusive surveillance practice, likely without their full knowledge of what they&#x27;re really signing up for...

                              <span>The New York Times reports:

Last month, I received an alarming email from someone I did not know: Rui Zhu, a Ph.D. candidate at Indiana University Bloomington. Mr. Zhu had my email address, he explained, because GPT-3.5 Turbo, one of the latest and most robust large language models (L.L.M.) from OpenAI, had delivered it to him. My contact information was included in a list of business and personal email addresses for more than 30 New York Times employees that a research team, including Mr. Zhu, had managed to extract from GPT-3.5 Turbo in the fall of this year. With some work, the team had been able to &quot;bypass the model&#x27;s restrictions on responding to privacy-related queries,&quot; Mr. Zhu wrote. 

My email address is not a secret. But the success of the researchers&#x27; experiment should ring ala…</span>

A company offers you a tool to make your life easier, but, when you use it, you find out that the tool forces you to use it only in the way the tool&#x27;s manufacturer approves. Does this story ring a bell? It&#x27;s what millions of software users worldwide experience again and again, day after day. It&#x27;s also the story of Wendell the Elf and the ShoeTool. 
They suggest enjoying the video &quot;to remind yourself why you shouldn&#x27;t let your tools tell you how to use them.&quot; First released in 2019, it&#x27;s available on the free/open-source video site PeerTube, a decentralized (and ActivityPub-federated) platform powered by WebTorrent. 

They&#x27;ve also created a shortened URL for sharing on social media (recommending the hashtag #shoetool ). &quot;And, of course, you can adapt the video to your liking after downloading the source files.&quot;

Or, you can share the holiday fairy tale with your loved ones so that they can learn not to let their tools control them.

                              <span>For Epic&#x27;s Christmas special this year, they&#x27;re giving away for free &quot;an AAA game that only launched back in 2022...&quot; reports ComicBook.com — a game that invites players to &quot;ally with a powerful spectral entity on theirâquest for vengeance.&quot; 

ComicBook.com notes that the game giveaway is &quot;not for long... Starting today and lasting until the late morning of December 25.&quot;

The latest free game on the Epic Games Store is almost certainly the biggest title that users have received so far to coincide with the holidays... Initially released back in March 2022, Ghostwire: Tokyo is developed by Tango Gameworks and published by Bethesda. Since this is a AAA title, Ghostwire: Tokyo normally retails for $59.99 in total. As such, for it to now be free means that this is one of the best deals that Epic has had so far to close out the year... 

Epic&#x27;s ongoing holiday promotion is set to extend to January and should see 17 games in total being handed out at no cost. This promotion will continue tomorrow on Christmas Day when a new freebie lands on the PC platform.

                              <span>An anonymous Slashdot reader shared this report from CNET:
Marking its 60th year on television, the British time-travel series will close out 2023 with one last anniversary special that arrives on Christmas Day. Ncuti Gatwa&#x27;s Doctor helms the Tardis in The Church on Ruby Road, which centers on an abandoned baby who grows up looking for answers... Disney Plus will stream Doctor Who: The Church on Ruby Road on Monday, Dec. 25, at 12:55 p.m. ET (9:55 a.m. PT) in all regions except the UK and Ireland, where it will air on the BBC. In case you missed it, viewers can also watch David Tennant starring in the other three anniversary specials: The Star Beast, Wild Blue Yonder and The Giggle. All releases are available on Disney Plus. 

But what&#x27;s interesting is CNET goes on to explain &quot;why a VPN could be a useful tool.&quot;

Perhaps you&#x27;re traveling abroad and want to stream Disney Plus while away from home. With a VPN, you&#x27;re able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the series from anywhere in the world. There are other good reasons to use a VPN for streaming too. A VPN is the best way to encrypt your traffic and stop your ISP from throttling your speeds... 

You can use a VPN to stream content legally as long as VPNs are allowed in your country and you have a valid subscription to the streaming service you&#x27;re using. The U.S. and Canada are among the countries where VPNs are legal

This proposal will only be implemented if approved by the Fedora Engineering Steering Committee.&quot; 


But Phoronix reports that &quot;One of the latest change proposals filed for Fedora 40 is to unify their /usr/bin and /usr/sbin locations.&quot;
The change proposal explains: 

 &quot;The /usr/sbin directory becomes a symlink to bin, which means paths like /usr/bin/foo and /usr/sbin/foo point to the same place. /bin and /sbin are already symlinks to /usr/bin and /usr/sbin, so effectively /bin/foo and /sbin/foo also point to the same place. /usr/sbin will be removed from the default $PATH.&quot;

                              <span>&quot;Of course AI is a bubble,&quot; argues tech activist/blogger/science fiction author Cory Doctorow. 
The real question is what happens when it bursts? 

Doctorow examines history — the &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; of the dotcom bubble, 2008&#x27;s financial derivatives, NFTs, and even cryptocurrency. (&quot;A few programmers were trained in Rust... but otherwise, the residue from crypto is a lot of bad digital art and worse Austrian economics.&quot;) So would an AI bubble leave anything useful behind?


The largest of these models are incredibly expensive. They&#x27;re expensive to make, with billions spent acquiring training data, labelling it, and running it through massive computing arrays to turn it into models. Even more important, these models are expensive to run.... Do the potential paying customers for these l…</span>

&quot;The sequel cost $205 million,&quot; notes Variety, &quot;and ranks among the worst debuts of the year for a superhero movie.&quot;

It&#x27;s softer than November&#x27;s misfire The Marvels ($47 million), which ended its run as the lowest-grossing installment in the history of Disney&#x27;s Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Marvels was shocking because it was the rare MCU movie to tumble out of the gate. 
By contrast, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is shaping up to be the fourth of four DC movies this year to crumble at the box office. Already in 2023, The Flash ($55 mi…</span>

                              <span>A Canadian cybersecurity firm has warned that as soon as 2025, quantum computers could make current encryption methods useless. 

But now Slashdot reader christoban shares a &quot;reality check&quot; — an IEEE Spectrum takedown with the tagline &quot;Hype is everywhere, skeptics say, and practical applications are still far away.&quot;

The quantum computer revolution may be further off and more limited than many have been led to believe. That&#x27;s the message coming from a small but vocal set of prominent skeptics in and around the emerging quantum computing industry... [T]here&#x27;s growing pushback against what many see as unrealistic expectations for the technology.

                              <span>&quot;It&#x27;s like visiting an old friend for the holidays,&quot; according to this article:

Approaching his 86th birthday, Donald Knuth — Stanford&#x27;s beloved computer science guru — honored what&#x27;s become a long-standing tradition. He gave a December &quot;Christmas lecture&quot; that&#x27;s also streamed online for all of his fans... 

More than 60 years ago, back in 1962, a 24-year-old Donald Knuth first started writing The Art of Computer Programming — a comprehensive analysis of algorithms which, here in 2023, he&#x27;s still trying to finish. And 30 years ago Knuth also began making rare live appearances each December in front of audiences of Stanford students... 
Recently Stanford uploaded several decades of Knuth&#x27;s past Christmas lectures, along with a series of 22 videos of Knuth from 1985 titled &quot;the &#x27;Aha&#x27; Sessions&#x27;&quot; (courses in mathematical problem-solving). There are also two different sets of five videos from 1981 showing Knuth introducing his newly-created typesetting system TeX. There are even 12 videos from 1982 of what Knuth calls &quot;an intensive course about the internal details.&quot; 

And on Dec. 6, wearing his traditional brown holiday sweater, Knuth gave yet another live demonstration of the beautifully clear precision that&#x27;s made him famous.

The year 2023 is on track to see the biggest increase in renewable energy capacity to date, according to the International Energy Agency. China, the world&#x27;s biggest climate polluter, has made lightning advances in renewables, with the country set to shatter its wind and solar target five years early. A report published in June found that China&#x27;s solar capacity is now greater than the rest of the world&#x27;s nations combined, in a surge described by the report&#x27;s author, Global Energy Monitor, as &quot;jaw-dropping....&quot;

Some of the highlights?


&#x27;Clubhouse&#x27; Clones 
In the early days of the pandemic, when Zoom happy hours and sourdough starters proliferated, Clubhouse burst onto the scene with an app that facilitated audio-only chats between groups large and small. Tech giants quickly churned out their own Clubhouse clones, but these party-line throwbacks were not long for this world. Facebook was the first to go, ditching its Live Audio Rooms in December 2022, but 2023 also saw the end of Reddit Talk, Spotify Live, and Amazon&#x27;s live radio DJ Amp app. [X Spaces is still around]

Providers of critical infrastructure in the United States are doing a sloppy job of defending against cyber intrusions, the National Security Council tells Fast Company, pointing to recent Iran-linked attacks on U.S. water utilities that exploited basic security lapses [earlier this month]. The security council tells Fast Company it&#x27;s also aware of recent intrusions by hackers linked to China&#x27;s military at American infrastructure entities that include water and energy utilities in multiple states. 

Neither the Iran-linked or China-linked attacks affected critical systems or caused disruptions, according to reports.

                              <span>&quot;The iMessage connection software that powers Beeper Mini and Beeper Cloud is now 100% open source,&quot; Beeper announced late this week. &quot; Anyone who wants can use it or continue development.&quot; 

But while Beeper says it&#x27;s done trying to bring iMessage to Android, CNET reports that the whole battle was &quot;deeply tied&quot; to Apple&#x27;s ongoing strategy to control the mobile market:

The tide seems to be changing, however: Apple said last month it would be opening up its Messages app (likely due to European regulation) to work with the newer, more feature-rich texting protocol called RCS. This hopefully will lead to a more modern and secure messaging experience when texting between an iPhone and an Android phone, and lead away from the aging SMS and MMS standards. Unfortunately, green bubbles will continue to persist even if there might be little to no functional difference. While third-party apps like Nothing Chats attempted and ultimately failed to bring iMessage to Android, Apple will likely never release the app on Google&#x27;s mobile operating system. 

Until RCS is fully adopted, companies are creating services to allow access to iMessage via Android phones. Apple, for its part, has been quick to block apps like Beeper Mini, citing security concerns. This, however, is raising eyebrows from lawmakers regarding competition in the messaging space and Apple&#x27;s tight control over the market... 

Beeper in a December 21 blog post told users to grab a jailbroken iPhone and install a free Beeper tool that&#x27;ll generate iMessage registration codes to keep the service operational. It&#x27;s such a roundabout and potentially expensive way of trying to get iMessage on Android that it likely won&#x27;t be worth it for most people. For those not willing to go out and jailbreak an iPhone, Beeper said in a now-deleted blog post that it would allow people to rent a jailbroken unit for a small monthly fee starting next year.

He observed the outer  extreme of what happens to people who no longer have a WHY to live for. They’d wither and die in the camp. Even the most dire rations and punishing labor could be survived by many, as long as they had a purpose still beckoning, but once that light went out, so did they.
Modern life is rarely that dramatic for most people likely to read this, but Frankl’s fundamental truth is still relevant. A truth he spent the rest of his life trying to teach in the form of logotherapy as a psychotherapist.

                              <span>One of the driving aspirations behind once.com is the notion that not all software needs to evolve forever. We’ve become so used to digital services being malleable that we’ve confused the possibility of software updates with their necessity. Some software can simply be finished, and a lot would be better if it were.
That’s basically the antithesis of SaaS. Which relies on the pitch that the system is always improving to get people to pay every month. There’s a really powerful incentive in promising that what you buy today will become better tomorrow. More capable, more secure, more, more, more.
And that’s not wrong. We’ve built our business at 37signals on that prospect. Basecamp has literally evolved for over twenty years now, and HEY has been going strong for more then three. I do reall…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this report from Reuters:

In February, a Canadian cybersecurity firm delivered an ominous forecast to the U.S. Department of Defense. America&#x27;s secrets — actually, everybody&#x27;s secrets — are now at risk of exposure, warned the team from Quantum Defen5e (QD5). QD5&#x27;s executive vice president, Tilo Kunz, told officials from the Defense Information Systems Agency that possibly as soon as 2025, the world would arrive at what has been dubbed &quot;Q-day,&quot; the day when quantum computers make current encryption methods useless. Machines vastly more powerful than today&#x27;s fastest supercomputers would be capable of cracking the codes that protect virtually all modern communication, he told the agency, which is tasked with safeguarding the U.S. military&#x27;s communications.

                              <span>&quot;Millions of Star Wars fans get nostalgia pangs during the holiday season,&quot; reports the Washington Post, &quot;when they are accustomed to seeing broadcasts of their beloved movies.... FX, now owned by Disney, has multiple Star Wars marathons on tap this month, including a marathon on December 23 and 24.&quot; The program-planning director at Disney&#x27;s Freedom channel even calls Star Wars a &quot;Christmas-adjacent&quot; franchise. 

And now, long-time Slashdot reader H_Fisher writes...

Call it a Life Day miracle, even if nobody was asking for it. YouTube historian and retro-tech enthusiast Perifractic uploaded a restored, mostly-complete 4K upscale of the &quot;infamous&quot; Star Wars Holiday Special to his channel on Wednesday. From the video summary: &quot;Using Topaz Labs [Video AI] with a few other techniques we&#x27;ve meticulously upscaled &amp; restored the infamous Star Wars Holiday Special to 5120x3840, with stereo elements, to the best quality the technology currently allows.&quot; Jokingly labeling the resulting file &quot;5K&quot; (8K video height, but tagged &quot;4K&quot; by YouTube due to its original 4:3 aspect ratio), the upscaled version unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your point of view) replaces some songs and omits some segments that were flagged by YouTube&#x27;s copyright watchdog.

                              <span>&quot;The age of the dinosaurs ended 66 million years ago when a city-size asteroid struck a shallow sea off the coast of what is now Mexico,&quot; writes CNN. 

&quot;But exactly how the mass extinction of 75% of the species on Earth unfolded in the years that followed the cataclysmic impact has remained unclear.&quot;

Previous research suggested that sulfur released during the impact, which left the 112-mile-wide (180-kilometer-wide) Chicxulub crater, and soot from wildfires triggered a global winter, and temperatures plunged. However, a new study published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience suggests that fine dust made from pulverized rock thrown up into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere in the wake of the impact likely played a greater role. This dust blocked the sun to an extent that plants were unable to photosynthesize, a biological process critical for life, for almost two years afterward.


 &quot;Photosynthesis shutting down for almost two years after impact caused severe challenges (for life),&quot; said lead study author and planetary scientist Cem Berk Senel, a postdoctoral researcher at the Royal Observatory of Belgium. &quot;It collapsed the food web, creating a chain reaction of extinctions.&quot; 

To reach their findings, scientists developed a new computer model to simulate the global climate after the asteroid strike. The model was based on published information on Earth&#x27;s climate at that point in time, as well as new data from sediment samples taken from the Tanis fossil site in North Dakota that captured a 20-year period during the aftermath of the strike.

Last week a report was finally issued by the world governing body of chess, CNN reports:
FIDE&#x27;s report said that analysis from professor Kenneth Regan — a computer chess cheating expert — showed &quot;instances of cheating&quot; by Niemann in around 32-55 games on the online chess platform; far less than the 100 suggested by Chess.com. According to the FIDE report, Regan also found &quot;discrepancies&quot; in Niemann&#x27;s statement that he had only cheated between the ages of 12 and 16. However, the games of 2017 and the games against Bok in August of 2020 occurred after he turned 17 in June. Another important discrepancy is that the cheating took place in rated o…</span>

                              <span>&quot;I&#x27;m optimistic about the world&#x27;s climate progress,&quot; Bill Gates wrote this week — but he also explained why. 
&quot;In 2024 and beyond, I predict we will see lots of new innovations coming into the marketplace — even in very complicated areas like nuclear. The climate crisis can feel overwhelming, but I find it easier to stay optimistic when you focus on all the progress we&#x27;re making. If the world continues to prioritize funding innovation, I&#x27;m hopeful we can make good progress on our climate goals.&quot; 

And elsewhere Gates writes that &quot;AI is about to supercharge the innovation pipeline.&quot;

My work has always been rooted in a core idea: Innovation is the key to progress. It&#x27;s why I started Microsoft, and it&#x27;s why Melinda and I started the Gates Foundation more than two decades ago. Innovation is t…</span>

                              <span>Slashdot reader sciencehabit writes: If you&#x27;ve ever seen a cow staring vacantly across a field, or a pig rolling around in its own filth, you might not think there&#x27;s a lot going on in their head. You wouldn&#x27;t be alone. People haven&#x27;t given much credence to the intelligence of farm animals, and neither have scientists. But that&#x27;s starting to change.

 A growing field of research is showing that—when it comes to the minds of goats, cows, and other livestock—we may have been missing something big. Studies published over the past few years have shown that pigs show signs of empathy, goats rival dogs in some tests of social intelligence, and cows can be potty trained.

 Much of this work is being carried out at the Research Institute for Farm Animal Biology (FBN) in Dummerstorf, Germany, one of the world&#x27;s leading centers for investigating the minds of creatures that often end up on our dinner plate. From cows making friends to goats exhibiting signs of altruism, farm animals are upending popular—and scientific—conceptions of what&#x27;s going on in their minds.

 The work may not just rewrite our thinking about livestock, it might also change how we treat them. As Jan Langbein, an applied ethologist at FBN told says, &#x27;If we don&#x27;t understand how these animals think, then we won&#x27;t understand what they need. And if we don&#x27;t understand what they need, we can&#x27;t design better environments for them.&#x27;

                              <span>The New Yorker looks at 41-year-old Amabel Holland, an autistic board-game designer who &quot;thinks about the world in terms of systems,&quot; and realized you could make a board game about almost anything, &quot;and, when you did, its rules could both mirror and analyze the subject on which it was based.&quot; 

They&#x27;ve since designed more than 60 games, and the article notes that Holland&#x27;s work, &quot;which is part of a larger turn toward complexity in the industry, often tackles historical and social subjects — death, religion, misinformation — using surprising &#x27;mechanics,&#x27; or building blocks of game play, to immerse players in an experience.&quot;
&quot;With every game, you build a certain model of the world,&quot; Reiner Knizia, a former mathematician who&#x27;s designed more than eight hundred games, told me. Several of his games illustrate market forces: in Modern Art, for instance, you play as auctioneers and buyers, hoping to buy low and sell high. Knizia is a traditional game designer inasmuch as he aims to &quot;bring enjoyment to the people.&quot; But Amabel sometimes aims for the opposite of enjoyment... This Guilty Land, from 2018, is about the struggle to end slavery.&quot; 

Holland says their games are &quot;meant to evoke frustration&quot; — specifically to communicate how difficult it can be to actually achieve political progress.

For the past few years, parents, researchers, and the news media have paid closer attention to the relationship between teenagers&#x27; phone use and their mental health. Researchers such as Jonathan Haidt and Jean Twenge have shown that various measures of student well-being began a sharp decline around 2012 throughout the West, just as smartphones and social media emerged as the attentional centerpiece of teenage life. Some have even suggested that smartphone use is so corrosive, it&#x27;s systematically reducing student achievement. I hadn&#x27;t quite believed that last argument — until now.

                              <span>Scientists have developed a vibrating pill that, when swallowed before eating, can create a feeling of fullness. The Guardian reports: The research, which has yet to be carried out in humans, shows that after 30 minutes of activity by the Vibes pill, pigs ate on average almost 40% less food in the following half hour than they did without the device, and gained weight more slowly. The Vibes name is an acronym derived from the pill&#x27;s full title -- Vibrating Ingestible BioElectronic Stimulator. The work in pigs suggests the vibrations activate stretch receptors in the stomach, simulating the presence of food. This results in signals being sent to the hypothalamus in the brain via the vagus nerve, increasing levels of various hormones that give rise to a feeling of fullness and decreasing those that result in feelings of hunger.
 
&quot;We envision the Vibes pill being ingested on a relatively empty stomach 20 to 30 min before anticipated meals to trigger the desired sensation of satiety early in the meal,â the team write, adding that when produced at scale, the cost of the pills is expected to be in the cents to one dollar range. The vibrations, which are powered by a battery encased in the swallowed capsule, can be triggered when stomach acid dissolves a membrane around the pill, or by a timer. The researchers say the pills, which are about the size of a large vitamin tablet, offer a non-invasive, temporary therapy, without the need for weight-loss surgery, and exit the body with other solid waste -- meaning in humans they are flushed down the toilet. However they suggest it could be possible to develop pills that are implanted, or stay in the stomach, to reduce the need for people to repeatedly take them, should they require continuing therapy.

This advanced device, capable of both processing and storing information simultaneously, marks a notable shift from traditional machine-learning tasks to performing associative learning -- similar to higher-level human cognition. This study introduces a device that operates effectively at room temperatures, a notable improvement over previous brain-like computing devices that required extremely cold conditions to keep their circuits from overheating.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Guardian: From empty glasses of sherry on the mantelpiece to sooty footprints leading to the bedroom door, evidence of Santa&#x27;s existence is clearly irrefutable. Yet most children will begin to question it at some point -- and many parents anticipate this moment with dread. Now psychologists have identified the average age when Santa skepticism creeps in, and which children are at greatest risk of harboring negative feelings when it does.
 
While most adults have fallen for the myth that Santa doesn&#x27;t exist, many children still believe -- even if the idea of a single individual visiting the homes of billions of children in a single night is at odds with their wider reasoning skills. Dr Candice Mills, a psychologist at the University of Texas in Dallas, US, and a Santa sceptic, said: &quot;Children typically begin to distinguish fantasy from reality during the preschool years, but their belief in the existence of a singular magical Santa Claus often continues into middle childhood.&quot; [...] To better understand this shift from belief to disbelief and children&#x27;s experiences of it, Mills and her colleagues interviewed 48 six- to 15-year-olds who had stopped believing in Santa and 44 of their parents, plus a further 383 adults.
 
The research, which has not yet been peer reviewed, found that for most children, disbelief crept in gradually about the age of eight -- although some three- or four-year-olds had convinced themselves that Santa wasn&#x27;t real, while other children believed in him until they were 15 or 16. In many cases, it was testimony from other disbelievers that finally crushed their faith. Mills said: &quot;They may have had some skepticism based on logical reasoning -- like how can Santa Claus really get around the world in one night? -- but what pushes them over the edge is a classmate at school saying he&#x27;s not real.&quot;

Reuters reports: The terms, valuation and timing of the funding round have not yet been finalized and could still change, the report added. OpenAI has also held discussions to raise funding for a new chip venture with Abu Dhabi-based G42, according to the report. If the valuation holds, the report notes that it would make OpenAI the second-most valuable U.S. startup behind Elon Musk&#x27;s SpaceX.

Not long thereafter, the tech-backed nonprofit Code.org (which promotes and provides K-12 CS education and is led by Smith&#x27;s next-door neighbor) and Mark Zuckerberg&#x27;s FWD.us PAC (which lobbied for H-1B reform) were born, with Smith on board both. Over the past 10+ years, Smith has played a key role in establishing Code.org&#x27;s influence in the new K-12 CS education &quot;grassroots&quot; movement, including getting buy-in from three Presidential administrations -- Obama, Trump, and Biden -- as well as the U.S. Dept. of Education and the natio…</span>

After presenting the new Turbo 8 stuff in Rails World, some people opined that Rails needed to improve collaboration in the frontend space. I got a variant of this question in a couple of podcasts, which also happened when we released Active Record Encryption. The underlying idea is that you should collaborate with other authors in the same space when building new things. Someone is using morphing. Someone else is doing database encryption. Why not reach out and join efforts?


To me, that&#x27;s a fallacious idea.

French startup Kosmik is building on that general concept with a knowledge-capturing tool that doesn&#x27;t require the user to switch between different windows or apps to capture information. Kosmik was founded in 2018 by Paul Rony and Christophe Van Deputte. Prior to that, Rony worked at a video production company as a junior director, and he wanted a single whiteboard-type canvas instead of file and folders where he could put videos, PDFs, websites, notes and drawings.

                              <span>According to Canalys Research, Microsoft&#x27;s plan to end support for Windows 10 could result in about 240 million computers being sent to landfills. &quot;The electronic waste from these PCs could weigh an estimated 480 million kilograms, equivalent to 320,000 cars,&quot; adds Reuters. From the report: While many PCs could remain functional for years post the end of OS support, Canalys warned demand for devices without security updates could be low. Microsoft announced a plan to provide security updates for Windows 10 devices until October 2028 for an undisclosed annual price. If the pricing structure for extended Windows 10 support mirrors past trends, migrating to newer PCs could be more cost-effective, increasing the number of older PCs heading to scrap, Canalys said.

                              <span>Phoronix&#x27;s Michael Larabel writes: With patches pending for creating an Acer Aspire 1 embedded controller driver, this Qualcomm Snapdragon powered ARM laptop has &quot;almost full support&quot; with the upstream Linux kernel. The Acer Aspire 1 (A114-61) is an aging ARM laptop design built on the Snapdragon 7c Gen1. It&#x27;s no longer the latest and greatest with it being a two year old device, but for those wanting a low-power and long-battery-life laptop, the Acer Aspire 1 still has some potential for Linux enthusiasts.
 
Over the course of this year this eight-core ARM laptop has been seeing work on mainline Linux kernel support. Since Linux 6.5 much of that support has been in place while some bits remain. Sent out recently was this patch series creating an embedded controller (EC) driver for the Acer Aspire 1. This EC driver gets battery and charger monitoring working along with USB Type-C DP Alt Mode HPD monitoring, lid status detection, and some keyboard configuration. The EC functionality on the Acer Aspire 1 is implemented in ACPI but sadly ACPI cant be used to boot Linux on these Qualcomm devices -- thus leading to this new &quot;acer-aspire1-ec&quot; driver being created.

The U.S. credit is the most generous in the world for hydrogen production, Jesse Jenkins, a professor at Princeton University who has analyzed the U.S. climate law, said last week. The proposal -- which is part of Democrats&#x27; Inflation Reduction Act passed last year -- outlines a tiered system to determine which hydrogen producers get the most credits, with cleaner energy projects receiving more, and smaller, but still meaningful credits going to those that use fossil fuel to produce hydroge…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: It may be the season of loving and giving, but doctors have warned against embracing this spirit too enthusiastically -- at least where sexual relations are concerned. They have discovered that the Christmas period is associated with a significantly increased risk of penile fractures -- a medical emergency in which the erection-producing regions of the penis snap, usually as a result of forceful bending during over-enthusiastic sexual intercourse. &quot;This injury tends to occur during wild sex -- particularly in positions where you&#x27;re not in direct eye contact [with your partner], such as the reverse cowgirl,&quot; said Dr Nikolaos Pyrgides, a urologist at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, who led the research. 

The fractures are often heralded by an audible crack, followed by severe pain, rapid loss of erection and severe swelling and bruising. &quot;When [patients] present to their doctor their penis often looks like an eggplant,&quot; Pyrgides said. Suspecting that the intimacy and euphoria of the festive season might be a risk factor for this type of injury, Pyrgides and his colleagues examined hospital data for 3,421 men who sustained penile fractures in Germany between 2005 and 2021. The study -- the first to explore seasonal patterns for this type of injury -- found that such injuries were indeed more common over Christmas. In fact, &quot;if every day was like Christmas, 43% more penile fractures would have occurred in Germany from 2005 on,&quot; Pyrgides said. The research, which was published in the British Journal of Urology International, also found the risk increased at weekends and over the summer holidays. However, New Year&#x27;s Eve was not associated with an increased incidence of penis injuries.

                              <span>Banks lend your deposits to carbon-heavy industries, fueling climate change; savings of $1,000 create emissions equal to a New York-Seattle flight, reveals a new analysis. Wired: By switching to a climate-conscious bank, you could reduce those emissions by about 75 percent, the study found. In fact, if you moved $8,000 dollars -- the median balance for US customers -- the reduction in your indirect emissions would be twice that of the direct emissions you&#x27;d avoid if you switched to a vegetarian diet. [...] The new report finds that on average, 11 of the largest US banks lend 19.4 percent of their portfolios to carbon-intensive industries. To be very clear: Oil, gas, and coal companies wouldn&#x27;t be able to keep producing these fuels -- when humanity needs to be reducing carbon emissions dramatically and rapidly -- without these loans. New fossil fuel projects aren&#x27;t simply fleeting endeavors, but will operate for years, locking in a certain amount of emissions going forward.

The pitch was so successful that AWS pulls in $90 billion per year. Then generative AI emerged, with Microsoft and Google baking it into products their cloud units sell. Suddenly, AWS faced startups building businesses on rivals&#x27; AI-powered platforms. So at AWS&#x27;s 2023 event, AI was ubiquitous -- in presentations, launches, partnerships. AWS announced more models powering AI services and its largest-ever tech investment, $4 billion in generative AI startup Anthropic.

From a report: The constant checks could mean that you&#x27;re alerted about a password that you should change sooner than you would have before. Safety Check also watches for bad extensions or site permissions you need to look at, and you can act on Safety Check alerts from Chrome&#x27;s three-dot menu. In addition, Google says that Safety Check can revoke a site&#x27;s permissions if you haven&#x27;t visited it in a while. Google also announced an upcoming feature for Chrome&#x27;s tab groups, also on desktop: Chrome will let you save tab groups so that you can use those groups across devices, which might be handy when moving between a PC at home and a laptop when traveling. Google says this feature will roll out &quot;over the next few weeks.&quot;

                              <span>Beeper Mini, which offers iPhone messaging on Android phones, has grown fast and its duel with Apple has gotten the attention of antitrust regulators. The New York Times: Apple was caught by surprise when Beeper Mini gave Android devices access to its modern, iPhone-only service. Less than a week after Beeper Mini&#x27;s launch, Apple blocked the app by changing its iMessage system. It said the app created a security and privacy risk. Apple&#x27;s reaction set off a game of Whac-a-Mole, with Beeper Mini finding alternative ways to operate and Apple finding new ways to block the app in response. The duel has raised questions in Washington about whether Apple has used its market dominance over iMessage to block competition and force consumers to spend more on iPhones than lower-priced alternatives. 

The Justice Department has taken interest in the case. Beeper Mini met with the department&#x27;s antitrust lawyers on Dec. 12, two people familiar with the meeting said. Eric Migicovsky, a co-founder of the app&#x27;s parent company, Beeper, declined to comment on the meeting, but the department is in the middle of a four-year-old investigation into Apple&#x27;s anticompetitive behavior. The Federal Trade Commission said in a blog post on Thursday that it would scrutinize &quot;dominant&quot; players that &quot;use privacy and security as a justification to disallow interoperability&quot; between services. The post did not name any companies.

                              <span>Beijing is moving to curb excessive spending on video games across the country, according to a new draft regulation, dealing another blow to the world&#x27;s largest video gaming market that is still recovering from the government&#x27;s previous industry crackdown. From a report: Online games must not offer rewards that entice people to excessively play and spend, including those for daily logins and topping up accounts with additional funds, according to draft rules published on Friday by industry regulator the National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA). All video games must put a cap on how much players can top up their accounts and alert users about &quot;irrational consumption behaviour&quot; via a pop-up window, according to the NPPA.

                              <span>India is testing AI to build climate models to improve weather forecasting as torrential rains, floods and droughts proliferate across the vast country, a top weather official said. From a report: Global warming has triggered more intense clashes of weather systems in India in recent years, increasing extreme weather events, which the independent Centre for Science and Environment estimates have killed nearly 3,000 people this year. Weather agencies around the world are focussing on AI, which can bring down cost and improve speed, and which Britain&#x27;s Met Office says could &quot;revolutionise&quot; weather forecasting, with a recent Google-funded model found to have outperformed conventional methods. 

Accurate weather forecasting is particularly crucial in India, a country of 1.4 billion people, many impoverished, and the world&#x27;s second-largest producer of rice, wheat and sugar. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) provides forecasts based on mathematical models using supercomputers. Using AI with an expanded observation network could help generate higher-quality forecast data at lower cost. The department expects the AI-based climate models and advisories it is developing to help improve forecasts, K.S. Hosalikar, head of climate research and services at IMD, told Reuters.

The report cites people briefed on the plans and says Google intends to &quot;consolidate staff, including through possible layoffs, by reassigning employees at its large customer sales unit who oversee relationships with major advertisers.&quot; According to the report, the jobs are being vacated because Google&#x27;s new AI tools have automated them. The report says a future restructuring was apparently already announced at a department-wide Google Ads meeting last week.

                              <span>Velcroman1 writes: Intel&#x27;s new generation of &quot;Meteor Lake&quot; mobile CPUs herald a new age of &quot;AI PCs,&quot; computers that can handle inference workloads such as generating images or transcribing audio without an Internet connection. Officially named &quot;Intel Core Ultra&quot; processors, the chips are the first to feature an NPU (neural processing unit) that&#x27;s purpose-built to handle AI tasks. But there are few ways to actually test this feature at present: software will need to be rewritten to specifically direct operations at the NPU. 
Intel has steered testers toward its Open Visual Inference and Neural Network Optimization (OpenVINO) AI toolkit. With those benchmarks, Tom&#x27;s Hardware tested the new Intel chips against AMD -- and surprisingly, AMD chips often came out on top, even on these hand-selected benchmarks. Clearly, optimization will take some time!

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Register: It will take 283 years for female representation in IT to make up an equal share of the tech workforce in the UK, according to a report from the British Computer Society, the chartered institute for IT (BCS). BCS has calculated that based on trends from 2005 to 2022, it would take nearly three centuries for the representation of women in the IT workforce -- currently 20 percent -- to reach the average representation across the whole UK workforce, currently at 48 percent. BCS&#x27;s annual Diversity Report also found that progress towards the gender norm was stalling in IT jobs. Between 2018 and 2021, the proportion of women tech workers rose from 16 percent to 20 percent. But there was no change in 2022, according to BCS analysis of data from the Office for National Statistics.
 
Julia Adamson, BCS managing director for education and public benefit, said in a statement: &quot;More women and girls need the opportunity to take up great careers in a tech industry that&#x27;s shaping the world. A massive pool of talent and creativity is being overlooked when it could benefit employers and the economy. There has to be a radical rethink of how we get more women and girls into tech careers, and a more inclusive tech culture is ethically and morally the right thing to do. Having greater diversity means that what is produced is more relevant to, and representative of, society at large. This is crucial when it comes to, for instance, the use of AI in medicine or finance. The fact that 94 percent of girls and 79 percent of boys drop computing at age 14 is a huge alarm bell we must not ignore; the subject should have a broader digital curriculum that is relevant to all young people.&quot;

                              <span>It’s that time of year where people often start thinking about new year’s resolutions. I want to loose 10 lbs, I want to read more books, I want to x, y, and z. Often, it’s just a fantasy. They’re not actually going to loose 10 lbs or they might order some more books but never read them. But at least there’s a spark of hope there. A fundamental faith that they could become a better them. I think that’s tremendously admirable.
The trouble with a lot of these aspirations, though, is that they require the formation of new habits and carving out new chunks of time in an already busy day. That’s not impossible, of course, but it’s hard.
But the one activity most people already have a huge block of the day carved out is at work. That’s a solid eight hours for the majority of people with a regula…</span>

                              <span>It has been nearly half a year since our last update. We are reimplementing the trait solver of rustc with the goal of completely replacing the existing systems. This should allow us to fix some long-standing bugs, enable future type system improvements, and reduce compile times. See the previous update for a more detailed introduction. We have continued to make big progress on the new solver, mostly focusing on getting the solver ready for use in coherence. We changed the unstable compiler flag to enable the new solver: you can now use -Znext-solver&#x3D;globally to enable it everywhere and -Znext-solver&#x3D;coherence to enable the new solver only for coherence checking.
The reimplementation of the trait solver is now ready for use in coherence checking, which is responsible for preventing overlap…</span>

                              <span>Emma Roth reports via The Verge: The 18-year-old Lapsus$ hacker who played a critical role in leaking Grand Theft Auto VI footage has been sentenced to life inside a hospital prison, according to a report from the BBC. A British judge ruled on Thursday that Arion Kurtaj is a high risk to the public because he still wants to commit cybercrimes.
 
In August, a London jury found that Kurtaj carried out cyberattacks against GTA VI developer Rockstar Games and other companies, including Uber and Nvidia. However, since Kurtaj has autism and was deemed unfit to stand trial, the jury was asked to determine whether he committed the acts in question, not whether he did so with criminal intent. During Thursday&#x27;s hearing, the court heard Kurtaj &quot;had been violent while in custody with dozens of reports of injury or property damage,&quot; the BBC reports. A mental health assessment also found that Kurtaj &quot;continued to express the intent to return to cybercrime as soon as possible.&quot; He&#x27;s required to stay in the hospital prison for life unless doctors determine that he&#x27;s no longer a danger.
 
Kurtaj leaked 90 videos of GTA VI gameplay footage last September while out on bail for hacking Nvidia and British telecom provider BT / EE. Although he stayed at a hotel under police protection during this time, Kurtaj still managed to carry out an attack on Rockstar Games by using the room&#x27;s included Amazon Fire Stick and a &quot;newly purchased smart phone, keyboard and mouse,&quot; according to a separate BBC report. Kurtaj was arrested for the final time following the incident. Another 17-year-old involved with Lapsus$ was handed an 18-month community sentence, called a Youth Rehabilitation Order, and a ban from using virtual private networks.

                              <span>Eight-year-old Bodhana Sivanandan from London has been crowned best female chess player at the European blitz championships, scoring 8.5/13 at the event and drawing with a grandmaster in a result described as &quot;unbelievable.&quot; The BBC reports: The chess prodigy, who began playing aged five, said she was &quot;proud&quot; of her performance over the weekend. The tournament was held at the blitz time control -- a quick form of chess where players have just minutes on their clocks for their moves. Bodhana&#x27;s opponents included grandmasters - the highest title given to the world&#x27;s strongest players -- international masters and experts.
 
&quot;I always try my best to win, sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t,&quot; Bodhana told BBC Radio 4&#x27;s Today program. &quot;I was very proud of myself when I got top girl in the European blitz.&quot; Asked if she gets nervous, she replied: &quot;No, I just play the board.&quot;
 
British International Master and commentator Lawrence Trent described Bodhana as &quot;one of the greatest talents I&#x27;ve witnessed in recent memory.&quot; &quot;The maturity of her play, her sublime touch, it&#x27;s truly breath taking,&quot; he wrote on X. &quot;I have no doubt she will be England&#x27;s greatest player and most likely one of the greatest the game has ever seen,&quot; Mr Trent added. Bodhana will next compete at the International Chess Congress in Hastings, one of the world&#x27;s longest running tournaments, on December 28.

It&#x27;s an interesting proposal for a number of reasons. The first is a general lack of U.S. state and national laws governing such growing concerns. It&#x27;s one of those things that has felt like science fiction to such a degree that many lawmakers had no interest in pursuing it in a pragmatic manner.

We are happy to announce that as of Monday, December 18th, arXiv is now generating an HTML formatted version of all papers submitted in TeX/LaTeX (as long as papers were submitted on or after December 1st, 2023 and HTML conversion is successful). 

HTML is not replacing PDF but will be an additional format available for arXiv users. Submitters will be invited to preview the HTML version of their papers during submission time, the same way they have always done with PDF. When accessing a paper&#x27;s abstract page, readers will see a link to view the HTML paper right under the PDF link. The request to offer arXiv-hosted papers in HTML format comes directly from scientists with disabilities who face barriers to accessing the research they need. HTML formatted papers are more easily and accurately read by screen readers and other technologies, which can assist researchers with reading disabilities, including blindness, low vision, dyslexia, and more.

                              <span>The police will be able to run facial recognition searches on a database containing images of Britain&#x27;s 50 million driving licence holders under a law change being quietly introduced by the government. From a report: Should the police wish to put a name to an image collected on CCTV, or shared on social media, the legislation would provide them with the powers to search driving licence records for a match. The move, contained in a single clause in a new criminal justice bill, could put every driver in the country in a permanent police lineup, according to privacy campaigners. 

Facial recognition searches match the biometric measurements of an identified photograph, such as that contained on driving licences, to those of an image picked up elsewhere. The intention to allow the police or the National Crime Agency (NCA) to exploit the UK&#x27;s driving licence records is not explicitly referenced in the bill or in its explanatory notes, raising criticism from leading academics that the government is &quot;sneaking it under the radar.&quot; Once the criminal justice bill is enacted, the home secretary, James Cleverly, must establish &quot;driver information regulations&quot; to enable the searches, but he will need only to consult police bodies, according to the bill.

                              <span>The politics of solving climate change may, paradoxically, require producing more fossil fuels for a while. Roge Karma, writing for The Atlantic: By boosting domestic oil supply, the Biden administration seems to be contributing to the very problem it claims to want to solve. The reality is more complicated. &quot;Pushing for reductions in U.S. oil production is like squeezing a balloon -- the production will &#x27;pop out&#x27; somewhere else,&quot; writes Samantha Gross, an energy-and-climate expert at the Brookings Institution. The world&#x27;s energy needs are growing rapidly, which means oil companies are going to supply it regardless of what the White House does. If the U.S. were to cut back tomorrow, prices would rise. In the short term, this would lead to less consumption and lower emissions. But those high prices would only entice producers in other countries to step in, as many did in the months after Russia&#x27;s invasion. 

For that reason, reductions in U.S. oil production could actually result in higher overall emissions. The U.S. has one of the least emissions-intensive oil industries on the planet. Shifting production to countries with looser standards would likely be worse for the climate. But the deeper explanation for the Biden administration&#x27;s actions has to do with the politics of climate change. Put simply, pursuing a decarbonization agenda requires Biden to maintain political support, and there is no surer way to lose political support than by presiding over high gas prices. Biden&#x27;s approval rating has tracked gas prices for most of his presidency (although he hasn&#x27;t yet benefited from recent improvements), and the drop in prices in the months leading up to the 2022 midterms may have contributed to Democrats&#x27; unexpectedly strong performance in those elections. Plus, when the price of energy goes up, the price of everything else tends to rise as well, sparking further inflation.

                              <span>Hyperloop One, the futuristic transportation company building tube-encased lines to zip passengers and freight from city to city at airplane-like speeds, is shutting down, Bloomberg News reported Thursday, citing people familiar with the situation. From the report: Once a high-profile startup, Hyperloop One raised more than $450 million since its founding in 2014, according to PitchBook. It built a small test track near Las Vegas to develop its transportation technology, and for a time took the name Virgin Hyperloop One after Richard Branson&#x27;s Virgin invested. Virgin removed its branding after the startup decided last year to focus on cargo rather than people. 

Now, the company has laid off most of its employees, and is trying to sell its remaining assets, including the test track and machinery, according to one of the people, who asked to remain anonymous discussing private information. In early 2022, the company employed more than 200 people. The business has also closed its Los Angeles office. The remaining workers, tasked with overseeing the asset sale, were told their employment will end on Dec. 31. DP World, the Dubai-based conglomerate, has backed Hyperloop One since 2016 and owns a majority stake. The startup&#x27;s remaining intellectual property will be transferred to DP World, a person familiar with the situation said.

From a report: Although the company has issued a complex workaround, it says it has no plans to roll out another one if this one is knocked down by Apple. &quot;Each time that Beeper Mini goes &#x27;down&#x27; or is made to be unreliable due to interference by Apple, Beeper&#x27;s credibility takes a hit,&quot; the company wrote in a blog post. &quot;It&#x27;s unsustainable. As much as we want to fight for what we believe is a fantastic product that really should exist, the truth is that we can&#x27;t win a cat-and-mouse game with the largest company on earth. With our latest software release, we believe we&#x27;ve created something that Apple can tolerate existing. We do not have any current plans to respond if this solution is knocked offline&quot;

Holz said V6 was actually the &quot;third model trained from scratch on our AI superclusters&quot; and took nine months to develop.

                              <span>Artificial rain has been used in an attempt to lower pollution levels in Lahore, Pakistan. From a report: The capital city of the eastern province of Punjab, near the Indian border, has some of the worst air quality in the world and has become extremely polluted because of a growing population of more than 13 million people. By early December, the air quality in the city had grown so bad that schools, markets and parks were closed for four days. By last weekend, the city&#x27;s air quality index (AQI) had reached levels considered extremely hazardous to health. 

To try to reduce them, on Saturday the Punjab government used cloud seeding to create rain in 10 locations around the city using a small Cessna plane. To create the clouds, there needs to be enough moisture already present in the clouds in the lower atmosphere. In summer, common table salt mixed with water is sprayed over the cloud patches from planes. After a few hours, the mist integrates with the clouds and produces rain. In winter, the clouds are seeded using flakes of silver iodide, which can be fired from a vehicle or a plane. The practice, also known as &quot;blueskying,&quot; has been used to induce precipitation in several countries in the Middle East, as well as China and India.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Eric Migicovsky insists his Beeper Mini will continue despite Apple&#x27;s best efforts to prevent it bringing iMessage blue speech bubbles to Android. Beeper Mini is, or is continually trying to be, a way to get iMessage without buying an iPhone -- although users might have to get access to a Mac. Since the start of December 2023, Beeper has launched a service to do this, then Apple blocked it, then Beeper tried another way. 

According to The Information, this cycle is going to continue, too, as Beeper CEO Eric Migicovsky maintains that his company will persist -- and could take legal action, too. &quot;We&#x27;re investigating legal ramifications for Apple, definitely,&quot; said Migicovsky. &quot;Around antitrust, around competition, around how they&#x27;ve made the experience worse for iPhone users with this change. They&#x27;ve degraded the performance of iMessage for iPhone users,&quot; he continued, &quot;all in search of crushing a competitor.&quot;

                              <span>New submitter ekimminau writes: On the morning of December 20, 2023, thousands of users turned on their Samsung TV to find that the Samsung TV Plus application was missing. Available for free on 2016-2023 Samsung Smart TVs, Galaxy devices, Smart Monitors, Family Hub refrigerators, and the web, for many it is their primary method of TV viewing. The masses began flocking to the Samsung community forums asking ... what was going on. 

From Cord Cutters: At this time, Samsung has not posted any updates about the outage. Customer service has been telling customers they are aware of the outage and are working on fixing it. This news comes as Samsung recently added seven local FOX news channels for community stories, sports updates, weather forecasts and more. The new markets are Austin, Detroit, Milwaukee, Orlando, Phoenix, Seattle and Tampa Bay. Right now, this outage seems to only be affecting the app on Smart TVs as the website is still working letting anyone stream Samsung TV Plus for free streaming online through the website.

                              <span>According to Axios, the CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, David Zaslav, met with Paramount Global CEO Bob Bakish to discuss a possible merger. &quot;The combination would create a news and entertainment behemoth that would likely trigger further industry consolidation,&quot; reports Axios. From the report: Zaslav also has spoken to Shari Redstone, who owns Paramount&#x27;s parent company, about a deal. WBD&#x27;s market value was around $29 billion as of Wednesday, while Paramount&#x27;s was just over $10 billion, so any merger would not be of equals. The meeting between Zaslav and Bakish, which sources say lasted several hours, took place at Paramount&#x27;s headquarters in Times Square.
 
The duo discussed ways their companies could complement one another. For example, each company&#x27;s main streaming service -- Paramount+ and Max -- could merge to better rival Netflix and Disney+. It&#x27;s unclear whether WBD would buy Paramount Global or its parent company, National Amusements Inc. (NAI), but a source familiar with the situation says that both options are on the table. WBD is said to have hired bankers to explore the deal.
 
The deal could drive substantial synergies. WBD could use its international distribution footprint to boost Paramount&#x27;s franchises, while Paramount&#x27;s children&#x27;s programing assets could be essential to WBD&#x27;s long-term streaming ambitions. CBS News could be combined with CNN to create a global news powerhouse. CBS&#x27; crime dramas, such as &quot;NCIS&quot; and &quot;Criminal Minds,&quot; could be combined with Investigation Discovery and TruTV. CBS Sports&#x27; footprint could be combined with WBD&#x27;s. For example, CBS and WBD&#x27;s Turner Sports currently share TV rights for March Madness.

Now, with Google Groups abandoning Usenet, this oldest of all social networks is doomed to disappear. Some might say it&#x27;s well past time. As Google declared, &quot;Over the last several years, legitimate activity in text-based Usenet groups has declined significantly because users have moved to more modern technologies and formats such as social media and web-based forums. Much of the content being disseminated via Usenet today is binary (non-text) file sharing, which Google Groups does not support, as well as spam.&quot; True, these days, Usenet&#x27;s content is almost entirely spam, but in its day, Usenet was everything that Twitter and Reddi…</span>

To be honest, it’s been a bit exhausting at times to concurrently argue on at least three major flanks. But that’s just how this year has turned out, given the work we’ve been pursuing.
Whether it’s telling people that you can save a lot of money by leaving the cloud, or that SaaS software might just have seen the peak, or that #nobuild is a viable path on the front-end, or any of the myriad of other minor technical heresies we’ve committed this year, it’s all come from believing the underlying thesis and living the conclusions!
And I think that’s part of what at times create such a flammable discourse. If you’ve staked your identity on a certain view of reality, say, The Cloud…</span>

                              <span>The Rust Async Working Group is excited to announce major progress towards our goal of enabling the use of async fn in traits. Rust 1.75, which hits stable next week, will include support for both -&gt; impl Trait notation and async fn in traits.
This is a big milestone, and we know many users will be itching to try these out in their own code. However, we are still missing some important features that many users need. Read on for recommendations on when and how to use the stabilized features.
What&#x27;s stabilizing
Ever since the stabilization of RFC #1522 in Rust 1.26, Rust has allowed users to write impl Trait as the return type of functions (often called &quot;RPIT&quot;). This means that the function returns &quot;some type that implements Trait&quot;. This is commonly used to return closures, iterators, and ot…</span>

Unsurprisingly, the system inundates employees with false &#x27;alerts&#x27; but the district nonetheless hails this pervasive, dystopic surveillance system as a great success. What useful advice can readers here offer regarding successful methods to get public officials to backtrack from a policy so corrosive to liberty, trust, and digital freedoms?

Kotick&#x27;s departure comes just two months after some big Xbox leadership changes that saw Sarah Bond promoted to Xbox president, leading all Xbox platform and hardware work, and Matt Booty promoted to president of game content and studios, including overseeing Bethesda and ZeniMax studios.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from the New York Times: The Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday proposed sweeping changes to bolster the key federal rule that has protected children&#x27;s privacy online, in one of the most significant attempts by the U.S. government to strengthen consumer privacy in more than a decade. The changes are intended to fortify the rules underlying the Children&#x27;s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, a law that restricts the online tracking of youngsters by services like social media apps, video game platforms, toy retailers and digital advertising networks. Regulators said the moves would &quot;shift the burden&quot; of online safety from parents to apps and other digital services while curbing how platforms may use and monetize children&#x27;s data.

                              <span>The PlayStation 5 has officially hit the 50 million sales milestone, Sony confirmed in a blog post. From a report: That&#x27;s an impressive figure, considering the litany of supply chain issues that kept PS5s in limited supply after its November 2020 launch. And notably, the PS5 manage to reach 50 million sales just a week longer than it took the PlayStation 4, which wasn&#x27;t bogged down by as many supply chain issues or a worldwide pandemic. Sony has also outsold the Xbox Series X and S by almost three to one this year, the Financial Times reports, based on data from Ampere Analysis.

From a report: A probe by the AG&#x27;s office found that Sirius trains employees to keep customers seeking to cancel on the phone or in a chat for a &quot;frustrating&quot; six-part conversation that includes asking them a series of questions and pitching as many as five &quot;retention offers,&quot; New York Attorney General Letitia James said Wednesday in a statement.

From a report: Users can enter prompts into Copilot like &quot;Create a pop song about adventures with your family&quot; and have Suno, via a plug-in, bring their musical ideas to life. From a single sentence, Suno can generate complete songs -- including lyrics, instrumentals and singing voices. 

Copilot users can access the Suno integration by launching Microsoft Edge, visiting Copilot.Microsoft.com, logging in with their Microsoft account and enabling the Suno plug-in or clicking on the Suno logo that says &quot;Make music with Suno.&quot; [...] AI algorithms &quot;learn&quot; from existing music to produce similar effects, a fact with which not all artists -- or GenAI users -- are comfortable, especially in cases where artists don&#x27;t consent to having an AI algorithm train on their music and didn&#x27;t receive compensation for it.

                              <span>Most companies are not ready to deploy generative AI at scale because they lack strong data infrastructure or the controls needed to make sure the technology is used safely, according to the chief executive of the consultancy Accenture. From a report: The most hyped technology of 2023 is in an experimental phase at most companies and macroeconomic uncertainty is holding back IT spending generally, Julie Sweet told the Financial Times in an interview ahead of the company publishing quarterly results on Tuesday. Accenture reported another big jump in revenues from generative AI projects in the three months to November 30, with $450mn in bookings compared with $300mn over the previous six months. But they remain small relative to group sales of $64bn annually. 

Corporate executives are keen to deploy the technology to understand data across their organisation better or to automate more customer service, Sweet said. &quot;The thing that is going to hold it back, though, isâ...âmost companies do not have mature data capabilities and if you can&#x27;t use your data, you can&#x27;t use AI. That said, in three to five years we expect this to be a big part of our business.&quot; Accenture and other consulting groups have boasted of multibillion-dollar investments in generative AI, including hiring and training staff, in the hope of a windfall from deploying the technology to clients across the world. 

Sweet said executives were being âoeprudentâ in rolling out the technology, amid concerns over how to protect proprietary information and customer data and questions about the accuracy of outputs from generative AI models. &quot;We are still at the stage where most CEOs, asked if there is someone in their organisation who can tell them where AI is being used, what the risks are and how they&#x27;re being mitigated, the answer is still &#x27;no.&#x27;&quot;

                              <span>The future of water may be changing in California. The state Water Resources Control Board has signed off on regulations to turn more recycled wastewater from our homes into drinking water. From a report: The regulations were approved unanimously by the board on Tuesday and now give the go-ahead for local water agencies to plan to turn wastewater into water we can drink through a process called Direct Potable Reuse. Darrin Polhemus, the division of drinking water director with the State Water Resources Control Board, said this approval was a very big step for California. &quot;It really will be the highest quality water delivered in the state when it&#x27;s done,&quot; Polhemus said. 

California&#x27;s new rules would let, but not require, local water agencies to take wastewater from toilets or showers, treat it, and then put it right back into the drinking water system. &quot;Direct potable reuse is just a really critical strategy for our state to have as we move to this new hydrology that we have, and as everyone has already said, increasing our resilience and reducing our reliance on imported water,&quot; said Laurel Firestone, board member for the State Water Resources Control Board.

                              <span>A worrying number of UK authorities are still unaware of the impending switch-off of 2G and 3G mobile networks, according to Local Government Association (LGA) figures. From a report: While 38 percent of respondents were fully aware, 27 percent were only partially aware, and 7 percent had no idea at all that the axe would be falling by 2033 at the latest. The numbers worsened when the researchers spoke to respondents in senior management. Almost half (48 percent) were &quot;partially aware&quot; the UK&#x27;s 2G and 3G mobile networks were due to be switched off and 14 percent were not at all aware. 

The actual switch-off will happen over the next few years. UK mobile operators have told government they do not intend to offer 2G and 3G mobile networks past 2033 at the latest, and there is a high likelihood that some networks will be shut down earlier. The UK government said it welcomes plans to end services ahead of time. Vodafone, for example, intends to pull the plug on 3G once and for all from January 2024. Although most consumers, with their 4G and 5G devices, will likely be unaware of the end when it comes, the same cannot be said of local authorities. According to the survey, almost two-thirds of respondents (63 percent) reported that their authority was still using devices or services reliant on 2G and 3G networks.

LAION told 404 Media on Tuesday that out of &quot;an abundance of caution,&quot; it was taking down its datasets temporarily &quot;to ensure they are safe before republishing them.&quot; According to a new study by the Stanford Internet Observatory shared with 404 Media ahead of publication, the researchers found the suspected instances of CSAM through a combination of perceptual and cryptographic hash-based detection and analysis of the images themselves.

                              <span>The European Union on Wednesday added three adult content companies - Pornhub, Stripchat and XVideos - to its list of firms subject to stringent regulations under new online content rules. From a report: The new rules, known as the Digital Services Act (DSA), require companies to conduct risk management, undergo external and independent auditing, and share data with authorities and researchers. In April, the EU designated five Alphabet subsidiaries, two Meta Platforms units, two Microsoft businesses, X and Alibaba&#x27;s AliExpress among 19 companies under the rules. Such designated companies will have to do more to tackle disinformation, give more protection and choice to users and ensure stronger protection for children or risk fines of as much as 6% of their global turnover. &quot;Pornhub, Stripchat and XVideos meet the user thresholds to fall under stricter #DSA obligations,&quot; the bloc&#x27;s industry chief Thierry Breton said. &quot;Creating a safer online environment for our children is an enforcement priority under the DSA.&quot;

                              <span>Bird Global, the company that pioneered on-street electric scooter rentals, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection [Editor&#x27;s note: the link is paywalled; alternative source] in Florida, five years after becoming the fastest start-up ever to reach a so-called &quot;unicorn&quot; valuation above $1bn. From a report: In September, the New York Stock Exchange suspended trading in Bird, which went public via a blank-cheque company in 2021, after its market capitalisation fell below a $15mn threshold. &quot;We are making progress towards profitability and aim to accelerate that progress by right-sizing our capital structure through this restructuring,&quot; Bird interim chief executive Michael Washinushi said on Wednesday. 

Bird said it would operate as normal during the restructuring process and that its lenders had entered into a &quot;stalking horse&quot; sale agreement. The company aims to complete a sale process within 120 days. Its European and Canadian businesses are not part of the bankruptcy filing. Founded by former Uber and Lyft executive Travis VanderZanden in Los Angeles in 2017, Bird spawned dozens of copycat companies around the world. But e-scooter rentals have struggled to reach consistent profitability, amid regulatory strictures, safety concerns, and high capital and operating costs.

                              <span>Juli Clover reports via MacRumors: The developers behind Beeper Mini are continuing with their effort to make iMessage for Android function despite Apple&#x27;s mitigations, and the latest &quot;fix&quot; requires Beeper Mini users to have access to a Mac. On Reddit, the Beeper Mini team says that the Mac-based fix coming on December 20 stabilizes iMessage for Beeper Cloud and Mini, and it &quot;works well&quot; and &quot;is very reliable.&quot;
 
It is unclear how many Android users have a Mac or have a friend with a Mac to rely on, but the fix requires using a Mac to connect to iMessage on Beeper. According to Beeper Mini&#x27;s developers, registration data from an actual Mac has to be sent to Apple to use iMessage on Beeper. Beeper has been using its own Mac servers to provide that information to Apple, but that resulted in thousands of Beeper users having the same registration info, which was an &quot;easy target for Apple.&quot;
 
The Beeper update will instead generate unique registration data for each Mac, making it harder for Apple to tell which users are accessing iMessage through an Android device. The Beeper Mini team says that registration data is &quot;only used to indicate that a Mac is available during registration&quot; and that the Mac will not be given access to an account or messages: &quot;If you do not have access to a Mac computer, but have a friend on Beeper with a Mac, you can ask them if you can use their registration data. In our testing, 10-20 iMessage users can safely use the same registration data.&quot; With the fix, Beeper Cloud and Beeper Mini users will once again be able to use iMessage on Android, but only with email addresses and not with phone numbers.

                              <span>An anonymous reader writes: Digital mapping specialist TomTom said on Tuesday it has partnered with tech giant Microsoft to create an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered conversational assistant for vehicles. The assistant will allow users to &quot;converse naturally with their vehicles&quot; and enable voice interaction with infotainment, location search, and vehicle command systems, the company said.
 
TomTom, which competes with Google Maps and the world&#x27;s biggest mapping platform HERE, used various Microsoft services like its Azure OpenAI Service to create the voice assistant. The Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service allows enterprises to leverage ChatGPT maker OpenAI&#x27;s large language models (LLM). The voice assistant can be integrated into other automotive infotainment systems and is also built into TomTom&#x27;s Digital Cockpit, an open, modular in-vehicle infotainment platform, the Dutch map maker said. The company began working with Microsoft in 2016, when it first started powering Azure Maps location services.

                              <span>The dream has come true. It’s now possible to build fast, modern web applications without transpiling or bundling either JavaScript or CSS. I’ve been working towards this personal nirvana ever since we begrudgingly started transpiling and bundling assets in the late 2000s. Browsers just weren’t good enough back then to avoid it. But they are now.
Here’s a chart of the 68 individual JavaScript files that we load in ONCE #1 via import maps. The waterfall is vertical. HTTP/2 ensures we scarcely pay any penalty for sending so many individual files, yet reap huge rewards with fine-grained cache expiration:

Perhaps our most productive one yet, in terms of total number of product improvements, new product developments, and open source extractions. But it’s only by looking back at the work from a distance that you can really appreciate it. So allow me to do that here. To appreciate the banner year of programming productivity that was 2023 at our company.
Before I get into the actual open source gifts we were able to share this year, though, I think it’s important to remark on the fact that 37signals is not an open-source software company. In the sense that we don’t make money from open source. We don’t sell service, hosting, training, or licenses. None of that stuff. We sell business software.

                              <span>Longtime Slashdot reader UnknowingFool writes: Microsoft has released a new software tool to remove printer software from HP that was installed without user permission or system need. A few weeks ago, users noticed that Windows Update installed HP printer software even if they did not have HP printers or printers at all. Affecting Windows 10 and 11, consumers reported that this update sometimes caused problems as it could rename their non-HP printers as HP printers causing some printing features to be inaccessible. Microsoft has not disclosed the root cause of the issue. The fix released by Microsoft requires users to download and run a dedicated troubleshooting tool available from Microsoft&#x27;s support site. &quot;There are four different versions of the troubleshooter, depending on whether you have the 32- or 64-bit version of an Arm or x86 version of Windows,&quot; notes Ars Technica. &quot;Microsoft will also release an additional recommended troubleshooting tool &#x27;in the coming weeks&#x27; that will fix the problem in Windows 11 upon a user&#x27;s request without requiring the download of a separate tool.&quot;

                              <span>Binance will pay $2.7 billion to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for evading federal law and operating an illegal derivatives exchange. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency exchange&#x27;s founder, Changpeng &quot;CZ&quot; Zhao, will pay $150 million.
 
&quot;The court finds Zhao and Binance violated the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations, imposes a $150 million civil monetary penalty personally against Zhao, and requires Binance to disgorge $1.35 billion of ill-gotten transaction fees and pay a $1.35 billion penalty to the CFTC,&quot; wrote the CFTC in a statement. CoinTelegraph reports: The approved settlement marks the conclusion of a long-running case against CZ and Binance by the CFTC. On Nov. 21, CZ agreed to step down from his role at the helm of Binance as part of a wider settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, the Treasury Department and the CFTC. On the same day, Zhao pleaded guilty to several civil charges and one criminal charge relating to Anti-Money Laundering laws. On Dec. 7, CZ was ordered to remain in the U.S. until his Feb. 23, 2024 sentencing date. He faces up to 18 months in prison on money laundering charges and has agreed not to appeal any potential sentence up to that length.
 
As part of the settlement, both CZ and Binance have agreed to take further steps to ensure Know Your Customer measures are maintained on the exchange as well as requiring Binance to implement a formalized corporate governance structure, including a board of directors with independent members, a compliance committee and an audit committee. The court also made a separate order for Binance&#x27;s former chief compliance officer, Samuel Lim, to pay a $1.5 million civil monetary penalty for &quot;aiding and abetting Binance&#x27;s violations and engaging in activities outside of the U. S. to willfully evade or attempt to evade U.S. law.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from the BBC: A bill that mandates tech giants pay news outlets for their content has come into effect in Canada amid an ongoing dispute with Facebook and Instagram owner Meta over the law. Some have hailed it as a game-changer that sets out a permanent framework that will see a steady drip of funds from wealthy tech companies to Canada&#x27;s struggling journalism industry. But it has also been met with resistance by Google and Meta -- the only two companies big enough to be encompassed by the law. In response, over the summer, Meta blocked access to news on Facebook and Instagram for Canadians. Google looked set to follow, but after months of talks, the federal government was able to negotiate a deal with the search giant as the company has agreed to pay Canadian news outlets $75 million annually.
 
No such agreement appears to be on the horizon with Meta, which has called the law &quot;fundamentally flawed.&quot; If Meta is refusing to budge, so is the government. &quot;We will continue to push Meta, that makes billions of dollars in profits, even though it is refusing to invest in the journalistic rigor and stability of the media,&quot; Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters on Friday. According to a study by the Media Ecosystem Observatory, the views of Canadian news on Facebook dropped 90% after the company blocked access to news on the platform. Local news outlets have been hit particularly hard.
 
&quot;The loss of journalism on Meta platforms represents a significant decline in the resiliency of the Canadian media ecosystem,&quot; said Taylor Owen, a researcher at McGill and the co-author of the study. He believes it also hurts Meta&#x27;s brand in the long run, pointing to the fact that the Canada&#x27;s federal government, as well as that of British Columbia, other municipalities and a handful of large Canadian corporations, have all pulled their advertising off Facebook and Instagram in retaliation.

                              <span>Imported raw materials such as steel and cement will incur a new carbon tax from 2027 under UK plans designed to support domestic producers and reduce emissions, but the government is facing criticism for not moving fast enough. From a report: The Treasury said the tax would help address the phenomenon of &quot;carbon leakage,&quot; in which UK manufacturers are undercut on price by foreign rivals whose governments do not impose levies on businesses that emit a lot of carbon. The result is that emissions are simply displaced to other countries, while greener UK producers lose out because they have to pay carbon-related charges. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said: &quot;This levy will make sure carbon intensive products from overseas -- like steel and ceramics -- face a comparable carbon price to those produced in the UK, so that our decarbonisation efforts translate into reductions in global emissions. &quot;This should give UK industry the confidence to invest in decarbonisation as the world transitions to net zero.&quot;

                              <span>Speaking of the 1.3 million stolen files of Sony division Insomniac Games that hackers have leaked, the data dump includes game roadmaps, budgets, and detailed information about Insomniac&#x27;s upcoming Wolverine game, which a document says is slated for 2026. Bloomberg reports: According to the files, Sony plans to release several Marvel-inspired titles in the next decade, including Spider-Man 3, based on Venom and X-Men games. The files also reference a new Ratchet &amp; Clank game apparently slated for 2029. Insomniac and Marvel&#x27;s licensing commitment is as high as $621 million to develop and market the X-Men games by 2035, according to one document, which was one of many circulating on the internet. The documents also give us a peak into how Sony internally felt about Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition of Blizzard. Eurogamer adds: Sony has privately described Microsoft&#x27;s $68.7bn takeover of Activision Blizzard as a potential &quot;leapfrog&quot; moment for its long-term console rival to take the lead. Threats identified by Sony include Microsoft using Call of Duty to &quot;disrupt and threaten console gaming and game subscription markets&quot;, with a potential &quot;massive threat to PlayStation Plus.&quot; [...] &quot;Activision provides incredible strategic value across live service games, scale in mobile and PC storefront (Battle.net),&quot; Sony wrote, describing the various advantages Microsoft has now added to its portfolio with the deal freshly completed.

                              <span>A anonymous reader shares a report: Shopping on Amazon.com has long entailed scrolling through pages and pages of often redundant customer feedback. In an effort to make the task less onerous, the company in August began using artificial intelligence to convert billions of reviews into brief summaries consisting of a few sentences apiece. As is often true with generative AI, the results aren&#x27;t perfect. In some cases, the summaries provide an inaccurate description of a product. In others, they exaggerate negative feedback. This has potential implications not just for customers, but for Amazon merchants who depend on positive reviews to boost sales. Making matters worse, merchants say, the summaries were deployed just as they were headed into the crucial holiday shopping season -- giving them one more thing to worry about besides inflation-battered shoppers. 

Most shoppers can probably tell when the AI has misclassified a product. For example, the home fitness company Teeter sells an inversion table designed to ease back pain. Amazon&#x27;s AI generated summary calls it a desk: &quot;Customers like the sturdiness, adjustability and pain relief of the desk.&quot; The technology&#x27;s tendency to overplay negative sentiment in some reviews is less obvious. The $70 Brass Birmingham board game, for instance, boasts a 4.7-star rating based on feedback from more than 500 shoppers. A three-sentence AI summary of reviews ends with: &quot;However, some customer have mixed opinions on ease of use.&quot; Only four reviews mention ease of use in a way that could be interpreted as critical. That&#x27;s fewer than 1% of the overall ratings, yet the negative sentiment accounts for about a third of the AI-generated blurb.

                              <span>Toshiba will be delisted on Wednesday after 74 years on the Tokyo exchange, following a decade of upheaval and scandal that brought down one of Japan&#x27;s biggest brands and ushered in a buyout and an uncertain future. From a report: The conglomerate is being taken private by a group of investors led by private equity firm Japan Industrial Partners that also includes financial services firm Orix, utility Chubu Electric Power and chipmaker Rohm. The $14 billion takeover puts Toshiba in domestic hands after protracted battles with overseas activist investors that paralysed the maker of batteries, chips, and nuclear and defence equipment. Although it is not clear what shape Toshiba will ultimately take under its new owners, Chief Executive Taro Shimada, who is staying in his role following the buyout, is expected to focus on high-margin digital services.

                              <span>A ransomware group that claimed to have successfully hacked Insomniac Games has now leaked the vast majority of its stolen files. From a report: Last week ransomware group Rhysida threatened to expose sensitive data about the company, its employees and its upcoming games, if it wasn&#x27;t paid for the data. It then published data online which appeared to corroborate its claim that it had successfully hacked the Sony-owned studio, including an annotated screenshot from Insomniac&#x27;s upcoming Wolverine game. 

The group then threatened to publish the stolen data within seven days, but first offered it for auction with a starting price of 50 Bitcoins (approximately $2 million). Now, according to Cyber Daily, Rhysida has followed through with its threat and posted more than 1.3 million files totalling 1.67 terabytes to its darknet leak site. Around 98% of the hacked data has been leaked, with Rhysida stating that &quot;not sold data was uploaded,&quot; implying that the remaining 2% may have been sold to someone.

                              <span>An international group of law enforcement agencies have seized the dark web leak site of the notorious ransomware gang known as ALPHV, or BlackCat. From a report: &quot;The Federal Bureau of Investigation seized this site as part of a coordinated law enforcement action taken against ALPHV Blackcat Ransomware,&quot; a message on the gang&#x27;s dark web leak site now reads, seen by TechCrunch. According to the splash, the takedown operation also involved law enforcement agencies from the United Kingdom, Denmark, Germany, Spain and Australia. 

In a later announcement confirming the disruption, the U.S. Department of Justice said that the international takedown effort, led by the FBI, enabled U.S. authorities to gain visibility into the ransomware group&#x27;s computer to seize &quot;several websites&quot; that ALPHV operated. The FBI also released a decryption tool that has already enabled more than 500 ALPHV ransomware victims to restore their systems. (The government&#x27;s search warrant puts the number at 400 victims.) The FBI said it worked with dozens of victims in the United States, saving them from paying ransom demands totaling approximately $68 million.

From a report: The South Asian nation is already the world&#x27;s largest guzzler of groundwater. Cheap power has encouraged routine overreliance on finite riches. India overwhelmingly grows some of the thirstiest crops: rice, wheat and sugar cane. Over the last half century, farm productivity has leapt forward, but so, too, has water usage -- up 500% over that period, according to the World Bank. Erratic monsoons and brutal heat waves are only making the problem more acute. Farmers are digging deeper wells because existing ones are no longer refilling. Some regions may run out of groundwater entirely -- Punjab, a major wheat producer, could go dry within the next 15 or so years, according to a…</span>

The two affected companies are Nirvana Finance, a decentralized crypto exchange, and an unnamed exchange on the Solana blockchain platform that Ahmed hacked using his blockchain audit and smart contract reverse engineering skills. He first targeted the undisclosed crypto exchange by manipulating a smart contract to introduce false pricing data, generating roughly $9 million worth of inflated fees. Ahmed later withdrew the funds and offered to return all but $1.5 million on the condition that the exchange refrained from involving law enforcement.

                              <span>Just over a year ago, we announced our intention to leave the cloud. We then shared our complete $3.2 million cloud budget for 2022, and the fact that we were going to build our own tooling rather than pay for overpriced enterprise service contracts. The mission was set!
A month later, we placed an order for $600,000 worth of Dell servers to carry our exit, and did the math to conservatively estimate $7 million in savings over the next five years. We also detailed the larger values, beyond just cost, that was driving our cloud exit. Things like independence and loyalty to the original ethos of the internet.
Still in February, we announced the new tool I had bootstrapped in a few weeks to take us out of the cloud – without giving up on all the innovation in containers and operating principl…</span>

                              <span>Ron Amadeo reports via Ars Technica: Stadia might be dead, but the controllers for Google&#x27;s cloud-based gaming platform are still out there. With the service permanently offline, the proprietary Stadia Controller threatened to fill up landfills until Google devised a plan to convert them to generic Bluetooth devices that can work on almost anything. The app to open up the controller to other devices is a web service, which previously had a shutdown date of December 2023. That apparently isn&#x27;t enough time to convert all these controllers, so the Stadia Controller Salvage operation will run for a whole additional year. X (formerly Twitter) user Wario64 was the first to spot the announcement, which says the online tool will continue running until December 31, 2024.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: Trevor Milton, the disgraced founder and former CEO of electric truck startup Nikola, was sentenced Monday to four years in prison for securities fraud. The sentence, by Judge Edgardo Ramos in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, caps a multi-year saga that at one point sent Nikola stock soaring 83% only to come crashing down months later over accusations of fraud and canceled contracts. The sentencing hearing comes after four separate delays, during which Milton has remained free under a $100 million bond.
 
In his ruling, Ramos said he would impose a sentence of 48 months on each count, served concurrently, and a fine of $1 million. Milton is expected to appeal the sentence, which Ramos acknowledged. Milton sobbed as he pled with Judg…</span>

                              <span>Flipboard, the social media magazine and news app, announced that it is starting to switch its user accounts to ActivityPub, a technology developed by the World Wide Web Consortium that makes social networks interoperable, &quot;connecting everything to a single social graph and content-sharing system,&quot; reports The Verge. From the report: Right now, only 25 accounts have been federated with ActivityPub, but by March Flipboard says it plans to allow anyone on the platform to open their account to the fediverse and allow any Flipboard user to follow any fediverse account from within the Flipboard app. At that point, Flipboard will essentially be an ActivityPub-based platform like Mastodon or Pixelfed but with an interface designed for reading articles instead of bite-sized posts. It&#x27;ll be the biggest thing in the fediverse -- at least until Threads shows up for real.
 
&quot;Basically, we&#x27;re in the process of replacing our whole social back-end with ActivityPub,&quot; says Flipboard CEO Mike McCue. &quot;I think Flipboard is going to be the first mainstream consumer service that existed in a walled garden that switches over to ActivityPub.&quot;

Two months ago, Apple lost a patent case over the technology its smartwatches use to detect people&#x27;s pulse rate. The company was ordered to stop selling the Apple Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2 after Christmas, which could set off a run on sales of the watches in the final week of holiday shopping.
The move by Apple follows a ruling by the International Trade Commission in October that found several Apple Watches infringe on patents held by Masimo, a medical technology company in Irvine, Calif.

                              <span>Travel website Expedia wants to get people to start their travel search on its site with AI instead of using an external search engine. From a report: Expedia already uses AI for some customer service features and to help property owners describe their homes and hotels. The company hopes in the future that AI will help it recommend travel destinations to customers based on previous trips and bring more direct traffic to its site. It&#x27;s a long-term plan to shift the balance of power on the web -- albeit one that&#x27;s still in its earliest stages for the company. 

Rajesh Naidu, chief architect and head of data management at Expedia, says the goal is to get users started on their trips in one place. Expedia hopes to produce recommendations trained with its library of flight and hotel information and informed by users&#x27; travel preferences. &quot;By being able to train large language models on our data, this rich 70 petabytes&#x27; worth of data we&#x27;ve gathered over the years, we can eventually recommend places to go and stay and do and continue to refine and personalize that,&quot; Naidu tells The Verge in an interview. According to Naidu, when people plan trips, they often start by going to a search engine to look for a destination. Only then do they visit services like Expedia to start booking travel and accommodation. There&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with going to Google and typing &quot;best vacation that isn&#x27;t cold and not that far from New York,&quot; but Naidu believes there&#x27;s value in streamlining the travel planning process even more.

                              <span>Hackers stole the sensitive personal information of more than 14.6 million Mr. Cooper customers, the mortgage and loan giant has confirmed. From a report: In a filing with Maine&#x27;s attorney general&#x27;s office, Mr. Cooper said the hackers stole customer names, addresses, dates of birth and phone numbers, as well as customer Social Security numbers and bank account numbers. Mr. Cooper previously said that customer banking information was stored by a third-party company and believed to be unaffected. Mr. Cooper said in a separate filing with federal regulators on Friday that hackers obtained personal data on &quot;substantially all of our current and former customers.&quot; 

The number of affected victims is significantly higher than the four million existing customers that Mr. Cooper claims on its website, likely because of the historical data that the company stores on mortgage holders. Mr. Cooper said in its data breach notification letter to affected victims that the stolen data includes personal information on those whose mortgage was previously acquired or serviced by the company when it was known as Nationstar Mortgage, prior to its rebranding as Mr. Cooper. The company said affected customers may include those whose mortgages were serviced by a sister brand.

                              <span>OpenAI, the AI company behind ChatGPT, laid out its plans for staying ahead of what it thinks could be serious dangers of the tech it develops, such as allowing bad actors to learn how to build chemical and biological weapons. From a report: OpenAI&#x27;s &quot;Preparedness&quot; team, led by MIT AI professor Aleksander Madry, will hire AI researchers, computer scientists, national security experts and policy professionals to monitor its tech, continually test it and warn the company if it believes any of its AI capabilities are becoming dangerous. The team sits between OpenAI&#x27;s &quot;Safety Systems&quot; team, which works on existing problems like infusing racist biases into AI, and the company&#x27;s &quot;Superalignment&quot; team, which researches how to make sure AI doesn&#x27;t harm humans in an imagined future where the tech has outstripped human intelligence completely. 

[...] Madry, a veteran AI researcher who directs MIT&#x27;s Center for Deployable Machine Learning and co-leads the MIT AI Policy Forum, joined OpenAI earlier this year. He was one of a small group of OpenAI leaders who quit when Altman was fired by the company&#x27;s board in November. Madry returned to the company when Altman was reinstated five days later. OpenAI, which is governed by a nonprofit board whose mission is to advance AI and make it helpful for all humans, is in the midst of selecting new board members after three of the four board members who fired Altman stepped down as part of his return. Despite the leadership &quot;turbulence,&quot; Madry said he believes OpenAI&#x27;s board takes seriously the risks of AI that he is researching. &quot;I realized if I really want to shape how AI is impacting society, why not go to a company that is actually doing it?&quot;

                              <span>AI allowed Pakistan&#x27;s former prime minister Imran Khan to campaign from behind bars on Monday, with a voice clone of the opposition leader giving an impassioned speech on his behalf. From a report: Khan has been locked up since August and is being tried for leaking classified documents, allegations he says have been trumped up to stop him contesting general elections due in February. His Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party used artificial intelligence to make a four-minute message from the 71-year-old, headlining a &quot;virtual rally&quot; hosted on social media overnight on Sunday into Monday despite internet disruptions that monitor NetBlocks said were consistent with previous attempts to censor Khan. 

PTI said Khan sent a shorthand script through lawyers that was fleshed out into his rhetorical style. The text was then dubbed into audio using a tool from the AI firm ElevenLabs, which boasts the ability to create a &quot;voice clone&quot; from existing speech samples. &quot;My fellow Pakistanis, I would first like to praise the social media team for this historic attempt,&quot; the voice mimicking Khan said. &quot;Maybe you all are wondering how I am doing in jail,&quot; the stilted voice adds. &quot;Today, my determination for real freedom is very strong.&quot; The audio was broadcast at the end of a five-hour live-stream of speeches by PTI supporters on Facebook, X and YouTube, and was overlaid with historic footage of Khan and still images.

                              <span>A bipartisan group of lawmakers has written to U.S. President Joe Biden, warning European technology regulation are unfairly targeting U.S. companies and not including many Chinese or EU firms, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Monday. From the report: Under the European Union&#x27;s Digital Markets Act (DMA), five major U.S. tech companies -- Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft -- were designated &quot;gatekeeper&quot; service providers. From March 2024, these companies -- as well as TikTok&#x27;s Chinese owner ByteDance -- will be required to make their messaging apps work with rivals and let users choose which ones they want pre-installed on their devices. 

In a letter seen by Reuters, 21 members of the U.S. House of Representatives warned the new rules could damage American economic and security interests and called on Biden to secure commitments from the EU the rules will be enforced fairly. &quot;Securing our leadership in this sector is imperative for our economy and American workers,&quot; the letter said. &quot;The designation of leading U.S. companies as &#x27;gatekeepers&#x27; threatens to upend the U.S. economy, diminish our global leadership in the digital sphere, and jeopardize the security of consumers.&quot; 

The letter questioned why Chinese companies Alibaba, Huawei, and Tencent had avoided designation and why European companies had avoided any scrutiny. &quot;The EU inexplicably failed to designate any European retailers, content-sharing platforms, payment firms, and telcos,&quot; it said. Signatories of the letter -- including Representative Lou Correa, a Democrat, and Thomas Massie, a Republican, -- called on Biden to seek assurances from EU lawmakers the DMA will not be unfairly used to target U.S. companies.

                              <span>Following a tumultuous few weeks for Beeper, which has been trying to provide an iMessage-compatible Android app, a group of US lawmakers are pushing for the DOJ to investigate Apple for &quot;potentially anticompetitive conduct&quot; over its attempts to disable Beeper&#x27;s services. From a report: Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Mike Lee (R-UT) as well as Representatives Jerry Nadler (D-NY) and Ken Buck (R-CO) said in a letter to the DOJ that Beeper&#x27;s Android messaging app, Beeper Mini, was a threat to Apple&#x27;s leverage by &quot;creating [a] more competitive mobile applications market, which in turn [creates] a more competitive mobile device market.&quot; 

In an interview with CBS News on Monday, Beeper CEO Eric Migicovsky and 16-year-old developer James Gill talked about the fight to keep Beeper Mini alive. Migicovsky told CBS News that Beeper is trying to provide a service people want and reiterated his belief that Apple has a monopoly over its iMessage service. The company created Beeper Mini after being contacted by Gill, who said he reverse-engineered the software by &quot;poking at it&quot; using a &quot;real Mac and a real iPhone.&quot; [...] The lawmakers&#x27; letter also pointed to a Department of Commerce report calling Apple a &quot;gatekeeper,&quot; mirroring language used in the EU Digital Markets Act (DMA) that went into force earlier this year, regulating the &quot;core&quot; services of several tech platforms (though, notably, iMessage may not be included in this). They went on to cite Migicovsky&#x27;s December 2021 Senate Judiciary Committee testimony that &quot;the dominant messaging services would use their position to impose barriers to interoperability&quot; and keep companies like Beeper from offering certain services. &quot;Given Apple&#x27;s recent actions, that concern appears prescient,&quot; they added.

                              <span>Southwest Airlines is still paying for its meltdown during the 2022 holidays that stranded millions of travelers -- and the tab is growing. From a report: The U.S. Transportation Department has ordered Southwest to pay a $140 million civil penalty, part of a broader consent order after the airline&#x27;s operational failures a year ago. That penalty is by far the largest the DOT has ever levied for consumer protection violations, according to a statement from the department. &quot;This is not just about Southwest,&quot; Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in an interview with NPR&#x27;s Morning Edition on Monday. &quot;This is about the entire industry, sending a signal that you should not be cutting corners -- because if you fail your passengers, we will hold you accountable.&quot; 

A major winter storm last December caused travel disruptions across the country as airlines canceled thousands of flights. But while other airlines recovered relatively quickly, Southwest fell apart. The airline ultimately canceled 16,900 flights, stranding more than 2 million passengers. In a statement, Southwest described the agreement as &quot;a consumer-friendly settlement.&quot; The airline says it has taken steps since last year&#x27;s disruption to improve its operational resiliency and customer care.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: As Russian troops poured into Ukraine at the start of Vladimir Putin&#x27;s invasion in February last year, alarm was rising at a flagship Kremlin nuclear project in neighboring Belarus, just a short distance from the European Union&#x27;s border. Engineers at Rosatom preparing a new 1,200-megawatt reactor, which was not yet connected to the power grid, to generate electricity at the Astravets Nuclear Power Plant detected a mysterious and exceedingly rare problem. Resin was seeping into the primary circuit, threatening to seize up critical components, according to internal documents of the Russian state nuclear corporation seen by Bloomberg.

                              <span>The giants of the consulting world face an unusual quandary this year: many of them are in the process of dismissing hundreds of staffers even after they hired thousands of college graduates to deal with new demand. Now, one of the biggest of them all is looking to AI to change that. From a report: Deloitte is using AI to evaluate existing staffers&#x27; skills and map out plans that would shift employees away from quieter parts of the business and into roles that are more in demand. It&#x27;s part of a broader bet by the professional services firm that the technology will allow it to moderate hiring growth over time. 

The moves come after Deloitte added 130,000 staffers this year. But in the midst of those hirings, though, the firm warned thousands of staffers in the US and UK that their jobs were at risk of becoming redundant after the company was forced to restructure certain areas of the business in response to a slowdown in demand. &quot;It is obviously a great objective to be able to avoid large swings of hirings and layoffs,&quot; said Stevan Rolls, global chief talent officer at Deloitte. &quot;You could always be more efficient and effective about finding the right people.&quot;

From a report: As a result of the termination, Adobe will be required to pay Figma a reverse termination fee of $1 billion in cash. &quot;Adobe and Figma strongly disagree with the recent regulatory findings, but we believe it is in our respective best interests to move forward independently,&quot; said Adobe chair and CEO Shantanu Narayen in a statement. &quot;While Adobe and Figma shared a vision to jointly redefine the future of creativity and productivity, we continue to be well positioned to capitalize on our massive market opportunity and mission to change the world through personalized digital experiences.&quot;

&quot;Researchers who want to empower individual artists have recently created a tool named &#x27;Nightshade&#x27; to fight back against unauthorised image scraping.&quot;
The tool works by subtly altering an image&#x27;s pixels in a way that wreaks havoc to computer vision but leaves the image unaltered to a human&#x27;s eyes.... This can result in the algorithm mistakenly learning to classify an image as something a human would visually know to be untrue. As a result, the generator can start returning unpredictable and unintended results... [A] balloon might become an egg. A request for an image in the style of Monet might instead return an image in the style…</span>

As with any new development, there are a million little details we need to nail for a successful launch that’s up to our standards. That’s usually where the temptation to cut corners on internal quality beckons, but we’ve handcuffed ourselves to the virtue of beautiful code by committing to shipping the code with purchase. It’s working!
Not just because I don’t want other people to see any dirty hacks or dusty corners. This is a positive vision. We’re shipping the code because I want to show everyone that an extremely high level of care for the internals is not in opposition to the demands of commercial deadlines. In fact, I’d go so far as to say such case is in service of said deadlines.

Since 2016, the Rust Project has collected valuable information and feedback from the Rust programming language community through our annual State of Rust Survey. This tool allows us to more deeply understand how the Rust Project is performing, how we can better serve the global Rust community, and who our community is composed of.
Like last year, the 2023 State of Rust Survey will likely take you between 10 and 25 minutes, and responses are anonymous. We will accept submissions until Monday, January 15th, 2024. Trends and key insights will be shared on blog.rust-lang.org as soon as possible in 2024.
We invite you to take this year’s survey whether you have just begun using Rust, you consider yourself an intermediate to advanced user, or you have not yet used Rust but intend to one day. Your responses will help us improve Rust over time by shedding light on gaps to fill in the community and development priorities, and more.
Once again, we are offering the State of Rust Survey in the following languages (if you speak multiple languages, please pick one). Language options are available on the main survey page:
English
Simplified Chinese
French
German
Japanese
Russian
Spanish
Please help us spread the word by sharing the survey link via your social media networks, at meetups, with colleagues, and in any other community that makes sense to you.
This survey would not be possible without the time, resources, and attention of members of the Survey Working Group, the Rust Foundation, and other collaborators. Thank you!
If you have any questions, please see our frequently asked questions.
We appreciate your participation!

                              <span>Long-time Slashdot reader theodp writes: For the soundtracks to their 2023 holiday season ads, both Amazon and Apple turned to music by members of The Beatles. Amazon&#x27;s Joy Ride, which stars three older women reliving their youthful joy at a sledding hill, is set to a cover of The Beatles&#x27; In My Life. Apple&#x27;s Fuzzy Feelings, which tells the story of a young woman with a grumpy boss, is set to George Harrison&#x27;s Isn&#x27;t It a Pity. Product placement is present in both ads — Amazon features padded seat cushions that protect the seniors&#x27; tushes and the Amazon app used to order them, while Apple showcases the iPhone 15 Pro Max used to capture the ad&#x27;s stop-motion animation scenes and the MacBook Air used to edit them. Amazon&#x27;s 60-second ad has 542K views on YouTube, while Apple&#x27;s 4-minute ad has 16+ million views.

 &quot;(The rocks) in the box right now are about 1,600 degrees Celsius,&quot; Andrew Ponec said, standing next to a thermal battery the size of a small building. That is nearly 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, &quot;Hotter than the melting point of steel,&quot; he explained. 

But what makes his box of white-hot rocks so significant is they were not heated by burning tons of coal or gas, but by catching sunlight with the thousands of photovoltaic solar panels that surround his prototype west of Fresno. If successful, Ponec and his start-up Antora Energy could be part of a new, multi-trillion-dollar energy storage sector that simply uses sun or wind to make boxes of rocks hot enough to run the world&#x27;s biggest factories. &quot;People sometimes feel like they&#x27;re insulting u…</span>

Unlike many of the company&#x27;s announcements, this heralds no big breakthrough. In a low-key research paper, the team describes a technique that lets a less powerful large language model supervise a more powerful one — and suggests that this might be a small step toward figuring out how humans might supervise superhuman machines.... 

Many researchers still question whether machines will ever match human intelligence, let alone outmatch it. OpenAI&#x27;s team takes machines&#x27; eventual superiority as given. &quot;AI progress in the last few years h…</span>

 All 35 FRBs were found in the lower part of the frequency spectrum, each with its unique energy signature. &quot;This work is exciting because it provides both confirmation of known FRB properties and the discovery of some new ones,&quot; said the SETI Institute&#x27;s Dr. Sofia Sheikh, NSF MPS-Ascend Postdoctoral Fellow and lead author. &quot;We&#x27;re narrowing down the source of FRBs, for example, to extreme objects such as magnetars, but no existing model can explain all of the properties that have been observed so far.

And this week he shared an unusual announcement with Slashdot. &quot;We&#x27;ve developed an AI that uses computer vision to recognize guns, rifles, knives, robber masks and tactical vests. 

&quot;We want to help the community, so we&#x27;ve made an open-source version of this free (as in beer and speech) for schools and religious organizations. The code is on Github. We welcome deployments, refinements, and feedback!&quot;

                              <span>A system of lagoons has been discovered in Argentina hosting a rare range of microbial communities previously unknown to scientists. The microbial communities form giant mounds of rock as they grow — like corals building a reef millimeter by millimeter. And the University of Colorado points out that &quot;the communities could also provide scientists with an unprecedented look at how life may have arisen on Mars, which resembled Earth billions of years ago.&quot; 

&quot;If life ever evolved on Mars to the level of fossils, it would have been like this,&quot; said geologist Brian Hynek, a professor in the department of geological sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder, who helped document the ecosystem. &quot;Understanding these modern communities on Earth could inform us about what we should look for as we search for similar features in the Martian rocks.&quot; 

more details from CNN:
 Stromatolites are layered rocks created by the growth of blue-green algae, or cyanobacteria, through photosynthesis. The structures are considered to be one of the oldest ecosystems on Earth, according to NASA, representing the earliest fossil evidence for life on our planet from at least 3.5 billion years ago. &quot;These are certainly akin to some of the earliest macrofossils on our planet, and in really a rare type of environment on modern Earth,&quot; said Hynek... 

While the stromatolites are in an environment containing oxygen, Hynek said he believes the layers farther down in the rock have little to no access to oxygen and are actively formed by microbes using anoxygenic photosynthesis. This would make the structures similar to the ones found on ancient Earth... &quot;We&#x27;ve identified more than 600 ancient lakes on Mars; there may have even been an ocean. So, it was a lot more Earth-like early on,&quot; he said.

                              <span>Forbes recently published this article by author/speaker Nina Xiang, who reports that Huawei is pushing forward with &quot;an amibitious plan to dethrone Android.&quot;
Hundreds of technical experts from many of China&#x27;s biggest state-owned and private companies, including the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Telecom, Meituan, and Baidu, all gathered in Beijing last month. The purpose behind the meeting was for their staff to receive training so they could be certified as developers on Huawei&#x27;s Harmony Operation System (OS). 

While most observers were looking the other way, Huawei has been quietly building an independent Chinese operating system that isn&#x27;t subject to U.S. sanctions. In the four years after the telecom giant was banned from using Google apps, the Shenzhen-based company has been making significant strides toward achieving its long-term goal: To dethrone Android and make its HarmonyOS the default operating system in China. 

Looking at the data for smartphone sales in China shows that HarmonyOS had the third-largest share with 10% in the second quarter of 2023, thanks to a strong resurgence in sales of Huawei smartphones. Although it&#x27;s still well below Android&#x27;s dominant 72%, it&#x27;s not far from iOS&#x27;s 17%... Huawei already says more than 700 million devices (including phones, smart devices, computers, and others) were equipped with HarmonyOS as of August this year, with over 2.2 million developers actively building within the ecosystem... 

A key moment will come next year, when Huawei says HarmonyOS will no longer be compatible with Android apps.

                              <span>Of the 15,000 satellites humans have sent into space, &quot;just over half are still functioning,&quot; reports CNN. &quot;The rest, after running out of fuel and ending their serviceable life, have either burned up in the atmosphere or are still orbiting the planet as useless hunks of metal&quot; — scattering &quot;an aura of space junk around the planet.&quot; 

 &quot;One way to start tackling the problem would be to stop producing more junk — by refueling satellites rather than decommissioning them once they run out of power.&quot;


&quot;Right now you can&#x27;t refuel a satellite on orbit,&quot; says Daniel Faber, CEO of Orbit Fab. But his Colorado-based company wants to change that... &quot;The lack of fuel creates a whole paradigm where people design their spacecraft missions around moving as little as possible.

                              <span>&quot;Associates of Elon Musk are planning to launch a new primary and secondary school,&quot; reports CNN, &quot;and ultimately a university, in Austin, Texas, with the help of a nearly $100 million donation from the billionaire, tax documents show...&quot;

Members of Musk&#x27;s inner circle — including Jared Birchall, who runs Musk&#x27;s family office — are named as leaders of The Foundation, a new school planning to teach &quot;STEM subjects and other topics,&quot; in an application to the Internal Revenue Service asking for tax-exempt status last year... The IRS filing, dated October 2022, was obtained and posted publicly by Bloomberg, which first reported plans for the school on Wednesday... &quot;The School is being designed to meet the educational needs of those with proven academic and scientific potential, who will thrive in a rigorous, project based curriculum,&quot; the filing posted by Bloomberg states. 
The school plans to initially enroll about 50 students and grow over time, according to the filing. It expects to be funded through donations and tuition fees, although it notes that the school will offer scholarships to support students who couldn&#x27;t otherwise afford to attend... &quot;The School intends ultimately to expand its operations to create a university dedicated to education at the highest levels,&quot; according to the filing... 
The Foundation said in its filing said that it had raised around $100 million in contributions since mid-2022 for the new Austin school. The 2022 annual 990 tax filing for the Musk Foundation, also made public by Bloomberg, notes that the Musk charity donated $10 million in cash to the group that year, as well as nearly $90 million worth of Tesla stock.

If you don&#x27;t laugh, you will cry, and that marks the beginning of a very slippery slope. As civilization faces a threat that dwarfs that of every war ever fought combined, and the outcome of the latest climate COP offers little hope, it&#x27;s something we need — not only to remember — but to actively adopt as a weapon in our armoury to fight for a better future for our children and their children. They say that laughter is the best medicine, but weaponised comedy has the potential to do more than just make us feel good. Not only can it help inform and educate about global heating and the climate breakdown it is driving, but…</span>

 Scientists have long viewed Saturn&#x27;s moon Enceladus, which harbors an ocean beneath its thick, icy shell, as one of the best places to search for life beyond Earth. Now, a new analysis of data collected by NASA&#x27;s Cassini mission, which orbited Saturn and its moons between 2004 and 2017, has uncovered intriguing evidence that further supports the idea of Enceladus as a habitable ocean world. 


Enceladus initially captured the attention of scientists in 2005 because plumes of ice grains and water vapor were observed rising through cracks in the moon&#x27;s ice shell and releasing into space. The spacecraft flew through the plumes and &quot;sampled&quot; them, with data suggesting the presence of organic compounds within the plumes, some of which are key f…</span>

                              <span>I continue to see new B2B software startups struggle with native mobile apps. Consumer software makers can usually start by going all-in on a single platform, but for business tools, that’s rarely an option. So they must face the tall task of tackling web, iOS, and Android at the same time. Hence the proliferation of toolkits like React Native, Turbo Native, and a hundred other frameworks vying to ease the pain. But it still hurts.
And it’s practically impossible for a single developer to be able to do it all anyway. The problem space is just too large. Which means the barrier to becoming competitive require ropes of external funding to scale. If technical founder teams can’t do it themselves, they have to hire, and if they have to hire, they have to raise capital.
I hate that. We built Ba…</span>

 The quest for new antibiotics is going back to the Stone Age. The urgency to identify possible candidates has never been greater as the global population faces nearly 5 million deaths every year that are associated with microbial resistance, according to the World Health Organization. A research team led by bioengineering pioneer César de la Fuente is using artificial intelligence-based computational methods to mine genetic information from extinct human relatives such as Neanderthals and long-gone ice age creatures such as the woolly mammoth and giant sloth. The scientists say some of these small protein, or peptide, molecules they have identified have bacteria-fighting powers that may inspire new drugs to fight infections in humans. The…</span>

The U.S. doubts whether Huawei Technologies Co. can produce the advanced chip in its new smartphone at the scale or performance threshold necessary to meet market demand, a senior Commerce Department official told lawmakers Tuesday. &quot;Neither the performance nor yields may match the market of the device,&quot; Thea Kendler, assistant secretary for export administration, said during testimony before a House Foreign Affairs Committee oversight panel. 

&quot;Moreover, the semiconductor chip that is inside that phone is a poorer performance than what they had years ago,&quot; Kendler said. &quot;So our export controls are meaningful in slowing China&#x27;s advanced technology acquisition....&quot; 

The [U.S. Commerce Department&#x27;s Bureau of Industry and Security] is under pressure from Republicans to be tougher on Huawei and its chipmaking partner Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp [or SMIC]. Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul and others have called for the Bureau of Industry and Security to fully cut off both firms from their American suppliers. U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told Bloomberg News in a Monday interview that the U.S. will take the &quot;strongest possible&quot; action to protect its national security following the breakthrough, while declining to confirm the existence of an investigation into Huawei or SMIC.

Bloomberg reports that it was &quot;so that the company no longer has access to users&#x27; individual location histories, cutting off its ability to respond to law enforcement warrants that ask for data on everyone who was in the vicinity of a crime.&quot;
The company said Thursday that for users who have it enabled, location data will soon be saved directly on users&#x27; devices, blocking Google from being able to see it, and, by extension, blocking law enforcement from being able to demand that information from Google. &quot;Your location information is personal,&quot; said Marlo McGriff, director of product for Google Maps, in the blog post. &quot;We&#x27;re committed to keeping it safe, private and in you…</span>

The mission&#x27;s top scientist, Dante Lauretta... showed slides with a long list of intriguing molecules, including carbon-based organics, in the grains and pebbles retrieved from Bennu.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this report from the Verge:

 	On Friday, two days after Threads finally started publicly testing ActivityPub integration, Instagram head Adam Mosseri shared a thread on Threads detailing the company&#x27;s plans for its continued integration with the fediverse. Right now, it&#x27;s possible to follow a few Threads accounts (including Mosseri&#x27;s) from other platforms, but Meta has much bigger plans for Threads interoperability that Mosseri says will take &quot;the better part of a year&quot; to realize... 

Mosseri says that the Threads team wants to make it so the option to follow a Threads account on other platforms is available to &quot;all public accounts on Threads, not just a handful of testers.&quot; The Threads team wants to let replies from other platforms show up inside of Threads. 
According to the article, Threads is also planning to support the ability to follow non-Threads fediverse accounts — and even taking that openness in the other direction. 
&quot;Eventually, it should also be possible to enable creators to leave Threads and take their followers with them to another app / server,&quot; Mosseri writes. 

Flipboard and Wordpress already allow ActivityPub integration, according to NBC News. They estimate there&#x27;s 11 million users of the Fediverse now, &quot;the vast majority of them on Mastodon.&quot;

                              <span>&quot;Unlike automobiles, jumbo jets cannot run on batteries,&quot; notes the Washington Post. 

So Friday the White unveiled a plan for &quot;subsidizing sustainable aviation fuels&quot; — which could also give the U.S. a leg up in a brand new industry:

Senior White House officials said the program would make the airline industry cleaner while bringing prosperity to rural America. But environmental groups and some scientists expressed reservations about the plan, which would award subsidies based on a scientific model that has previously been used to justify incentives for corn-based ethanol. Studies have found the gasoline additive is exacerbating climate change. 

The new tax credits, created through President Biden&#x27;s signature climate law, are meant to spur production of jet fuels that create no more than half the emissions of the petroleum-based product. Each gallon of such fuel qualifies for a tax credit up to $1.75 per gallon. &quot;The concern is they will end up subsidizing fuels that take an enormous amount of land to produce,&quot; said Tim Searchinger, a senior research scholar at Princeton University... Administration officials said on a call with reporters Thursday that they are carefully weighing such concerns. Agencies are in the process of updating the scientific model for gauging climate friendliness of jet fuels, they said, and it will be revised to factor in the emissions impact of cropland converted from food to fuel production. Federal agencies plan to complete their revisions by March 1. 

&quot;The sustainable aviation fuel industry is a potential 36 billion gallon industry that for all intents and purposes is just getting started,&quot; Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said on the call. &quot;This is a big, big deal.&quot;

                              <span>Long-time Slashdot reader destinyland writes: It&#x27;s a question that comes up all the time on Reddit. Etsy even created a special page for programmer-themed gift suggestions (showing more than 5,000 results). While CNET sticks to broader lists of &quot;tech gifts&quot; — and a separate list for &quot;Star Wars gifts&quot; — other sites around the web have been specifically honing in on programmer-specific suggestions. (Blue light-blocking glasses... A giant rubber duck... The world&#x27;s strongest coffee... A printer that transfers digital images onto cheese...) 
So while in years past Amazon has said they laughed at customer reviews for cans of uranium, this year Amazon has now added a special section that&#x27;s entirely dedicated to Gifts for Computer Programmers, according to this funny rundown of 2023&#x27;s &quot;Gifts for Programmers&quot; (that ends up recommending ChatGPT gift cards and backyard office sheds): 

From the article:

[Amazon&#x27;s Gifts for Programmers section] shows over 3,000 results, with geek-friendly subcategories like &quot;Glassware &amp; Drinkware&quot; and &quot;Novelty Clothing&quot;... For the coder in your life, Amazon offers everything from brain–teasing programming puzzles to computer–themed jigsaw puzzles. Of course, there&#x27;s also a wide selection of obligatory funny t–shirts... But this year there&#x27;s also tech-themed ties and motherboard-patterned socks... 


Some programmers, though, might prefer a gift that&#x27;s both fun and educational. And what&#x27;s more entertaining than using your Python skills to program a toy robot dog...? But if you&#x27;re shopping for someone who&#x27;s more of a cat person, Petoi sells a kit for building a programmable (and open source) cat robot named &quot;Nybble&quot;. The sophisticated Arduino-powered feline can be programmed with Python and C++ (as well as block-based coding)... [part of] the new community that&#x27;s building around &quot;OpenCat&quot;, the company&#x27;s own quadruped robotic pet framework (open sourced on GitHub).

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from : Microsoft Research, the blue sky division of the software giant, [...] announced the release of its Phi-2 small language model (SML), a text-to-text AI program that is &quot;small enough to run on a laptop or mobile device,&quot; according to a post on X. At the same time, Phi-2 with its 2.7 billion parameters (connections between artificial neurons) boasts performance that is comparable to other, much larger models including Meta&#x27;s Llama 2-7B with its 7 billion parameters and even Mistral-7B, another 7 billion parameter model.
 
Microsoft researchers also noted in their blog post on the Phi-2 release that it outperforms Google&#x27;s brand new Gemini Nano 2 model despite it having half a billion more parameters, and delivers less &quot;toxicity&quot; and bias in its responses than Llama 2. Microsoft also couldn&#x27;t resist taking a little dig at Google&#x27;s now much-criticized, staged demo video for Gemini in which it showed off how its forthcoming largest and most powerful new AI model, Gemini Ultra, was able to solve fairly complex physics problems and even correct students&#x27; mistakes on them. As it turned out, even though it is likely a fraction of the size of Gemini Ultra, Phi-2 also was able to correctly answer the question and correct the student using the same prompts.
 
However, despite these encouraging findings, there is a big limitation with Phi-2, at least for the time being: it is licensed only for &quot;research purposes only,&quot; not commercial usage, under a custom Microsoft Research License, which further states Phi-2 may only be used for &quot;non-commercial, non-revenue generating, research purposes.&quot; So, businesses looking to build products atop it are out of luck.

                              <span>Solana Saga smartphones sales are surging after arbitrage traders realized every phone comes with an airdrop of BONK meme coins valued at more than the cost of the hardware. &quot;Saga sales have &gt;10x&#x27;d in the past 48 hours, and are now on track to sell out before the new year,&quot; said Solana co-founder Raj Gokal in a post on X. As a result, Gokal&#x27;s counterpart, Anatoly Yakovenko, said they&#x27;ll need to raise the price. CoinDesk reports: The euphoria around BONK -- Solana&#x27;s dog-themed equivalent to Dogecoin -- has led to a turnaround story for Saga, which just one week ago faced dimming prospects amid forgettable sales figures. Saga is a blockchain-enabled smartphone with special features for storing one&#x27;s crypto securely on the phone&#x27;s own hardware. The Saga Discord server exploded on Thursday with newcomers declaring they just bought the phone and wanted to get the airdrop.
 
According to posts on the Discord server, the BONK airdrop is available to those who download the BONK app from Saga&#x27;s crypto-forward custom app store.
&quot;When you physically have the phone you will be able to mint &#x27;Genesis token&#x27; through the &#x27;dApp store, [this] token is eligible to claim the bonk drop,&quot; said a user who identified themselves as an employee of Solana Mobile in the Discord server. &quot;The bonk drop is NOT forever, at some point that promotion will end,&quot; the user, whose screen name was Jax, said in the Discord. &quot;As of right now the claim is live and is up to the bonk team on when they&#x27;d want to close it. No end date yet.&quot;

                              <span>Researchers from the City University of Hong Kong have developed a special antenna that can control all five important aspects of electromagnetic waves using computer software. Interesting Engineering reports: The antenna, which they have named &#x27;microwave universal metasurface antenna,&#x27; is capable of dynamically, simultaneously, independently, and precisely manipulating all the essential properties of electromagnetic waves through software control. [...] The antenna adjusts how strong the waves are, their timing, frequency, direction, and even the way they vibrate, all at the same time. It&#x27;s the first time anyone has made an antenna that can do all these things simultaneously, marking a significant breakthrough in this field.
 
The antenna is special because it can be used in advanced information systems, like the ones we might have in the future. It&#x27;s great for handling a lot of data and keeping that data very safe. It can also transfer power wirelessly, meaning it can charge devices without physical connections. One cool thing about this antenna is that it can control the direction of its signals, adding an extra layer of privacy and security. This makes it a good choice for communication systems where we want to ensure nobody can eavesdrop or secretly listen in on our conversations.
 
Although demonstrated in the microwave band, the UMA&#x27;s concept can be expanded to terahertz frequencies using specific technologies, enabling applications in augmented reality, holography, integrated sensing and communications for 6G, quantum optics, and quantum information science, noted the researchers in their study. The study has been published in the journal Nature Communications.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Phys.Org: A NASA telescope has captured the biggest solar flare in years, which temporarily knocked out radio communication on Earth. The sun spit out the huge flare on Thursday, resulting in two hours of radio interference in parts of the U.S. and other sunlit parts of the world. Scientists said it was the biggest flare since 2017. Multiple pilots reported communication disruptions, with the impact felt across the country, said the government&#x27;s Space Weather Prediction Center.
 
Scientists are now monitoring this sunspot region and analyzing for a possible outburst of plasma from the sun, also known as a coronal mass ejection, directed at Earth. The eruption occurred in the far northwest section of the sun, according to the center. NASA&#x27;s Solar Dynamics Observatory caught the action in extreme ultraviolet light, recording the powerful surge of energy as a huge, bright flash. Launched in 2010, the spacecraft is in an extremely high orbit around Earth, where it constantly monitors the sun. The sun is nearing the peak of its 11-year or so solar cycle. Maximum sunspot activity is predicted for 2025.

                              <span>Alex Williams reports via The New York Times: Vera Molnar, a Hungarian-born artist who has been called the godmother of generative art for her pioneering digital work, which started with the hulking computers of the 1960s and evolved through the current age of NFTs, died on Dec. 7 in Paris. She was 99. Her death was announced on social media by the Pompidou Center in Paris, which is scheduled to present a major exhibition of her work in February. Ms. Molnar had lived in Paris since 1947. While her computer-aided paintings and drawings, which drew inspiration from geometric works by Piet Mondrian and Paul Klee, were eventually exhibited in major museums like the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, her work was not always embraced early in her career.

                              <span>Firefox&#x27;s Android browser now has over 450 new extensions available on Mozilla&#x27;s Firefox Browser Add-ons page. &quot;These extensions allow users to customize the mobile browser to their needs, whether that involves adding anti-tracking privacy tools, content blockers, productivity tools or other features that introduce new experiences, like streaming music, or those that allow users to personalize the browser&#x27;s user interface -- like switching all websites to a dark mode or offering a better way to manage tabs,&quot; reports TechCrunch. From the report: The lack of extensions has been an issue for Firefox for Android users for years following the 2020 launch of a rebuilt version of the mobile browser that replaced the app&#x27;s previous codebase with &quot;GeckoView,&quot; a new, faster and more customizable browser engine. At the time, the company said it made a decision to limit the supported extensions to only those within the &quot;Recommended Extensions&quot; program -- meaning those that were commonly installed by end users. This choice allowed Mozilla to quickly get the new browser into consumers&#x27; hands, but squashed the long tail of extension development -- and opportunity for software developers focused on this market.
 
While Firefox&#x27;s nightly builds later enabled more extensions, the publicly available Firefox for Android browser did not have access to these hundreds of extensions, meaning most of Firefox&#x27;s mainstream users were also without. In August of this year, Mozilla said it had finally completed the infrastructure needed to bring the open extension ecosystem back to Firefox for Android. It then began to test and make hundreds more extensions available to Firefox for Android users, culminating in today&#x27;s news that there are now 450+ extensions available.

                              <span>TikTok&#x27;s parent company, ByteDance, has been secretly using OpenAI&#x27;s technology to develop its own competing large language model (LLM). &quot;This practice is generally considered a faux pas in the AI world,&quot; writes The Verge&#x27;s Alex Heath. &quot;It&#x27;s also in direct violation of OpenAI&#x27;s terms of service, which state that its model output can&#x27;t be used &#x27;to develop any artificial intelligence models that compete with our products and services.&#x27;&quot; From the report: Nevertheless, internal ByteDance documents shared with me confirm that the OpenAI API has been relied on to develop its foundational LLM, codenamed Project Seed, during nearly every phase of development, including for training and evaluating the model.
Employees involved are well aware of the implications; I&#x27;ve seen conversations on Lark, ByteDance&#x27;s internal communication platform for employees, about how to &quot;whitewash&quot; the evidence through &quot;data desensitization.&quot; The misuse is so rampant that Project Seed employees regularly hit their max allowance for API access. Most of the company&#x27;s GPT usage has been done through Microsoft&#x27;s Azure program, which has the same policy as OpenAI.
 
In response, OpenAI said that it has suspended ByteDance&#x27;s account: &quot;All API customers must adhere to our usage policies to ensure that our technology is used for good. While ByteDance&#x27;s use of our API was minimal, we have suspended their account while we further investigate. If we discover that their usage doesn&#x27;t follow these policies, we will ask them to make necessary changes or terminate their account.&quot;

Until then, Kytch had been selling McDonald&#x27;s restaurant owners a popular internet-connected gadget designed to attach to their notoriously fragile and often broken soft-serve McFlurry dispensers, manufactured by McDonalds equipment partner Taylor. The Kytch device would essentially hack into the ice cream machine&#x27;s internals, monitor its operations, and send diagnostic data over the internet to an owner or manager to help keep it runn…</span>

                              <span>Delta Dental of California announced that they&#x27;ve suffered a data breach that exposed the personal data of almost seven million patients. BleepingComputer reports: Delta Dental of California is a dental insurance provider that covers 45 million people across 15 states and is part of the Delta Dental Plans Association. According to a Delta Dental of California data breach notification (PDF), the company suffered unauthorized access by threat actors through the MOVEit file transfer software application.
 
The software was vulnerable to a zero-day SQL injection flaw leading to remote code execution, tracked as CVE-2023-34362, which the Clop ransomware gang leveraged to breach thousands of organizations worldwide. Delta Dental of California learned about the compromise on June 1, 2023, and five days later, following an internal investigation, it confirmed that unauthorized actors had accessed and stolen data from its systems between May 27 and May 30, 2023. The second, more lengthy investigation to determine the exact impact of the security incident was completed on November 27, 2023.
 
Based on this, the data breach has so far impacted 6,928,932 customers of Delta Dental of California, who had their names, financial account numbers, and credit/debit card numbers, including security codes, exposed. Delta Dental of California provides 24 months of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services to impacted patients to mitigate the risk of their exposed data. Details on enrolling in the program are enclosed in the personal notices.

                              <span>Malak Saleh reports via Engadget: Twitch has quickly taken back its policy update that permitted users to post sexual content as long as it was labeled. In another update, the company said it is not going to allow any depictions of real or fictional nudity on its streaming platform. After giving users the green light to post &quot;artistic nudity,&quot; Twitch says some streamers created content that violated policy.
 
The media streamed in response to the initial approval of sexually explicit content on Twitch was &quot;met with community concern,&quot; according to the update. The company said, &quot;We have decided that we went too far with this change.&quot; While a huge part of the initial decision was to allow for the &quot;digital depiction&quot; of artistic nudity, the company clarified that digital depictions of sexual content is a concern when artificial intelligence can be used to develop realistic images and that it can be difficult to discern between what&#x27;s been digitally produced and real photography.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Some TikTok users may have skipped reviewing an update to TikTok&#x27;s terms of service this summer that shakes up the process for filing a legal dispute against the app. According to The New York Times, changes that TikTok &quot;quietly&quot; made to its terms suggest that the popular app has spent the back half of 2023 preparing for a wave of legal battles. In July, TikTok overhauled its rules for dispute resolution, pivoting from requiring private arbitration to insisting that legal complaints be filed in either the US District Court for the Central District of California or the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles. Legal experts told the Times this could be a way for TikTok to dodge arbitration claims filed en masse that can cost companies millions more in fees than they expected to pay through individual arbitration.
 
Perhaps most significantly, TikTok also added a section to its terms that mandates that all legal complaints be filed within one year of any alleged harm caused by using the app. The terms now say that TikTok users &quot;forever waive&quot; rights to pursue any older claims. And unlike a prior version of TikTok&#x27;s terms of service archived in May 2023, users do not seem to have any options to opt out of waiving their rights. Lawyers told the Times that these changes could make it more challenging for TikTok users to pursue legal action at a time when federal agencies are heavily scrutinizing the app and complaints about certain TikTok features allegedly harming kids are mounting.

                              <span>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday denied a petition by the country&#x27;s largest crypto exchange, Coinbase Global, seeking new rules from the agency for the digital asset sector. From a report: The five-member body, in a 3-2 vote, said it would not propose new rules because it fundamentally disagreed that current regulations are &quot;unworkable&quot; for the crypto sphere, as Coinbase has argued. The letter marked the latest in a broader tug-of-war between the crypto sector and the top U.S. markets regulator, which has repeatedly said most crypto tokens are securities and subject to its jurisdiction. 

The agency has sued several crypto companies, including Coinbase, for listing and trading crypto tokens which it says should be registered as securities. &quot;Existing laws and regulations apply to the crypto securities markets,&quot; SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a separate statement supporting the decision. In 2022, the company pressed the SEC to create a bespoke set of rules for the crypto sector, arguing that existing U.S. securities laws are inadequate. In April, Coinbase appealed to a judge to force the SEC to respond to the petition.

                              <span>A marketing team within media giant Cox Media Group (CMG) claims it has the capability to listen to ambient conversations of consumers through embedded microphones in smartphones, smart TVs, and other devices to gather data and use it to target ads, according to a review of CMG marketing materials by 404 Media and details from a pitch given to an outside marketing professional. From a report: Called &quot;Active Listening,&quot; CMG claims the capability can identify potential customers &quot;based on casual conversations in real time.&quot; The news signals that what a huge swath of the public has believed for years -- that smartphones are listening to people in order to deliver ads -- may finally be a reality in certain situations. Until now, there was no evidence that such a capability actually existed, but its myth permeated due to how sophisticated other ad tracking methods have become. 

It is not immediately clear if the capability CMG is advertising and claims works is being used on devices in the market today, but the company notes it is &quot;a marketing technique fit for the future. Available today.&quot; 404 Media also found a representative of the company on LinkedIn explicitly asking interested parties to contact them about the product. One marketing professional pitched by CMG on the tech said a CMG representative explained the prices of the service to them. &quot;What would it mean for your business if you could target potential clients who are actively discussing their need for your services in their day-to-day conversations? No, it&#x27;s not a Black Mirror episode -- it&#x27;s Voice Data, and CMG has the capabilities to use it to your business advantage,&quot; CMG&#x27;s website reads.

                              <span>China on Friday proposed a four-tier classification to help it respond to data security incidents, highlighting Beijing&#x27;s concern with large-scale data leaks and hacking within its borders. From a report: The plan, which is currently soliciting opinions from the public, proposes a four-tier, colour-coded system depending on the degree of harm inflicted upon national security, a company&#x27;s online and information network, or the running of the economy. 

According to the plan, incidents that involve losses surpassing 1 billion yuan ($141 million) and affect the personal information of over 100 million people, or the &quot;sensitive&quot; information of over 10 million people, will be classed as &quot;especially grave,&quot; to which a red warning must be issued. The plan demands that in response to red and orange warnings, the involved companies and relevant local regulatory authorities must establish a 24-hour work rota to address the incident and MIIT must be notified of the data breach within ten minutes of the incident happening, among other measures.

                              <span>Government researchers in the U.S. are studying methods to help identify hackers based on the code they use to carry out cyberattacks. From a report: The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, the lead federal research agency for the intelligence community, plans to develop technologies that could speed up investigations for identifying perpetrators of cyberattacks. &quot;The number of attacks is increasing far more than the number of forensic experts that are available to go after these attacks,&quot; said Kristopher Reese, who is managing the research program at IARPA and holds a doctorate in computer science and engineering. The lack of forensic resources means hackers who target small organizations or companies that don&#x27;t fall under critical infrastructure sectors often escape identification, he said. 

Tools that are developed as part of the planned 30-month research project won&#x27;t replace human analysts, who are crucial for identifying social and political dynamics that might explain why a particular hacking group targeted a victim, Reese said. But using artificial intelligence to analyze code used in cyberattacks will make investigations more efficient, he said. IARPA is accepting pitches from researchers until next month and plans to begin research next summer. [...] There hasn&#x27;t been enough research into how analyzing code can reveal a hacker&#x27;s identity, Reese said. Behavioral traits evident in code can reveal specific countries where hackers might be from or even the university where they were trained, he said. Some companies also have style guides outlining how employees should program, which could leave traces that indicate a person worked there, he said.

In a moment many close observers thought might never come, at least one version of the quintessential piece of intellectual property and perhaps the most iconic character in American pop culture will be free from Disney&#x27;s copyright as his first screen release, the 1928 short &quot;Steamboat Willie,&quot; featuring both Mickey and Minnie Mouse, becomes available for public use. &quot;This is it. This is Mickey Mouse. This is exciting because it&#x27;s kind of symbolic,&quot; said Jennifer Jenkins, a professor of law and director of Duke&#x27;s Center for the Study of Public Domain, who writes an annual Jan. 1 column for &quot;Public Domain Day.&quot; &quot;I kind of feel like the pipe on the steamboat, like expelling smoke. It&#x27;s so exciting.&quot; U.S. law allows a copyright to be held for 95 years after Congress expanded it several times during Mickey&#x27;s life.

                              <span>Ten years ago, a Dutch scientist unveiled a $330,000 lab-grown hamburger made from cow cells grown in petri dishes. It took six weeks to culture the patty. A chef cooked it onstage as journalists watched. Reactions ranged from &quot;unpleasant&quot; to &quot;beeflike.&quot; The scientist expected supermarket sales in a decade. His company and others have since raised over $2 billion but have little to show, only recently making one pound of chicken monthly. Despite bold promises of mass production, low emissions, and better nutrition, commercial viability remains elusive. Bloomberg Business: The company [Upside Foods], in a letter from its attorney to Bloomberg Businessweek, says plans for scaling up have been an evolution saddled with &quot;realities and complexities of doing something that has never been done before. Innovation rarely happens in a straight and continuous line.&quot; 

The dream is moist, meaty flesh self-multiplying ad infinitum in high-tech, stainless steel cell-growing chambers. But according to internal company documentation and eight former employees, most of whom requested anonymity because they don&#x27;t have permission to discuss confidential information, Upside at the moment is actually growing just minuscule numbers of chicken skin-type cells in small plastic bottles, then scraping them out gram by gram to compress and mold them into a single forkful of flesh. This labor-intensive chicken has higher levels of cholesterol and lead than the real thing, publicly available company documentation shows. Even if that sounds remotely desirable, some scientists say the whole energy-intensive endeavor may actually be worse for the environment, especially with chicken, which has the smallest carbon footprint of anything at the local butcher. All of which points to this question: Why exactly are we chasing lab-grown chicken?[...]

                              <span>Sony Group&#x27;s Naughty Dog studio has cancelled an online version of its popular console game The Last of Us. From a report: Naughty Dog announced today that the multiplayer spin-off of the hit series is no longer in development, citing concerns about managing ongoing content for a live-service game while still trying to produce the single-player blockbusters the PlayStation studio is famous for. &quot;We realize many of you have been anticipating news around the project that we&#x27;ve been calling The Last of Us Online,&quot; Naughty Dog wrote in an update. 

&quot;There&#x27;s no easy way to say this: We&#x27;ve made the incredibly difficult decision to stop development on that game.&quot; The studio said that as production on the project ramped up, it became clear that &quot;we&#x27;d have to put all our studio resources behind supporting post launch content for years to come, severely impacting development on future single-player games.&quot; The choices were apparently between becoming a &quot;solely live-service games studio&quot; in the mold of modern day Bungie, which makes Destiny 2, or &quot;continue to focus on single-player narrative games that have defined Naughty Dog&#x27;s heritage.&quot;

                              <span>In a cavernous theater lit up with the green shapes of camels and palms at COP28 in Dubai, ecologist Thomas Crowther, former chief scientific adviser for the United Nations&#x27; Trillion Trees Campaign, was doing something he never would have expected a few years ago: begging environmental ministers to stop planting so many trees. From a report: Mass plantations are not the environmental solution they&#x27;re purported to be, Crowther argued when he took the floor on December 9 for one of the summit&#x27;s &quot;Nature Day&quot; events. The potential of newly created forests to draw down carbon is often overstated. They can be harmful to biodiversity. Above all, they are really damaging when used, as they often are, as avoidance offsets-- &quot;as an excuse to avoid cutting emissions,&quot; Crowther said.

                              <span>Apple will expand its use of advanced OLED screens to iPads and MacBooks and is considering eventually introducing foldable tablets, a move set to further shake up the $150 billion display industry as it shifts away from traditional LCD screens, Asian news outlet Nikkei reported Friday. From the report: OLED, or organic light-emitting diode, displays are already used in most premium smartphones, including iPhones. Apple plans to deploy the tech in its high-end iPads next year, multiple tech industry executives told Nikkei Asia. An OLED MacBook model is also under development for production in the second half of 2025 at the earliest, the people said. The growing penetration of OLED is a significant win for Samsung Display and LG Display of South Korea and China&#x27;s BOE Technology Holding, which have all bet heavily on this expensive display technology. 

On the flip side, it could be a blow to display makers that do not have much presence in this segment, including JDI and Sharp of Japan, and AUO and Innolux of Taiwan. Apple has also started evaluating the possibility of making foldable iPads after it deploys the flexible OLED screens on the tablet, but it does not have a concrete timeline for doing so, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The iPhone maker is not the first company to adopt OLED displays for tablets. Huawei, for instance, has been a significant driver of this trend, which in turn has helped strengthen the Chinese display supply chain.

                              <span>In an interview with Lex Fridman, Jeff Bezos candidly acknowledged Blue Origin&#x27;s slow progress (compared to SpaceX). From a report: &quot;Blue Origin needs to be much faster, and it&#x27;s one of the reasons that I left my role as the CEO of Amazon a couple of years ago,&quot; he said. &quot;I wanted to come in, and Blue Origin needs me right now. Adding some energy, some sense of urgency. We need to move much faster. And we&#x27;re going to.&quot; 

How is Blue Origin going to speed up? 

&quot;We&#x27;re going to become the world&#x27;s most decisive company across any industry,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#x27;re going to get really good at taking appropriate technology risks, making those decisions quickly. You know, being bold on those things. And having the right culture that supports that. You need people to be ambitious, technically ambitious. If there are five ways to do something, we&#x27;ll study them, but let&#x27;s go through them very quickly and make a decision. We can always change our mind.&quot;

                              <span>Natasha Singer reports via The New York Times: According to new research from Stanford University, the popularization of A.I. chatbots has not boosted overall cheating rates in schools (Warning: source may be paywalled; alternative source). In surveys this year of more than 40 U.S. high schools, some 60 to 70 percent of students said they had recently engaged in cheating -- about the same percent as in previous years, Stanford education researchers said. &quot;There was a panic that these A.I. models will allow a whole new way of doing something that could be construed as cheating,&quot; said Denise Pope, a senior lecturer at Stanford Graduate School of Education who has surveyed high school students for more than a decade through an education nonprofit she co-founded. But &quot;we&#x27;re just not seeing the change in the data.&quot;
 
ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI in San Francisco, began to capture the public imagination late last year with its ability to fabricate human-sounding essays and emails. Almost immediately, classroom technology boosters started promising that A.I. tools like ChatGPT would revolutionize education. And critics began warning that such tools -- which liberally make stuff up -- would enable widespread cheating, and amplify misinformation, in schools. Now the Stanford research, along with a recent report from the Pew Research Center, are challenging the notion that A.I. chatbots are upending public schools.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Google&#x27;s parent company, Alphabet, is launching a new company called &quot;Renew Home.&quot; The new company will pull in some other projects from Nest and the rest of Alphabet to become a supposed one-stop shop for power savings and clean energy usage. The core concept is partnering with power companies to obtain data about the current condition of the power grid and using that data to change consumer habits. The new company is bankrolled by Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners (SIP), an Alphabet venture capital firm.
 
The first existing service getting pulled into Renew Home is Nest Renew. This service for Nest Thermostats uses power company data to tell consumers how their electricity is being generated and what it costs. That data lets your thermostat do things like automatically shift heating and cooling to times of day when energy is cheaper or cleaner, and shows various reports about the cleanness of the energy you&#x27;ve been using. (Nest&#x27;s feature that lets utility companies remotely take control of your thermostat, Rush Hour Rewards, does not seem to be part of Renew Home.)
 
Another Alphabet service being pulled into Renew Home is OhmConnect, which is the same basic idea as Nest&#x27;s grid data-power thermostat adjustments but for more than just your thermostat. OhmConnect is compatible with a very small list of smart devices, like Nest-rival Ecobee and Honeywell thermostats, TL-Link&#x27;s &quot;Kasa&quot; smart home system, and Tesla vehicles. The backbone of the service appears to be the in-house &quot;OhmPlug&quot; smart outlet, which can monitor the energy usage of anything that plugs into the wall. By seeing that you&#x27;ve turned these smart devices during peak usage times, OhmConnect offers people rewards like gift cards or cash for not using power when the grid is at capacity.

                              <span>The year 2024 is soon to be upon us, and as long-time Rust aficionados know,
that means that a new Edition of Rust is on the horizon!
What is an Edition?
You may be aware that a new version of Rust is released every six weeks.
New versions of the language can both add things as well as change things,
but only in backwards-compatible ways, according to Rust&#x27;s
1.0 stability guarantee.
But does that mean that Rust can never make backwards-incompatible changes?
Not quite! This is what an Edition is:
Rust&#x27;s mechanism for introducing backwards-incompatible changes in a backwards-compatible way.
If that sounds like a contradiction,
there are three key properties of Editions that preserve the stability guarantee:
Editions are opt-in;
crates only receive breaking changes if its authors explicitly a…</span>

                              <span>Amrita Khalid reports via The Verge: Proton has released a desktop version of its Proton Mail app that will give users full access to both Proton Mail and Proton Calendar and (eventually) the ability to view your emails offline. The desktop app is available in beta is optimized for both Windows and macOS, and encrypts sent emails end-to-end just like with the browser version, according to the Swiss company, while offline access to emails will be available &quot;soon.&quot; [...] It&#x27;s important to note that you&#x27;ll still need internet access to both send and encrypt your emails on Proton. But the offline feature will let you view and draft emails while traveling, during a power outage, or any other situation where you don&#x27;t have access to the internet.
 
Proton is also bringing encrypted auto-forwarding to paid users, both on its desktop and browser versions, though the encryption for forwards will only apply when the forwarded emails go to other Proton users. The company says it has made improvements to Proton Calendar, too, including a fully searchable web version. Not everyone will be able to access Proton&#x27;s desktop app right away. Proton is restricting access to its paid &quot;Visionary&quot; tier for legacy users at first (though the company is reopening subscriptions to that tier through January 3rd, 2024). The plan is to make the desktop app available to all users in early 2024.

                              <span>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Threads is now available to users in the European Union. &quot;Today we&#x27;re opening Threads to more countries in Europe,&quot; wrote Zuckerberg in a post on the platform. &quot;Welcome everyone.&quot; MacRumors reports: The move comes five months after the social media network launched in most markets around the world, but remained unavailable to EU-based users due to regulatory hurdles. [...] In addition to creating a Threads profile for posting, users in the EU can also simply browse Threads without having an Instagram account, an option likely introduced to comply with legislation surrounding online services.
 
The expansion into a market of 448 million people should see Threads&#x27; user numbers get a decent boost. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on a company earnings call in October that Threads now has &quot;just under&quot; 100 million monthly users. Since its launch earlier this year it has gained a web app, an ability to search for posts, and a post editing feature.

Ledger, a company that makes a widely used and popular crypto hardware and software wallet, among other products, announced on X (previously Twitter) that someone had pushed out a &quot;malicious version&quot; of its Ledger Connect Kit, a library that decentralized apps (dApps) made by other companies and projects use to connect to the Ledger wallet service.
 
&quot;A genuine version is being pushed to replace the malicious file now. Do not interact with any dApps for the moment. We will keep you informed as the situation evolves,&quot; Ledger wrote. Soon after, Ledger posted an update saying that the hackers had…</span>

                              <span>The Federal Communications Commission has taken a step toward prohibiting early termination fees charged by cable and satellite TV providers. From a report: If given final approval, the FCC action would also require cable and satellite providers to provide a prorated credit or rebate to customers who cancel before a billing period ends. The new rules are being floated in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that the FCC voted to approve this week in a 3-2 vote, with both Republicans dissenting. The NPRM seeks public comment on the proposed rules and could lead to a final vote in a few months or so. 

&quot;Today&#x27;s action proposes to adopt customer service protections that prohibit cable operators and DBS (Direct Broadcast Satellite) providers from imposing a fee for the early termination of a cable or DBS video service contract,&quot; the FCC said. &quot;Additionally, the NPRM recommends the adoption of customer service protections to require cable and DBS providers to grant subscribers a prorated credit or rebate for the remaining whole days in a monthly or periodic billing cycle after the subscriber cancels service.&quot; 

FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said, &quot;Consumers are tired of these junk fees. They now have more choices when it comes to video content. But these friction-filled tactics to keep us subscribing to our current providers are aggravating and unfair. So today we kick off a rulemaking to put an end to these practices.&quot; Cable lobby group NCTA-The Internet &amp; Television Association opposes the plan and said it will submit comments to support &quot;consumer choice and competitive parity.&quot;

                              <span>Amazon, which launched its first internet satellites in October, says it will use space lasers to ensure reliable broadband coverage even in the middle of the ocean. From a report: The technology will enable a satellite to deliver data to a cruise ship, say, even if the spacecraft isn&#x27;t in range of an Amazon ground station connected to the internet. Instead, the laser will pass the request on to another satellite that has a clear view of a ground station. 

The two prototype satellites successfully tested the technology, which is officially called optical inter-satellite links, Amazon said on Thursday. &quot;If you&#x27;re going to serve maritime customers, air customers, you have got to be able to get data up to your satellites,&quot; said Rajeev Badyal, who leads Amazon&#x27;s Project Kuiper internet-from-space initiative. &quot;And in the middle of the ocean, it&#x27;s difficult if not impossible&quot; to install ground stations.

                              <span>Google is about to launch its grand plan to block third-party cookies in Chrome that many websites use to track your activity across the web for profit. From a report: Starting on January 4th, Google will start testing its new Tracking Protection feature that will eventually restrict website access to third-party cookies by default. It will come to a very small subset of Chrome users at the start, specifically to one percent of users globally. Afterward, Google plans to phase out the use of third-party cookies for all users in the second half of 2024. 

If you&#x27;re randomly selected to try Tracking Protection, Google will notify you when opening Chrome on desktop or Android. If there are issues detected by Chrome while you&#x27;re browsing, a prompt will appear asking if you&#x27;d like to temporarily re-enable third-party cookies for the site.

                              <span>Intel unveiled new computer chips on Thursday, including Gaudi3, an AI chip for generative AI software. Gaudi3 will launch next year and will compete with rival chips from Nvidia and AMD that power big and power-hungry AI models. From a report: The most prominent AI models, like OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT, run on Nvidia GPUs in the cloud. It&#x27;s one reason Nvidia stock has been up nearly 230% year-to-date while Intel shares are up 68%. And it&#x27;s why companies like AMD and, now Intel, have announced chips that they hope will attract AI companies away from Nvidia&#x27;s dominant position in the market. 

While the company was light on details, Gaudi3 will compete with Nvidia&#x27;s H100, the main choice among companies that build huge farms of the chips to power AI applications, and AMD&#x27;s forthcoming MI300X, when it starts shipping to customers in 2024. Intel has been building Gaudi chips since 2019, when it bought a chip developer called Habana Labs.

                              <span>General Motors&#x27; Cruise robotaxi unit announced today that it will lay off 900 employees, or 24% of its workforce. The news follows the departure of nine executives amid an ongoing safety investigation following an inccident in which a pedestrian was dragged by one of the company&#x27;s self-driving cars. CNBC reports: The company had 3,800 employees before Thursday&#x27;s cuts, which also follow a round of contractor layoffs at Cruise last month. Affected employees will receive paychecks until Feb. 12 and at least an additional eight weeks of pay, plus severance based on tenure. A Cruise representative also told CNBC that the company&#x27;s goal is now to work on a fully driverless L4 service, as well as relaunching ride-hailing in one city to start. In a statement, a Cruise spokesperson said, &quot;We shared the difficult news that we are reducing our workforce, primarily in commercial operations and related corporate functions. These changes reflect our decision to focus on more deliberate commercialization plans with safety as our north star. We are supporting impacted Cruisers with strong severance and benefits packages and are grateful to the departing employees who played important roles in building Cruise and supporting our mission.&quot;
 
GM added, &quot;GM supports the difficult employment decisions made by Cruise as it reflects their more deliberate path forward, with safety as the north star. We are confident in the team and committed to supporting Cruise as they set the company up for long-term success with a focus on trust, accountability and transparency.&quot;

                              <span>Adobe said US regulators are probing the company&#x27;s cancellation rules for software subscriptions, an issue that has long been a source of ire for customers. From a report: The company has been cooperating with the Federal Trade Commission on a civil investigation of the issue since June 2022, Adobe said Wednesday in a filing. A settlement could involve &quot;significant monetary costs or penalties,&quot; the company said. 

Users of Adobe programs including Photoshop and Premiere have long complained about the expense of canceling a subscription, which can cost more than $700 annually for individuals. Subscribers must cancel within two weeks of buying a subscription to receive a full refund; otherwise, they incur a prorated penalty. Some other digital services such as Spotify and Netflix don&#x27;t charge a cancellation fee. Digital subscriptions have been a recent focus for the FTC. It proposed a rule in March that consumers must be able to cancel subscriptions as easily as they sign up for them. 

&quot;Too often, companies make it difficult to unsubscribe from a service, wasting Americans&#x27; time and money on things they may not want or need,&quot; President Joe Biden said in a social media post at the time. Adobe said the FTC alerted the company in November that commission staff say &quot;they had the authority to enter into consent negotiations to determine if a settlement regarding their investigation of these issues could be reached. We believe our practices comply with the law and are currently engaging in discussion with FTC staff.&quot;

                              <span>The Economist reports: &quot;Shake, shake, shake, shake,&quot; Taylor Swift sings from the stage of Lumen Field in Seattle at 10.35 in the evening on July 22nd. The fans respond, enthusiastically; the stadium duly shakes; a nearby seismometer takes note. To pop aficionados &quot;Shake it off&quot; is an empowering up-tempo anthem played at 160 beats per minute. To the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network, which is designed to monitor earthquakes, it is a 2.6 hertz signal in which the amplitude of the acceleration was as large as one centimetre per second, per second. 

The well-situated seismometer first came to public attention in January 2011, when it recorded the response of fans of the Seattle Seahawks, an American football team, to a magnificent touchdown by Marshawn Lynch, a running back known as &quot;Beast Mode.&quot; The &quot;Beast Quake&quot; went down in local sporting history. When Ms Swift came to town for two nights of her Eras tour, Jacqueline Caplan-Auerbach, a geology professor at Western Washington University, used the opportunity to learn more about how events in the stadium shake its surroundings. On December 11th she presented some of her conclusions at the American Geophysical Union&#x27;s autumn meeting in San Francisco. 

[...] Dr Caplan-Auerbach wanted to see whether such resonant amplification might also be at play elsewhere, and to distinguish between the effect of the music itself and the audience&#x27;s response. Her concert-night data showed two distinct sets of signals, one in higher frequencies (30-80hz), one in lower frequencies (1-8hz). The higher-frequency signals were present during the sound check, when the band were on stage but the stadium empty, and absent during the concerts&#x27; &quot;surprise songs,&quot; played without the band by Ms Swift alone. The lower frequencies were absent when the audience had yet to arrive. Clearly those higher frequencies were from the music itself.

Pixie will use the information on a customer&#x27;s phone -- including data from Google products like Maps and Gmail -- to evolve into a far more personalized version of the Google Assistant, according to one of the people with knowledge of the project. The feature could launch as soon as next year with the Pixel 9 and the 9 Pro, this person said.

                              <span>Pope Francis has called for a legally binding international treaty to regulate AI, saying algorithms must not be allowed to replace human values and warning of a &quot;technological dictatorship&quot; threatening human existence. From a report: The pope made his call on Thursday in a message for the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s World Day of Peace, which is celebrated on Jan. 1. The title of the message, which is traditionally sent to world leaders and heads of institutions such as the United Nations, is &quot;Artificial Intelligence and Peace.&quot; 

[...] &quot;The global scale of artificial intelligence makes it clear that, alongside the responsibility of sovereign states to regulate its use internally, international organizations can play a decisive role in reaching multilateral agreements and coordinating their application and enforcement,&quot; Francis wrote in the message. &quot;I urge the global community of nations to work together in order to adopt a binding international treaty that regulates the development and use of artificial intelligence in its many forms,&quot; the pope said.

                              <span>According to Reuters, General Motors&#x27; Cruise robotaxi unit dismissed nine executives amid an ongoing safety investigation, which the company confirmed included Chief Operating Officer Gil West. The company conducted a full safety review following an incident in San Francisco where a pedestrian was struck and dragged by one of its cars. GM already halted service nationwide and removed its cars from public roads. Reuters reports: CEO Kyle Vogt and co-founder Dan Kan both resigned in recent weeks and Cruise is preparing for a round of layoffs this month. &quot;Following an initial analysis of the October 2 incident and Cruise&#x27;s response to it, nine individuals departed Cruise,&quot; according to the memo. &quot;We are committed to full transparency and are focused on rebuilding trust and operating with the highest standards when it comes to safety, integrity, and accountability,&quot; the memo said. &quot;As a result, we believe that new leadership is necessary to achieve these goals.&quot;
 
The Cruise spokesperson confirmed that among those dismissed was also Chief Legal and Policy Officer Jeff Bleich and Senior Vice President of Government Affairs David Estrada. Cruise&#x27;s troubles are also a setback for an industry dependent on public trust and the cooperation of regulators. The unit had in recent months touted ambitious plans to expand to more cities, offering fully autonomous taxi rides. The investigation, led by law firm Quinn Emmanuel, is expected to last until January, GM has said. &quot;The personnel decisions made today are a necessary step for Cruise to move forward as it focuses on accountability, trust and transparency,&quot; GM said in a statement.

                              <span>I’ve found that you eventually get bored or at least used to every form of material trapping you can buy. Cars, watches, cameras, computers, whatever. It’s not that fancy stuff stops being nice, but it does stop being wow. That’s the essence of the hedonic treadmill. But do you know what never gets old? Nature.
And I mean nature in the broadest possible sense. The evening light. The rustling of the leaves. A pair of eagles circling above your head. A rock that’s been in the same place for thousands of years. The colors of a beautiful sunset or sunrise. Yes, even touching grass with your toes.
If you literally stop to smell the flowers, you’ll never stop being wowed by the awesomeness of this planet. That’s been the most enduring gift of moving back to California. We live in the wilderness here. In Denmark, we lived smack in the middle of Copenhagen. Which is a delight all of its own, but on my ultimate scorecard, a (far) secondary one to nature.
  
      
        

  
This is the sight that greeted me as I stepped into my home office this morning about half an hour before sunrise. I’ve seen a sunrise like this in Malibu a million times before, but it never, ever grows old. I’m still struck by the kind of life-affirming wow that only the spectacle of nature is capable of.
A few years ago, I remember reading about forest bathing. The idea that spending time walking in nature lowered blood pressure and stress significantly more than walking the same distance in a city. I completely believe it.
It’s become a cliche, “touch grass”, but it’s also true. Your life will literally be longer, healthier, and happier, if you let nature wash over you regularly.
That’s one of the reasons why I’m such a fan of remote work. Imagine taking that hour or two of commuting – which, when done in rush hour by car, is perhaps one of the most blood pressure and stress raising activities known to man! – and trading that in for a walk in the forest or the garden or any form of wilderness.
Bliss.</span>

The Verge reports: The beta app is available from the Meta Quest Store, and you&#x27;ll simply need to pair a supported Bluetooth controller to start playing. You can use an Xbox controller (that supports Bluetooth), a PS4 one, or even Nintendo&#x27;s Switch Pro controllers. Support for PS5 controllers is &quot;coming in the future,&quot; according to Meta.

[...] The Commission presented its original plan to reform labor laws to boost protections for platform workers back in December 2021, setting out a presumption of employment for workers in a bid to flip the odds on gig economy exploitation. But the proposal proved contentious, with heavy industry lobbying from tech platforms such as Uber pushing for gig workers to be carved out of Europe&#x27;s employment protections. There were also divisions between Member States over how much worker protection vs platform shielding they were prepared to commit to. But after a final trilogue, …</span>

                              <span>Earlier this year, General Motors announced plans to phase out Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, shifting instead to built-in infotainment systems developed with Google. Now, the company has explained why it made that decision to MotorTrend: Tim Babbitt, GM&#x27;s head of product for infotainment, gave MT a better explanation at a press event for the new Chevrolet Blazer EV, the flagship vehicle in the no CarPlay or Android Auto strategy. According to him, there&#x27;s an important factor that didn&#x27;t make it into the fact sheet: safety. Specifically, he cited driver distraction caused by cell phone usage behind the wheel. According to Babbitt, CarPlay and Android Auto have stability issues that manifest themselves as bad connections, poor rendering, slow responses, and dropped connections. And when Ca…</span>

                              <span>OpenAI has struck a deal with Politico parent company Axel Springer, allowing ChatGPT to summarize news stories from Politico and Business Insider. CNBC reports: Once the OpenAI-Axel Springer deal goes into effect, when a user asks ChatGPT a question, it will respond with summaries of news articles from media outlets such as Politico, Business Insider, Bild and Welt. The chatbot will also include articles that would otherwise be limited to subscribers of those outlets, according to a release, and the answers will include &quot;attribution and links to the full articles for transparency.&quot; The partnership follows a deal that OpenAI struck with the Associated Press in July, allowing it to license the AP&#x27;s news archive for training data.
 
As part of the agreement, Axel Springer will provide content from its media brands as training data for OpenAI&#x27;s large language models, such as GPT-4, the AI model that helps power ChatGPT. The News Media Alliance, a trade group representing more than 2,200 publishers, released research in October suggesting that data sets used to train popular AI models rely &quot;significantly&quot; more on publisher content, outweighing it by a factor ranging from over five to almost 100, compared to generic web content.

Chatbot Arena users can enter any prompt they can think of into the site&#x27;s form to see side-by-side responses from two randomly selected models. The identity of each model is initially hidden, and results are voided if the model reveals its identity in the response itself. The user then gets to pick which model provided what they judge to be the &quot;better&quot; result, with additional options for a &quot;tie&quot; or &quot;both are bad.&quot; Only after providing a pairwise ranking does the user get to se…</span>

                              <span>Hackers unbricked a train in Poland that had been deliberately disabled by its manufacturer. Now the manufacturer is threatening legal action against the hackers despite evidence it sabotaged the trains. From a report: The manufacturer is also now demanding that the repaired trains immediately be removed from service because they have been &quot;hacked,&quot; and thus might now be unsafe, a claim they also cannot substantiate. 

The situation is a heavy machinery example of something that happens across most categories of electronics, from phones, laptops, health devices, and wearables to tractors and, apparently, trains. In this case, NEWAG, the manufacturer of the Impuls family of trains, put code in the train&#x27;s control systems that prevented them from running if a GPS tracker detected that it spent a certain number of days in an independent repair company&#x27;s maintenance center, and also prevented it from running if certain components had been replaced without a manufacturer-approved serial number. 

This anti-repair mechanism is called &quot;parts pairing,&quot; and is a common frustration for farmers who want to repair their John Deere tractors without authorization from the company. It&#x27;s also used by Apple to prevent independent repair of iPhones.

                              <span>Overclocking AMD&#x27;s Ryzen Threadripper 7000 series blows a fuse, indicating modification. However, AMD has told Tom&#x27;s Hardware that this does not automatically invalidate the warranty of these top-tier workstation CPUs. From the report: &quot;Threadripper 7000 Series processors do contain a fuse that is blown when overclocking is enabled. To be clear, blowing this fuse does not void your warranty. Statements that enabling an overclocking/overvolting feature will &#x27;void&#x27; the processor warranty are not correct. Per AMD&#x27;s standard Terms of Sale, the warranty excludes any damage that results from overclocking/overvolting the processor. However, other unrelated issues could still qualify for warranty repair/replacement,&quot; an AMD representative told Tom&#x27;s Hardware. 

In summation, overclocking your Ryzen Threadripper Pro 7000 or non-Pro processor will not void the warranty -- only damages directly resulting from overclocking will. As always, AMD isn&#x27;t against overclocking. If it was, the chipmaker wouldn&#x27;t advertise overclocking support as one of the features of the WRX90 and TRX50 platforms. Only OEM systems lack overclocking support.

                              <span>Apple has said it now requires a judge&#x27;s order to hand over information about its customers&#x27; push notification to law enforcement, putting the iPhone maker&#x27;s policy in line with rival Google and raising the hurdle officials must clear to get app data about users. From a report: The new policy was not formally announced but appeared sometime over the past few days on Apple&#x27;s publicly available law enforcement guidelines. It follows the revelation from Oregon Senator Ron Wyden that officials were requesting such data from Apple as well as from Google, the unit of Alphabet that makes the operating system for Android phones. 

Apps of all kinds rely on push notifications to alert smartphone users to incoming messages, breaking news, and other updates. These are the audible &quot;dings&quot; or visual indicators users get when they receive an email or their sports team wins a game. What users often do not realize is that almost all such notifications travel over Google and Apple&#x27;s servers. In a letter first disclosed by Reuters last week, Wyden said the practice gave the two companies unique insight into traffic flowing from those apps to users, putting them &quot;in a unique position to facilitate government surveillance of how users are using particular apps.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: If you bought a new smart TV during any of the holiday sales, there&#x27;s likely to be an uninvited guest watching along with you. The most popular smart TVs sold today use automatic content recognition (ACR), a kind of ad surveillance technology that collects data on everything you view and sends it to a proprietary database to identify what you&#x27;re watching and serve you highly targeted ads. The software is largely hidden from view, and it&#x27;s complicated to opt out. Many consumers aren&#x27;t aware of ACR, let alone that it&#x27;s active on their shiny new TVs. If that&#x27;s you, and you&#x27;d like to turn it off, we&#x27;re going to show you how. 

First, a quick primer on the tech: ACR identifies what&#x27;s displayed on your television, including content served through a cable TV box, streaming service, or game console, by continuously grabbing screenshots and comparing them to a massive database of media and advertisements. Think of it as a Shazam-like service constantly running in the background while your TV is on. 

These TVs can capture and identify 7,200 images per hour, or approximately two every second. The data is then used for content recommendations and ad targeting, which is a huge business; advertisers spent an estimated $18.6 billion on smart TV ads in 2022, according to market research firm eMarketer. For anyone who&#x27;d rather not have ACR looking over their shoulder while they watch, we&#x27;ve put together a guide to turning it off on three of the most popular smart TV software platforms in use last year. Depending on the platform, turning off ACR took us between 10 and 37 clicks.

                              <span>Apple is set to be hit by a ban on its App Store rules that govern music-streaming rivals and a potential hefty fine in the European Union&#x27;s latest attempt to limit the power of Big Tech. From a report: EU regulators are putting the finishing touches to a decision that would prohibit Apple&#x27;s practice of blocking music services from pushing their users away from the App Store to alternative subscription options, according to people familiar with the investigation. The decision is slated for early next year, they added. As part of the upcoming decision, Apple runs the risk of a potential fine of as much as 10% of its annual sales -- although EU penalties seldom reach that level and orders for companies to change their business models can be more hard-hitting.

                              <span>Google&#x27;s making the second generation of Imagen, its AI model that can create and edit images given a text prompt, more widely available -- at least to Google Cloud customers using Vertex AI who&#x27;ve been approved for access. From a report: But the company isn&#x27;t disclosing which data it used to train the new model -- nor introducing a way for creators who might&#x27;ve inadvertently contributed to the data set to opt out or apply for compensation. 

Called Imagen 2, Google&#x27;s enhanced model -- which was quietly launched in preview at the tech giant&#x27;s I/O conference in May -- was developed using technology from Google DeepMind, Google&#x27;s flagship AI lab. Compared to the first-gen Imagen, it&#x27;s &quot;significantly&quot; improved in terms of image quality, Google claims (the company bizarrely refused to share image samples prior to this morning), and introduces new capabilities including the ability to render text and logos. &quot;If you want to create images with a text overlay -- for example, advertising -- you can do that,&quot; Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian said during a press briefing on Tuesday.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: This year has been marked by many terrifying things, but perhaps the most surprising of the 2023 horrors was ... eye drops. The seemingly innocuous teeny squeeze bottle made for alarming headlines numerous times during our current revolution around the sun, with lengthy lists of recalls, startling factory inspections, and ghastly reports of people developing near-untreatable bacterial infections, losing their eyes and vision, and dying. 

Recapping this unexpected threat to health, the Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday released an advisory titled &quot;What You Should Know about Eye Drops&quot; in hopes of keeping the dangers of this year from leaking into the next. Among the notable points from the regulator was this stark pronouncement: No one should ever use any homeopathic ophthalmic products, and every single such product should be pulled off the market. The point is unexpected, given that none of the high-profile infections and recalls this year involved homeopathic products. But, it should be welcomed by any advocates of evidence-based medicine.

                              <span>More than 190 governments at the United Nations climate conference approved an agreement Wednesday calling for the world to transition away from fossil fuels, an accord that bridged differences between big energy-producing nations and countries that want to completely phase out coal, oil and natural gas. From a report: The deal, the result of all-night talks, calls for &quot;transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner.&quot; It says the shift to clean energy for the global economy should accelerate this decade with the aim of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. 

Scientists say that is crucial to fulfilling the Paris accord, the landmark climate agreement that calls for governments to attempt to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial temperatures. The deal marks the first time a U.N. climate agreement has called for governments to cut back on all fossil fuels.

                              <span>Regulators in the UK are weighing a cap on some of the fees that Visa and Mastercard charge local merchants for each card transaction, seeking to rein in charges that have risen fivefold since Brexit. From a report: After a monthslong review, the UK&#x27;s Payment Systems Regulator said it&#x27;s concerned that the payment giants have no effective competition, especially when it comes to the interchange fees they charge UK merchants when a consumer carrying a card issued by a bank in the European Economic Area makes an online purchase. 

For now, the PSR is proposing to restore those fees to the pre-Brexit levels of 0.3% of a purchase price for credit cards and 0.2% for debit cards. For credit cards, those fees have risen in recent years to as high as 1.5% and the PSR estimated that the increases cost UK businesses as much as $250 million last year. The two companies have been under fire from a bevy of regulators and lawmakers around the world for the fees they charge. While it usually amounts to just pennies per purchase, the fees do add up: US merchants spent a record $160.7 billion on swipe fees last year, up 16.7% from 2021, according to the Nilson Report, an industry publication.

                              <span>Last month, Futurism noticed Sports Illustrated was publishing AI-generated articles under fake author biographies. Although the magazine removed the articles in question and released a statement blaming the issue on a contractor, it wasn&#x27;t enough to quell the widespread backlash. Today, Sports Illustrated&#x27;s publisher, Arena Group, fired the sports media outlet&#x27;s CEO. The Hill reports: The Arena Group, which publishes Sports Illustrated, said Monday that its board of directors had moved to fire CEO Ross Levinsohn. The board took the action to &quot;improve the operational efficiency and revenue of the company,&quot; the company said. Manoj Bhargava will serve as Arena Group&#x27;s interim chief executive officer effective this week. Levinsohn was the CEO of Arena Group since 2019 and previously was the publisher of the Los Angeles Times.

                              <span>According to the Wall Street Journal, Apple is including new Stolen Device Protection in iOS 17.3 that requires authentication through Face ID or Touch ID to perform certain actions. The Verge reports: The new feature appears to come in response to the concerns raised in previous reports by The Wall Street Journal describing how thieves watch their victims type in their iPhone passcodes and then steal their devices. This gives thieves access to a trove of personal and financial information stored on the device, allowing them to lock victims out of their iCloud accounts and spend thousands of dollars using saved payment information.
 
If you opt in to the feature, you would have to verify your identity with face or fingerprint biometrics when doing things like viewing your saved passwords in iCloud Keychain, applying for a new Apple Card, factory resetting your device, using saved payment methods in Safari, and turning off Lost Mode. This way, thieves wouldn&#x27;t be able to steal your information even if they have your phone and the passcode.
 
For even more sensitive actions, like changing your Apple ID password, changing your iPhone passcode, or turning off Find My, the new Stolen Device Protection feature adds an additional hurdle if the device is somewhere other than locations you often frequent, like at home or in the office. It requires you to not only verify your identity with Face ID or Touch ID but also wait one hour and then repeat the authentication process again.

                              <span>According to the Wall Street Journal, Microsoft wants to use nuclear energy to power its artificial intelligence operations. And in order to help cut the red tape required to make that happen, Microsoft plans to use AI. From a report: A Microsoft team has spent months building an AI trained on nuclear regulations and licensing requirements to help the tech giant fill out all the applications it needs to build its own power plants. This typically takes years and millions, but Microsoft is urgently looking for more power to bring next-generation AI to life.
 
That&#x27;s because the larger the model and the more capable it becomes, the more power it requires. Microsoft today reflects the sensibilities of its founder, Bill Gates, in that the company believes in carbon-neutral energy sources -- and, like Gates who himself invests in nuclear power innovation, the company seems to see more potential in nuclear than other renewable sources of energy.
 
&quot;If we&#x27;re going to do that carbon-free, we&#x27;re going to need all the tools in the tool kit,&quot; Michelle Patron, Microsoft&#x27;s senior director of sustainability policy, told the Journal.

                              <span>Throughout my career, people have compared software development to
  “traditional” engineering, usually in a way to scold software developers for not
  doing a proper job. As someone who got his degree in Electronic Engineering,
  this resonated with me early in my career. But this way of thinking is flawed
  because most people have the wrong impression of how engineering works in
  practice.
Glenn Vanderburg has spent a lot of time digging
  into these misconceptions, and I strongly urge anyone who wants to compare
  software development to engineering to watch his talk Real Software Engineering. It&#x27;s also well worth
  listening to his interview on the podcast Oddly
  Influenced. Sadly I&#x27;ve not been able to persuade him to write this
  material down - it would make a great article.
Another good thinker on this relationship is Hillel Wayne. He interviewed a
  bunch of “crossovers” - people who had worked both in traditional engineering
  and in software. He wrote up what he learned in a series of essays, starting
  with Are We Really Engineers?</span>

                              <span>Politico reports that the climate bill passed in America in 2022 &quot;has ignited a new zeal among leaders around the world for the kind of winner-picking, subsidy-flush governing that has been out of fashion in many countries for the past 40 years.&quot; 

The bill&#x27;s &quot;mix of lavish support for clean energy technologies and efforts to box out foreign competitors is also promoting a kind of green patriotism — and even some politicians on the right, at least outside the U.S., say that&#x27;s a climate message they can sell.&quot;
[The bill] is having a real-world impact as investors shift their money to the U.S. from abroad, hungry to take advantage of the tax breaks. In July, for example, Swiss solar manufacturer Meyer Burger canned plans to build a factory in Germany, choosing Arizona instead. That has left …</span>

But the next week was even more impressive, reports Forbes, retaining most of its box office figure with &quot;an incredibly strong 90% hold across the three-day Friday-Saturday-Sunday frame, for what appears to be the best second weekend hold for a wide release in 2023.&quot;
Through the week, Godzilla Minus One topped the North American charts four out of five weekdays on overwhelmingly positive word of mouth. Good buzz grew through the week as more viewers and critics saw and recommend the film...

                              <span>David Shepardson reports via Reuters: U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said she expects to make around a dozen semiconductor chips funding awards within the next year, including multi-billion dollar announcements that could drastically reshape U.S. chip production. She announced the first award on Monday -- $35 million to a BAE Systems facility in Hampshire to produce chips for fighter planes from the &quot;Chips for America&quot; semiconductor manufacturing and research subsidy program approved by Congress in August 2022.
 
&quot;Next year we&#x27;ll get into some of the bigger ones with leading-edge fabs,&quot; Raimondo told reporters. &quot;A year from now I think we will have made 10 or 12 similar announcements, some of them multi-billion dollar announcements.&quot; In an interview with Reuters, Raimondo said that the number of awards could go higher than 12. She said she wants the percentage of semiconductors produced in the United States to rise from about 12% to closer to 20% -- though that is still down from 40% in 1990 -- and to have at least two &quot;leading-edge&quot; U.S. manufacturing clusters. In addition, she wants the U.S. to have cutting-edge memory and packaging production and to &quot;meet the military&#x27;s needs for current and mature&quot; chips. Raimondo noted that the U.S. currently does not have any cutting-edge manufacturing production and wants to get that to about 10%.

                              <span>Bill Toulas reports via BleepingComputer: Miklos Daniel Brody, a cloud engineer, was sentenced to two years in prison and a restitution of $529,000 for wiping the code repositories of his former employer in retaliation for being fired by the company. According to the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) announcement, Brody was fired on March 11, 2020, from First Republic Bank (FRB) in San Francisco, where he worked as a cloud engineer. The court documents state that Brody&#x27;s employment was terminated after he violated company policies by connecting a USB drive containing pornography to company computers.
 
Following his dismissal, Brody allegedly refused to return his work laptop and instead used his still-valid account to access the bank&#x27;s computer network and cause damages estimated to be above $220,000. &quot;Among other things, Brody deleted the bank&#x27;s code repositories, ran a malicious script to delete logs, left taunts within the bank&#x27;s code for former colleagues, and impersonated other bank employees by opening sessions in their names,&quot; describes the U.S. DOJ announcement. &quot;He also emailed himself proprietary bank code that he had worked on as an employee, which was valued at over $5,000.&quot;
 
After the incident, Brody falsely reported to the San Francisco Police Department that the FRB-issued laptop had been stolen from his car. He continued to uphold this story when interviewed by United States Secret Service agents following his arrest in March 2021. Eventually, in April 2023, Brody pleaded guilty to lying about the laptop and to two charges concerning violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. In addition to the two-year prison term and the payment of the restitution, Brody will serve three years of supervised release.

Cheese&#x27;s Pizza Time Theatre. While 600 of the restaurants still operate today, &quot;the company is in the process of remodeling its more than 400 U.S. locations,&quot; reports the Los Angeles Times, &quot;and the last 30 or so remaining animatronic bands are being shown the door in favor of interactive dance floors and large screens that feature Chuck E. and pals in animated form.&quot;
That is, they&#x27;re being evicted everywhere but Northridge, Los Angeles... The goal — or hope — for the company is to have at least one location that can serve both new generations as well as nostalgia hunters, especially fans of animatronic figures.

From the report: Kyivstar has 24.3 million mobile subscribers - more than half of Ukraine&#x27;s population - as well as over 1.1 million home internet subscribers. Its CEO Oleksandr Komarov said the attack was &quot;a result of&quot; the war with Russia, although he did not say which Russian body he believed to be responsible, and that the company&#x27;s IT infrastructure had been &quot;partially destroyed.&quot; &quot;(The attack) significantly damaged (our) infrastructure, limited access, we could not counter it at the virtual level, so we shut down Kyivstar p…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Verge: While the video game industry had already largely given up on E3 -- once the largest video game trade show in the industry and the biggest video game showcase event of the year -- there was always the chance it would return after multiple years of cancellations. However, in a statement to The Washington Post today, E3&#x27;s organizer confirmed that the show is permanently canceled.
 
&quot;We know it&#x27;s difficult to say goodbye to such a beloved event, but it&#x27;s the right thing to do given the new opportunities our industry has to reach fans and partners,&quot; Stanley Pierre-Louis, the CEO of the Entertainment Software Association, the nonprofit trade organization that ran E3, told the Post. Pierre-Louis alluded to the biggest reason for E3&#x27;s precipitous collapse and ultimate demise: game developers and publishers had increasingly moved away from the event in order to put on their own less costly showcases targeted directly to fans, rather than the industry insiders and journalists that E3 typically catered to. The last E3 was held in 2019. The 2020 event was canceled due to the pandemic, only to return as a digital showcase in 2021. A virtual-only event was scheduled to take place the following year but was canceled, with promises that it would return in 2023. Then, that was canceled, with a possible 2024 return date. Now, it&#x27;s been confirmed that E3 is never coming back.

                              <span>Ed Targett reports via The Stack: Broadcom is killing off VMware&#x27;s on-premises perpetual licenses -- and getting set to strong-arm VMware customers onto subscriptions, by also ending the sale of Support and Subscription renewals for such customers. VMware described this to customers as part of its plan to &quot;complete the transition of all VMware by Broadcom solutions to subscription licenses.&quot; &quot;We are [also] ending the sale of Support and Subscription (SnS) renewals for perpetual offerings beginning today&quot; SVP Krish Prasad said in a FAQ.
 
VMware perpetual licenses were described by its own Office of the CTO earlier this year in a short blog as its &quot;most renowned licenses.&quot; The on-premises licenses for the virtualization software come with a license key, with SnS separately licensing users for support and software updates. Perpetual license keys never expire but the SnS lapses and now will not, seemingly, be renewed -- meaning that customers reluctant to shift to an alternative licensing model will be left without support or updates.
 
VMware customers &quot;may continue using perpetual licenses with active support contracts. We will continue to provide support as defined in contractual commitments. We encourage customers to review their inventory of perpetual licenses, including Support Services renewal and expiration dates,&quot; Broadcom said rather menacingly, on December 10. The company is also announcing a new &quot;bring-your-own-subscription license option, providing license portability to VMware validated hybrid cloud endpoints running VMware Cloud Foundation,&quot; it added, without initially sharing details.

                              <span>Connor Jones reports via The Register: DLang is among the newer breed of memory-safe languages being endorsed by Western security agencies over the past few years, the same type of language that cyber criminals are switching to. At least three new DLang-based malware strains have been used in attacks on worldwide organizations spanning the manufacturing, agriculture, and physical security industries, Cisco Talos revealed today. The attacks form part of what&#x27;s being called &quot;Operation Blacksmith&quot; and are attributed to a group tracked as Andariel, believed to be a sub-division of the Lazarus Group -- North Korea&#x27;s state-sponsored offensive cyber unit. [...]
 
The researchers noted that DLang is an uncommon choice for writing malware, but a shift towards newer languages and frameworks is one that&#x27;s been accelerating over the last few years -- in malware coding as in the larger programming world. Rust, however, has often shown itself to be the preferred choice out of what is a fairly broad selection of languages deemed to be memory-safe. AlphV/BlackCat was the first ransomware group to make such a shift last year, re-writing its payload in Rust to offer its affiliates a more reliable tool. A month later, the now-shuttered Hive group did the same thing, and many others followed after that. Other groups to snub Rust include China-based Sandman which was recently observed using Lua-based malware, believed to be part of a wider shift toward Lua development from Chinese attackers.

Whether the platform had any impact on pirate IPTV providers offering the big game last Friday is unclear but plans supporting a full-on assault are pressing ahead.

                              <span>The FTC is considering an investigation into Microsoft&#x27;s investment in OpenAI to determine if the company broke any antitrust laws. The Register reports: Despite the money poured into it over the years, OpenAI was founded as a non-profit in 2015, and Microsoft&#x27;s investment does not amount to control of the company. Microsoft chief communications officer Frank X Shaw underlined attempts to dampen down industry talk of a probe: &quot;While details of our agreement remain confidential, it is important to note that Microsoft does not own any portion of OpenAI and is simply entitled to share of profit distributions.&quot;
 
At the end of last week, the UK&#x27;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched a consultation to ask interested parties to comment on Microsoft&#x27;s relationship with ChatGPT developer, and if it could be construed as a merger that potentially skews competition. If so, the CMA will itself launch an official inspection.

                              <span>With iOS 17.2 rolling out today, Apple is giving users the ability to record spatial videos on their iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. &quot;The new feature lets users film in three dimensions and experience their favorite memories and special moments on Apple Vision Pro, the upcoming mixed-reality headset,&quot; reports TechCrunch. From the report: In order to create a three-dimensional video, Apple explains that the iPhone uses both the main and ultrawide cameras when recording. This is then saved as a single file within a new album in the Photos app titled &quot;Spatial.&quot; The videos will also sync across devices with iCloud. Spatial videos are captured in 1080p resolution at 30 frames per second. Spatial video recording can be enabled in Settings by toggling on &quot;Spatial Video for Apple Vision Pro&quot; in the Camera section under Formats. Apple suggests holding the iPhone in landscape orientation for optimal results. Spatial videos can be viewed on all iPhones and other devices; however, they&#x27;ll appear as regular, 2D videos.
 
The new feature allows users to record videos that Apple&#x27;s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, Greg Joswiak, describes as &quot;magical&quot; and &quot;setting a new bar for what&#x27;s possible.&quot; While that&#x27;s marketing speak, it&#x27;s a differentiator for Apple&#x27;s high-end iPhone, and will deepen users&#x27; connections with Apple&#x27;s latest product, the AR/VR headset, launching next year. As part of today&#x27;s release, Apple also launched its Journal app, which is designed to allow iOS users to record key moments in their lives.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Reuters: China&#x27;s Huawei will start building its mobile phone network equipment factory in France next year, a source familiar with the matter said, pressing ahead with its first plant in Europe even as some European governments curb the use of the firm&#x27;s 5G gear. The company outlined plans for the factory with an initial investment of 200 million euros ($215.28 million) in 2020, but the roll-out was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the source said on Monday. The source did not give a timeline for when the factory in Brumath, near Strasbourg, will be up and running. A French government source said the site was expected to open in 2025.

                              <span>Google Play Movies &amp; TV will be replaced with Google TV on January 17, 2024. 9to5Google reports: Since the 2020 launch of the Google TV platform, that branding has replaced Play Movies &amp; TV in areas such as mobile apps, but that&#x27;s also led to the choice to do away with Play Movies &amp; TV branding basically everywhere else. In October, that decision also made its way to Android TV, and the app has not been working ever since. Despite some confusion over the past few days, the app currently just redirects to Android TV&#x27;s &quot;Shop&quot; tab, which has been widely available for months.
 
In a new post, Google explains that it will do away with the last parts of Google Play Movies &amp; TV in January 2024: &quot;With these changes, Google Play Movies &amp; TV will no longer be available on Android TV devices or the Google Play website.* However, you&#x27;ll still be able to access all of your previously purchased titles (including active rentals) on Android TV devices, Google TV devices, the Google TV mobile app (Android and iOS), and YouTube.&quot;
 
On January 17, Play Movies &amp; TV will officially cease for good on Android TV. For anyone who does still have the app working -- again, most users cannot use the app already -- the &quot;Shop&quot; tab will become the only option. Similarly, Google says that Play Movies &amp; TV will cease on other remaining platforms that same date. Any cable boxes with the app integrated will also lose it, and in turn pushed to the YouTube app for continued access to purchased content. Web access via play.google.com/movies will also go away, with youtube.com/movies becoming the alternative.

                              <span>The Browser Company&#x27;s Chromium-based Arc browser, which aims to rethink the whole browser UI with a sidebar for tabs and lots of personalization options, is finally coming to Windows. In a post on X, the Browser Company says it&#x27;s sent out the first Windows beta invites. It&#x27;s currently only available for iOS and Mac users. Slashdot reader dokjest shares the email they received: Hey there, Hursh here, CTO at the Browser Co, with some exciting news! A little while ago, you signed up for a brand new browser, Arc -- one that The Verge called &quot;The Chrome replacement I&#x27;ve been waiting for&quot; and Shopify&#x27;s CEO named as &quot;the best browser.&quot; Well, starting today, we&#x27;re onboarding our very first beta testers to Arc on Windows. And you&#x27;re next!
 
Over the coming weeks, our team will be onboarding hundreds of beta testers to Arc. And come January, we&#x27;ll be welcoming 1,000s of you from the waitlist every week. If you don&#x27;t mind a few bugs and some rough edges, sign up as a beta tester and we&#x27;ll prioritize your invite to Arc! For us, this period leading up to our Windows release is about crafting the very best version of Arc that we can. And that means learning from you -- what you love, what&#x27;s missing, what doesn&#x27;t feel quite right. It still feels surreal to say, but it really does all begin today. Follow along for some fun on isarconwindowsyet.com -- And we&#x27;ll see you very soon!
 
- Hursh and The Browser Co Crew
 
P.S. If you have a friend on Windows with one too many tabs, who could use a better browser -- forward this on to them, too! If you want to get on the beta waitlist, you can sign up here.

Norton operates more than 40 clinics and hospitals in and around Louisville, Kentucky, and is the city&#x27;s third-largest private employer. The organization has more than 20,000 employees, and more than 3,000 total providers on its medical staff, according to its website. In a filing with Maine&#x27;s attorney general on Friday, Norton said that the sensitive data of approximately 2.5 million patients, as well as employees and their dependents, was accessed during its May ransomware attack.

                              <span>Nvidia, the world&#x27;s most valuable chipmaker, has become one of the most prolific investors in AI start-ups this year, seeking to capitalise on its position as the dominant provider of AI processors. From a report: Silicon Valley-based Nvidia said on Monday it had invested in &quot;more than two dozen&quot; companies this year, from big new AI platforms valued in the billions of dollars to smaller start-ups applying AI to industries such as healthcare or energy. According to estimates by Dealroom, which tracks venture capital investments, Nvidia participated in 35 deals in 2023, almost six times more than last year. 

That made the chipmaker the most active large-scale investor in AI in a banner year for dealmaking in the sector, outstripping Silicon Valley&#x27;s largest venture firms such as Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia, according to Dealroom, excluding small-scale accelerator funds such as Y Combinator that place many smaller bets. &quot;Broadly, for Nvidia, the number one criteria [for making start-up investments] is relevancy,&quot; Mohamed Siddeek, head of its dedicated venture arm NVentures, told the Financial Times. &quot;Companies that use our technology, who depend on our technology, who build their businesses on our technologyâ...âI can&#x27;t think of a situation where we&#x27;ve invested in a company that did not use Nvidia products.&quot;

                              <span>Microsoft is teaming up with labor unions to create &quot;an open dialogue&quot; on how AI will impact workers. From a report: The software giant is forming an alliance with the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, which comprises 60 labor unions representing 12.5 million workers, according to a statement on Monday. Under the partnership, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft will provide labor leaders and workers with formal training on how AI works. The education sessions will start in the winter of 2024. Microsoft will also begin gathering feedback from labor groups and will focus on unions and workers in &quot;key selected sectors.&quot; 

The initiative marks the first formal collaboration on AI between labor unions and the technology industry and coincides with growing concerns that artificial intelligence could displace workers. The agreement also includes a template for &quot;neutrality&quot; terms that would make it easier for unions to organize at Microsoft. The move expands an approach the company already agreed to for its video game workers and lays the groundwork for broader unionization at Microsoft. Neutrality agreements commit companies not to wage anti-union campaigns in response to workers organizing.

                              <span>A draft deal to cut global fossil fuel production is &quot;grossly insufficient&quot; and &quot;incoherent&quot; and will not stop the world from avoiding dangerous climate breakdown, according to delegates at the UN&#x27;s Cop28 summit. From a report: The text put forward by the summit presidency after 10 days of wrangling was received with concern and anger by many climate experts and politicians, though others welcomed elements of the draft including the first mention in a Cop text of reducing fossil fuel production. Some countries are despairing that the text does not require a full phase-out of fossil fuels. 

Cedric Schuster of Samoa, chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, said: &quot;We will not sign our death certificate. We cannot sign on to text that does not have strong commitments on phasing out fossil fuels.&quot; The Cop28 presidency released a draft text in the early evening on Monday, which called for &quot;reducing both consumption and production of fossil fuels, in a just, orderly and equitable manner, so as to achieve net zero by, before or around 2050, in keeping with the science.&quot; 

The text avoids highly contentious calls for a &quot;phase-out&quot; or &quot;phase-down&quot; of fossil fuels, which have been the focus of deep disagreement among the more than 190 countries meeting in Dubai. But instead of requiring fossil fuel producers to cut their output, it frames such reductions as optional, by calling on countries to &quot;take actions that could include&quot; reducing fossil fuels. &quot;That one word &#x27;could&#x27; just kills everything,&quot; said Eamon Ryan, Ireland&#x27;s environment minister.

                              <span>The faceoff between Apple and Beeper has entered another round. Days after Apple managed to block Beeper Mini from seamlessly sending and receiving iMessages on Android, Beeper says the app is up and running again -- sort of. From a report: See, Beeper Mini works a little differently this time: you must now sign in with an Apple ID, whereas previously it would automatically register you to iMessage via your phone number. Beeper says it&#x27;s working on a fix to restore phone number registration with iMessage, but until then, your friends won&#x27;t be able to send iMessages directly to your phone number. Instead, the blue bubbles will have to come to and from your email address. That&#x27;s not nearly as convenient, but at the end of the day, it&#x27;s still iMessage. 

Another change is that for now, owing to what could escalate into a cat-and-mouse game with Apple, Beeper Mini will be free to use. &quot;Things have been a bit chaotic, and we&#x27;re not comfortable subjecting paying users to this,&quot; the company wrote in a blog post today about the update. The app originally required a $2-per-month subscription. Apple&#x27;s statement on Friday made clear that it won&#x27;t hesitate to shut down further attempts to dupe its servers into believing Android phones are genuine Apple devices.

                              <span>Human trafficking to staff cyber scam call centers, once isolated to Southeast Asia, has expanded beyond the region, according to an Interpol investigation revealing new evidence of abuse in South America and the Middle East. Previous hotspots since 2021 were Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. From a report: The latest five-month operation discovered that victims from Malaysia were being trafficked to work in Peruvian call centers and Ugandan victims were being trafficked to Dubai for the same reason, only to be diverted to Thailand and then Myanmar. Police in Telangana, India, recently registered their first case of human trafficking for the purposes of cyber fraud. An accountant was lured to southeast Asia to work for a cyber fraud operation before eventually being returned in exchange for a ransom payment. 

Interpol said that in Myanmar alone, it identified trafficking victims originating from at least 22 different countries, although most come from the country&#x27;s Kayin and Shan states. Operation Storm Makers II has led to hundreds of arrests and the rescue of more than 140 individuals, although the scale of the threat is much larger; many of the 360 investigations remain open and ongoing. Fake job ads luring victims with promises of high pay for light work in IT, marketing, modeling, and other roles now utilize AI translation tools to target non-Chinese speakers, expanding the victim pool, according to the report.

                              <span>The recently-departed watchdog in charge of monitoring facial recognition technology in UK has joined the private firm he controversially approved, paving the way for the mass roll-out of biometric surveillance cameras in high streets across the country. From a report: In a move critics have dubbed an &quot;outrageous conflict of interest,&quot; Professor Fraser Sampson, former biometrics and surveillance camera commissioner, has joined Facewatch as a non-executive director. Sampson left his watchdog role on 31 October, with Companies House records showing he was registered as a company director at Facewatch the following day, 1 November. 

Campaigners claim this might mean he was negotiating his Facewatch contract while in post, and have urged the advisory committee on business appointments to investigate if it may have &quot;compromised his work in public office.&quot; It is understood that the committee is currently considering the issue. Facewatch uses biometric cameras to check faces against a watch list and, despite widespread concern over the technology, has received backing from the Home Office, and has already been introduced in hundreds of high-street shops and supermarkets.

                              <span>Fei-Fei Li and John Etchemendy, the founding co-directors of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, in an op-ed on WSJ argue that AI is too important to be left entirely in the hands of the big tech companies: Among other things, 2023 will be remembered as the year artificial intelligence went mainstream. But while Americans from every corner of the country began dabbling with tools like ChatGPT and Midjourney, we believe 2023 is also the year Congress failed to act on what we see as the big picture: AI&#x27;s impact will be far bigger than the products that companies are releasing at a breakneck pace. AI is a broad, general-purpose technology with profound implications for society that cannot be overstated. 

[...] So what needs to happen? President Biden has set the stage, and with all this attention, it&#x27;s time for Congress to act. They need to pass the Create AI Act, adhere to the elements called on by the new executive order, and invest more in the public sector to ensure America&#x27;s leadership in creating AI technology steeped in the values we stand for. We also encourage an investment in human capital to bring more talent to the U.S. to work in the field of AI within academia and the government. 

But why does this matter? Because this technology isn&#x27;t just good for optimizing ad revenue for technology companies, but can fuel the next generation of scientific discovery, ranging from nuclear fusion to curing cancer. Furthermore, to truly understand this technology, including its sometimes unpredictable emergent capabilities and behaviors, public-sector researchers urgently need to replicate and examine the under-the-hood architecture of these models. That&#x27;s why government research labs need to take a larger role in AI. [...]

                              <span>New York has partnered with chip firms to build $10 billion semiconductor research site at University at Albany, featuring cutting-edge ASML equipment to develop most advanced chips. From a report: Once the machinery is installed, the project and its partners will begin work on next-generation chip manufacturing there, according to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul&#x27;s office. The partners include tech giant IBM, memory manufacturer Micron and chip manufacturing equipment makers Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron. 

The expansion could help New York&#x27;s bid to be designated a research hub under last year&#x27;s $53 billion Chips Act. That legislation included $11 billion for a National Semiconductor Technology Center to foster domestic chip research and development. Expanding domestic chip manufacturing and research has become a federal and state-level priority in recent years as concern grows in the U.S. over China&#x27;s expanding grasp over the industry. Chips are increasingly seen as a crux of geopolitical power, underlying advanced weapons for militaries and sophisticated artificial-intelligence systems.

                              <span>As racetracks close and old aircraft engines get harder to find, the crowd-pleasing spectacles are endangered. From a report: Magdatude is a 1946 Chevy pickup modified with a jet engine. It wasn&#x27;t put there for speed. On a rainy September night, the truck rumbled onto the infield of the Rockford Speedway in Illinois, stopping with its business end about 10 feet from a junk minibus. The engine whined to life and shot a blast of fire from its afterburner, engulfing the bus until it was reduced to a charred metal skeleton. &quot;There&#x27;s nothing left of that thing!&quot; the announcer shouted. &quot;Holy cow!&quot; 

It was a textbook jet car meltdown, once a common spectacle at racetracks and drag strips. The fiery craft has become endangered as venues close, spare parts grow scarce and practitioners dwindle. &quot;I think realistically there&#x27;s going to be a few people that keep it alive,&quot; said Josh Baumgartner, Magdatude&#x27;s owner. &quot;We&#x27;re hoping to be among them.&quot; 

A former Navy mechanic named Doug Rose helped to popularize meltdowns after he created a dragster using a jet engine from a scrapyard. According to his widow, Jeanne, he conducted his first fire show around 1968 with a car he named the Green Mamba. Over the years, he honed his craft until he could torch a half-dozen vehicles at once. &quot;Doug&#x27;s objective was to please the people,&quot; she said.

                              <span>&quot;Over the years, Austin has seen a huge migration of tech companies moving to the city, from billionaire owners of Twitter (X) to the largest search engine in the world,&quot; according to a local news site in Texas. 

&quot;But many startups are now choosing to leave the capital city they once flocked to because of the rising cost of living, low funding, and lack of diversity, according to TechCrunch. &quot;
On Thursday, December 7, the cloud computing company VMWare announced it was laying off 577 employees in Austin as part of a nationwide job reduction to cut costs, according to the Austin American-Statesman. TechCrunch is reporting that startup founders, like Techstars Managing Director Amos Schwartzfarb, are announcing their decisions to leave Austin&#x27;s &quot;lackluster&quot; startup scene... In 2022, Meta abandoned plans to move into the biggest skyscraper in Austin, and Google froze plans to move into 35 floors of a different downtown building, despite paying rent to the developer, according to the Washington Post... 

In January, CEO Don Ward of Laundris, a B2B enterprise industrial software platform, announced he would be relocating his company to Tulsa because it reminded him &quot;of where Austin was 10 years ago in terms of the tech ecosystem being built,&quot; according to Tulsa World. Last month, startup unicorn Cart, an e-commerce business, announced it was moving its headquarters back to Houston after relocating to Austin in late 2021, according to TechCrunch.

                              <span>Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a technique for building
	software that guides software development by writing tests. It was
	developed by Kent
	Beck in the late 1990&#x27;s as part of
	Extreme Programming. In essence we follow three simple
	steps repeatedly:
Write a test for the next bit of functionality you want to add.
Write the functional code until the test passes.
Refactor both new and old code to make it well structured.


Although these three steps, often summarized as Red - Green -
  Refactor, are the heart of the process, there&#x27;s also a vital initial
  step where we write out a list of test cases first. We then pick one of these
  tests, apply red-green-refactor to it, and once we&#x27;re done pick the next.
  Sequencing the tests properly is a skill, we want to pick tests that drive us

This post includes:
A description of what this means (What is this feature?)
A call for help (What to watch out for and Request for feedback)
Implementation details (Design considerations and implementation details)
An outline of what is planned for the future (Plan for the future)
In short, we are asking people who use the nightly channel to enable this feature and report any issues you encounter on the Cargo issue tracker.
To enable it, place the following in your Cargo config file (typically located in ~/.cargo/config.toml or %USERPROFILE%\.cargo\config.toml for Windows):

The letter has shaken up the climate talks in a critical phase, as nations spar over whether to include historic language in an emerging climate agreement that calls for a phase-out of fossil fuels... &quot;OPEC&#x27;s letter is outrageous. OPEC wants to talk about emissions, but not the source of the emissions,&quot; said Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), who is visiting COP28 as part of a congressional delegation. &quot;It would be like the tobacco industry saying you can talk about lung cancer, but you can&#x27;t talk about cigarettes.

And earlier this morning, Romero shocked the gaming world by posting six words on X.

The official page for the long-awaited new Doom episode promises a 2 megabyte file &quot;packed with some hardcore classic DOOM punishment — beware of Ultra-Violence mode!&quot; There&#x27;s nine new maps with names like &quot;Wrathful Reckoning&quot; and &quot;Vengeance Unleashed&quot;. And the site is also selling an upgrade with a THORR soundtrack — priced at €6.66 — along with t-shirts, boxed editions of the original game Sigil, and a &quot;Megawad Beast Box&quot; that&#x27;s &quot;individually numbered and signed personally by John Romero and featuring the artwork of Christopher Lovell&quot; (including a signed art print). 

Besides sundry extras including a t-shirt, stickers, and a Sigil-themed coin, it also comes with a pewter statue of John Romero&#x27;s head on a spike...

Shaped like a small space shuttle, &quot;It&#x27;s an itty-bitty spaceplane, not quite 30 feet long and under 10 feet tall,&quot; writes the Washington Post, &quot;with a pair of stubby wings and a rounded, bulldog-like nose.&quot; Space.com says the launch window for the uncrewed vehicle opens Monday at 8:14 p.m. EST.

 
From NBC News:
For the first time, the X-37B will ride into orbit atop a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket. Since its debut more than a decade ago, the X-37B has been a source of intrigue within the space community, mostly owing to the mysterious nature of its activities in low Earth orbit.

Now an anonymous reader shared this report from the Wall Street Journal:


Botanists count potatoes as a vegetable. But should Americans? The U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee has sparked the question... White potatoes, which come in various colors, are classified as &quot;starchy vegetables.&quot; But the committee could uproot potatoes from the vegetable bin and toss them in with a broader category of rice, other grains and carbohydrates as the Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services weigh updates to national diet guidelines for 2025.

The early IDE, written in Assembly, eschewed the use of floppies, instead building the code directly in RAM for an unprecedented performance boost. 
The language demonstrated superior speed, greater convenience, and a more affordable price compared to its competition. Philippe Kahn, Borland&#x27;s CEO who initially conceptualized turning the new language into an all-in-one product, decided to sell the software via mail orders for just $49.95, establishing a market presence for the then-newly founded company.

But it was 30 years ago today that Doom &quot;invented the modern PC games industry, as a place dominated by technologically advanced action shooters,&quot; remembers the Guardian:

In late August 1993, a young programmer named Dave Taylor walked into an office block... The carpets, he discovered, were stained with spilled soda, the ceiling tiles yellowed by water leaks from above. But it was here that a team of five coders, artists and designers were working on arguably the most influential action video game ever made. This was id Software. This was Doom... [W]hen Taylor met id&#x27;s charismatic designer and coder John Romero, he was shown their next project... &quot;There were no critters in it yet,&quot; recalls Taylor of that first demo. &quot;There was n…</span>

 Nikki Haley: What I said was, that social media companies need to show us their algorithms. I also said there are millions of bots on social media right now. They&#x27;re foreign, they&#x27;re Chinese, they&#x27;re Iranian. I will always fight for freedom of speech for Americans; we do not need freedom of speech for Russians and Iranians and Hamas. We need social media companies to go and fight back on all of these bots that are happening. That&#x27;s what I said.

                              <span>A 16-year-old high school student reverse engineered Apple&#x27;s messaging protocol, leading to the launch of an interoperable Android app called &quot;Beeper Mini&quot;. 

But on Friday the Verge reported that &quot;less than a week after its launch, the app started experiencing technical issues when users were suddenly unable to send and receive blue bubble messages.&quot;

Reached for comment, Beeper CEO Eric Migicovsky did not deny that Apple has successfully blocked Beeper Mini. &quot;If it&#x27;s Apple, then I think the biggest question is... if Apple truly cares about the privacy and security of their own iPhone users, why would they stop a service that enables their own users to now send encrypted messages to Android users, rather than using unsecure SMS...?

But most school&#x27;s don&#x27;t teach the mainframe programming language COBOL any more, and &quot;COBOL cowboys&quot; are aging out of the workforce, with replacements in short supply. 

&quot;This is precisely the kind of problem that IBM thinks it can fix with AI.&quot;

IBM&#x27;s approach is fairly straightforward: Rather than relying exclusively on a limited pool of human programmers to solve the problem, it built a generative AI-powered code assistant (watsonx) that helps convert all that dusty old COBOL code to a more modern language, thereby saving coders countless hours of reprogramming. In extremely simplified terms, the process is similar to feeding an e…</span>

                              <span>More than half a century ago, Digital Equipment Corporation released the first of their 16-bit PDP-11 minicomputers, continuing the PDP-11 line until 1997. 

This week long-time Slashdot reader Shayde writes:

I&#x27;ve been working on a 1986 PDP/11 that I basically got as a &quot;barn find&quot; from an estate sale a year ago. The project has absolutely had it&#x27;s ups and downs, as the knowledgebase for these machines is aging quickly. I&#x27;m hoping to restore my own expertise with this build, but it&#x27;s been challenging finding parts, technical details, and just plain information. 

I leaned pretty heavily on the folks at the Vintage Computing Federation, as well as connections I&#x27;ve made in the industry — and made some great progress... Check it out if you&#x27;re keen on retrocomputing and old minicomputers and DEC gear. 

The entire saga is chronicled in three videos titled &quot;Barn Find PDP 11/73 — Will it boot&quot; — part 1, part 2, and this week&#x27;s latest video. &quot;What started as a curiosity has turned into an almost 10-month-long project,&quot; it concludes, creeping up hopefully on the possibility of an awe-struck glimpse at the PDP-11&#x27;s boot sequence (over two minutes long) 

&quot;So cool,&quot; responded Jeremiah Cornelius (Slashdot reader #137) in a comment on the submitted Slashdot story. &quot;I have huge affection for these beasts. I cut my teeth in High School on a DEC PDP11/70 and AT&amp;T SysV, and a little RSTS/E in 1979-82. We switched systems by loading different cakelid platters into the washing-machine drives, and toggling the magenta keys. 

&quot;I&#x27;ve thought about the Blinkenlights 7/10 scale emulator, tha uses an RPi, but I envy you and hope you have fun.&quot;

                              <span>I grew up in a home where music was always playing. My father repaired electronics, so an endless stream of speakers, amplifiers, turntables, and TVs passed through the household. And all of it had to be tested, of course. At max volume. Sometimes at odd hours.
While that was frequently a bit of a nuisance, it did seed a deep appreciation for musical experiences in me. Founded on the fact that music can sound very differently depending on the equipment that conveys it.
But most of my life, I’ve listened to music in one of two more dull settings: Using noise canceling headphones while traveling and in the background while working at a desk. Neither of those two settings are usually conducive to “musical experiences”. Most of the home offices I’ve used haven’t had good acoustics, and there’s…</span>

that means that a new Edition of Rust is on the horizon!
What is an Edition?
You may be aware that a new version of Rust is released every six weeks.
New versions of the language can both add things as well as change things,
but only in backwards-compatible ways, according to Rust&#x27;s
1.0 stability guarantee.
But does that mean that Rust can never make backwards-incompatible changes?
Not quite! This is what an Edition is:
Rust&#x27;s mechanism for introducing backwards-incompatible changes in a backwards-compatible way.
If that sounds like a contradiction,
there are three key properties of Editions that preserve the stability guarantee:
Editions are opt-in;

The researchers go on to say that Microsoft is NOT planning to fix the vulnerability. 

From the article:


While the current report doesn&#x27;t provide technical details or proof-of-concept exploits, Akamai has promised, in the near future, to publish code that implements these attacks called DDSpoof — short for DHCP DNS Spoof. &#x27;We will show how unauthenticated attackers can collect necessary data from DHCP servers, identify vulnerable DNS records, overwrite them, and use that ability to compromise AD domains,&#x27; Akamai security researcher Ori David said. The DHCP attack research builds on earlier work by NETSPI&#x27;s Kevin Roberton, who detailed ways to exploit flaws in DNS zones.

 Linux Magazine: What prompted AlmaLinux to choose ABI over 1:1 compatibility with RHEL? 

benny Vasquez, chair of the AlmaLinux OS Foundation: The short answer is our users. Overwhelmingly, our users made it clear that they chose AlmaLinux for its ease of use, the security and stability that it provides, and the backing of a diverse group of sponsors. All of that together meant that we didn&#x27;t need to lock ourselves into copying RHEL, and we could continue to provide what our users needed. 

Moreover, we needed to consider what our sponsors would be able to help us provide, and how we could best serve th…</span>

Speaking of maintainers, Hohndel brought up the question of &quot;maintainer fatigue and how draining and stressful this role is....&quot; Torvalds replied, &quot;It&#x27;s much easier to find developers; we have a lot of developers. Some people think that you have to be a superdeveloper who can do everything to be a maintainer, but that&#x27;s not actually true....&quot; 

Hohndel commented that the aging of the kernel community is a &quot;double-edged sword.&quot; Torvalds agreed, but he noted that &quot;one of the things I liked about the Rust side of the kernel, was that there was one maintainer who was clearly much younger than most of…</span>

Dubbed &quot;Project Ellmann,&quot; after biographer and literary critic Richard David Ellmann, the idea would be to use LLMs like Gemini to ingest search results, spot patterns in a user&#x27;s photos, create a chatbot and &quot;answer previously impossible questions,&quot; according to a copy of a presentation viewed by CNBC. Ellmann&#x27;s aim, it states, is to be &quot;Your Life Story Teller.&quot;

                              <span>The Go team conducted a survey of Go Developers in August — and has just released the results. Among the findings: &quot;90% of survey respondents saying they felt satisfied while working with Go during the prior year,&quot; while 6% said they were dissastified.

Further, the number of people working with Go continues to increase; we see evidence of this from external research like Stack Overflow&#x27;s Developer Survey (which found 14% of professional developers worked with Go during the past year, a roughly 15% year-over-year increase), as well as analytics for go.dev (which show an 8% rise in visitors year-over-year). Combining this growth with a high satisfaction score is evidence that Go continues to appeal to developers, and suggests that many developers who choose to learn the language feel good a…</span>

Altman — a revered mentor, and avatar of the AI revolution — had been psychologically abusive, the employees alleged, creating pockets of chaos and delays at the artificial-intelligence start-up, according to two people familiar with the board&#x27;s thinking who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal matters. The company leaders, a group that included key figures and people who manage large teams, mentioned Altman&#x27;s allegedly pitting employees against each other in unhealthy ways, the people said.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: Jack Dorsey&#x27;s Block (the company formerly known as Square) announced today that it is releasing its hardware Bitcoin wallet, Bitkey, in 95 countries. However, users can only preorder the device at the moment, with shipping starting in early 2024. The device will cost $150 USD. Block&#x27;s pitch to Bitcoin holders is that using a self-custodial crypto wallet is more secure than keeping their crypto assets in custodial wallets or exchanges.
 
Self-custodial wallets put the onus on users to remember -- or store securely -- passwords or long seed phrases to unlock their accounts. The Proto team at Block, which worked on developing the Bitkey wallet, said that it solved this problem by using a two-of-three authentication mechanism. Two keys lie with the customer: the hardware wallet and a mobile app. Bitkey stores the third key on its server. The company argues that by having access to just one key, it can&#x27;t access or move customers&#x27; Bitcoins.
 
Block said that it uses its server-side key only to authenticate transactions to move Bitcoin when they just have their phone and to recover their account when their device or phone is lost. The company said the server-side key will also be able to handle the scenario when a customer loses both the phone and the hardware wallet. Recovery was recently detailed in a blog post by the company. [...] Block has partnered with crypto exchange Coinbase and the company&#x27;s own Cash App to help people easily buy or transfer (or both) Bitcoins to the hardware wallet. The company said that the ability to transfer Bitcoin from Coinbase and Cash App will be rolled out immediately with other features coming later.

From the report: NotebookLM can already do things like summarize the documents you import into the app, come up with key points, and even answer questions about your note-taking sources. But now, Google is adding a way to transform your notes into other types of documents, too. Once you select all the notes you want to include, NotebookLM will automatically suggest formats, such as an outline or study guide. However, Google notes that you can also tell NotebookLM to transform your notes into a format of your choosing, like an email, script outline, newsletter, and more.
 
Additionally, NotebookLM will now start providing suggested actions based on what you&#x27;re doing in the app. As an example, Google says if you&#x27;re writing a note, NotebookLM may automatically &quot;offer tools to polish or refine your prose, or suggest related ideas from your sources based on what you&#x27;ve just written.&quot; Some other handy features coming to the app include a way to save helpful responses from NotebookLM as notes, share your notes with others, and focus NotebookLM&#x27;s AI on select sources when chatting with it. Google is expanding some of NotebookLM&#x27;s limitations as well. You can now include up to 20 sources in your notebook, each with up to 200,000 words.

                              <span>hackingbear writes: China has started commercial operations at a new generation nuclear reactor that is the first of its kind in the world, state media said on Dec 5. Compared with previous reactors, the fourth generation Shidaowan plant, a modular 200 megawatt (MW) high-temperature, gas-cooled reactor (HTGCR) plant developed jointly by state-run utility Huaneng, Tsinghua University and China National Nuclear Corporation, is designed to use fuel more efficiently and improve its economics, safety and environmental footprint as China turns to nuclear power to try to meet carbon emissions goals.
 
In a related development, Shanghai-based Jiangnan Shipyard has unveiled a design for an innovative new giant container ship -- with a load capacity starting at 24,000 standard containers -- powered by a thorium molten-salt nuclear reactor, an alternative 4th gen design. &quot;The new ship model uses nuclear energy as a clean energy source and adopts an internationally advanced fourth-generation molten salt reactor solution. The proposed design of super-large nuclear container ships will truly achieve &#x27;zero emissions&#x27; during the operation cycle of this type of ship,&quot; the journal Marine Time China said in its official WeChat account.
 
Shipbuilders from Japan, the United States, South Korea, and Europe have come up with similar designs but none of these countries has a modern and reliable operating reactor to make the design a reality. But China has carried on and, earlier this year, got the first thorium-based molten salt reactor, which needs little amount of water to cool down, making it safer and more efficient, up and running in the Gobi desert.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from STAT: The Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved the world&#x27;s first medicine based on CRISPR gene-editing technology, a groundbreaking treatment for sickle cell disease that delivers a potential cure for people born with the chronic and life-shortening blood disorder. The new medicine, called Casgevy, is made by Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics. Its authorization is a scientific triumph for the technology that can efficiently and precisely repair DNA mutations -- ushering in a new era of genetic medicines for inherited diseases.
 
In a clinical trial, Casgevy was shown to eliminate recurrent episodes of debilitating pain caused by sickle cell, which afflicts approximately 100,000 people in the U.S., a vast majority of whom are Black. The therapy, whose scientific name is exa-cel, is described as a potential cure because the genetic fix enabled by CRISPR is designed to last a lifetime, although confirmation will require years of follow-up. The FDA decision comes three weeks after regulators in the U.K. were the first to clear the drug. Approval in the European Union is expected next year. The FDA is also expected to rule on exa-cel as a treatment for beta thalassemia, another inherited blood disorder, by March 30.
 
The FDA on Friday also approved another sickle cell treatment, a gene therapy from Bluebird Bio called Lyfgenia. Patients will now have the option of two cutting-edge therapies that provide potentially curative benefits. Scientists Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna published their first CRISPR paper just over a decade ago. In 2020, the research won the pair a Nobel Prize. Reflecting on the approval of Casgevy, Charpentier told STAT via email that she was &quot;excited and pleased&quot; for what it means for patients and their families.

The Associated Press reports: Under a plan announced Thursday, the government would consider overriding the patent for high-priced drugs that have been developed with the help of taxpayer money and letting competitors make them in hopes of driving down the cost. In a 15-second video released to YouTube on Wednesday night, President Joe Biden promised the move would lower prices. &quot;Today, we&#x27;re taking a very important step toward ending price gouging so you don&#x27;t have to pay more for the medicine you need,&quot; he said.
 
White House officials would not name drugs that might potentially be targeted. The government would consider seizing a patent if a drug is only available to a &quot;narrow set of consumers,&quot; according to the proposal that will be open to public comment for 60 days. Drugmakers are almost certain to challenge the plan in court if it is enacted. [...] The White House also intends to focus more closely on private equity firms that purchase hospitals and health systems, then often whittle them down and sell quickly for a profit. The departments of Justice and Health and Human Services, and the Federal Trade Commission will work to share more data about health system ownership.
 
While only a minority of drugs on the market relied so heavily on taxpayer dollars, the threat of a government &quot;march-in&quot; on patents will make many pharmaceutical companies think twice, said Jing Luo, a professor of medicine at University of Pittsburgh. &quot;If I was a drug company that was trying to license a product that had benefited heavily from taxpayer money, I&#x27;d be very careful about how to price that product,&quot; Luo said. &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t want anyone to take my product away from me.&quot;

                              <span>The role-playing adventure game Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 won game of the year last night at The Game Awards 2023 in Los Angeles. The New York Times reports: It was the crowning achievement for a game based on Dungeons &amp; Dragons that largely stayed under the radar during its six years in development by the Belgian company Larian Studios. But its summer release -- 23 years after its predecessor -- captivated gamers, who celebrated a robust character creator, deep narrative and branching paths that made it seem as though anything was possible in its fictional universe of vampires and elves. Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3, which is available on the PC, the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X|S, also went home with several other awards, including those for best role-playing game, best performance and best multiplayer.
 
The other nominees for game of the year were Alan Wake 2, by Remedy Entertainment; Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man 2, by Insomniac Games; Resident Evil 4, by Capcom; Super Mario Bros. Wonder, by Nintendo; and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, by Nintendo.

Negotiators from the European Parliament and the bloc&#x27;s 27 member countries overcame big differences on controversial points including generative AI and police use of facial recognition surveillance to sign a tentative political agreement for the Artificial Intelligence Act.

                              <span>Slash_Account_Dot writes: The FBI investigated a man who allegedly posed as a police officer in emails and phone calls to trick Verizon to hand over phone data belonging to a specific person that the suspect met on the dating section of porn site xHamster, according to a newly unsealed court record. Despite the relatively unconvincing cover story concocted by the suspect, including the use of a clearly non-government ProtonMail email address, Verizon handed over the victim&#x27;s data to the alleged stalker, including their address and phone logs. The stalker then went on to threaten the victim and ended up driving to where he believed the victim lived while armed with a knife, according to the record.
 
The news is a massive failure by Verizon who did not verify that the data request was fraudulent, and the company potentially put someone&#x27;s safety at risk. The news also highlights the now common use of fraudulent emergency data requests (EDRs) or search warrants in the digital underworld, where criminals pretend to be law enforcement officers, fabricate an urgent scenario such as a kidnapping, and then convince telecoms or tech companies to hand over data that should only be accessible through legitimate law enforcement requests. As 404 Media previously reported, some hackers are using compromised government email accounts for this purpose.

[...]
 
While the number of Chromebooks being sold has dropped since the pandemic, the education market has kept it afloat. In the US, education accounted for 80 percent of Chromebook sales in Q2 this year. IDC estimated that Q2 Chromebook channel sales shrank 1.8 percent to 5.8 million units in that quarter as many customers had refreshed in the previous quarter to avoid a licensing increase in the second half of 2023.

Sperm whales are giants of the deep, with healthy adults having no known predators. Scientists studying their vocalizations have already picked out key elements of their communication, namely clicks, sequences of which are called codas. Now, researchers led by Gasper Beus from the University of California, Berkeley report the discovery that the acoustic properties of these clicks -- for example, pitch -- are &quot;on many levels analogous to human vowels and dipthongs,&quot; which is when one vowel sound morphs into another such as in the word &quot;coin.&quot; The researchers even identify two unique &quot;coda vowels&quot; that…</span>

                              <span>Amazon sued what it called an international ring of thieves who swiped millions of dollars in merchandise from the company through a series of refund scams that included buying products on Amazon and seeking refunds without returning the goods. From a report: An organization called REKK advertised its refund services on social media sites, including Reddit and Discord, and communicated with perpetrators on the messaging app Telegram, Amazon said in a lawsuit filed Thursday in US District Court in the state of Washington. 

The lawsuit names REKK and nearly 30 people from the US, Canada, UK, Greece, Lithuania and the Netherlands as defendants in the scheme, which involved hacking into Amazon&#x27;s internal systems and bribing Amazon employees to approve reimbursements. REKK charged customers, who wanted to get pricey items like MacBook Pro laptops and car tires without paying for them, a commission based on the value of the purchase. &quot;The defendants&#x27; scheme tricks Amazon into processing refunds for products that are never returned; instead of returning the products as promised, defendants keep the product and the refund,&quot; Amazon said in its lawsuit.

                              <span>Record-breaking land and sea temperatures, driven by climate breakdown, will probably cause &quot;unprecedented mass coral bleaching and mortality&quot; throughout 2024, according to a pioneering coral scientist. From a report: The impact of climate change on coral reefs has reached &quot;uncharted territory,&quot; said Prof Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, from the University of Queensland, Australia, leading to concerns that we could be at a &quot;tipping point.&quot; 

The upper ocean is undergoing unmatched changes in conditions, ecosystems and communities that can be traced back to the 1980s, when mass coral bleaching first appeared. In a paper published in the journal Science, US and Australian researchers say that historical data on sea surface temperatures, over four decades, suggests that this year&#x27;s extreme marine heatwaves may be a precursor to a mass bleaching and coral mortality event across the Indo-Pacific in 2024-25. 

Mass coral bleaching happens when delicate corals become stressed due to factors including heat, causing them to lose their brown microbial algae, turning them white. At low stress levels, the algae can return to corals over a few months. But many Caribbean reef areas have recently experienced historically high sea temperatures that began one or two months earlier and lasted longer than usual. Crucially, 2023 is the first year of a potential pair of El Nino years, with the warmest average global surface sea temperature from February to July on record. Since 1997, every instance of these El Nino pairs has led to a global mass coral bleaching event.

                              <span>Apple and its suppliers aim to build more than 50 million iPhones in India annually within the next two to three years, with additional tens of millions of units planned after that, WSJ reported Friday, citing people familiar with the situation. From the report: If the plans are achieved, India would account for a quarter of global iPhone production and take further share toward the end of the decade. China will remain the largest iPhone producer. Apple has gradually boosted its reliance on India in recent years despite challenges including rickety infrastructure and restrictive labor rules that often make doing business harder than in China. Among other issues, labor unions retain clout even in business-friendly states and are pushing back on an effort by companies to get permission for 12-hour work days, which Apple suppliers find helpful during crunch periods. 

Apple and its suppliers, led by Taiwan-based Foxconn Technology Group, generally believe the initial push into India has gone well and are laying the groundwork for a bigger expansion, say people involved in the supply chain. Apple is emblematic of a move among companies worried about overdependence on China to move parts of their supply chains elsewhere, most often to Southeast Asia and South Asia. Diplomatic efforts by the U.S. and its allies to block Beijing&#x27;s access to advanced technology and strengthen ties with New Delhi have accelerated the trend.

                              <span>Tencent revealed one of its most ambitious attempts at a big-budget console game on Friday, betting on a new franchise to fire up fans and help the global expansion of China&#x27;s most valuable company. From a report: Last Sentinel is an open-world adventure game set in a dystopian future Tokyo, developed by Tencent&#x27;s California-based Lightspeed LA studio. The 200-member creative team is headed up by Steve Martin, a quarter-century veteran of the games industry who has worked on marquee games in the genre like Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption. 

The new title, four years in development, is testament to Tencent&#x27;s long-term pursuit of foreign gaming assets and talent. The WeChat operator still relies heavily on domestic game sales in China, but in recent years it&#x27;s amped up efforts to acquire slices of up-and-coming studios from Europe to Japan to complement its ownership of League of Legends creator Riot Games and large stake in Epic Games. Last Sentinel is part of its push to create new intellectual property from scratch. &quot;We have a global gaming community that&#x27;s screaming out that it wants something new. It wants new IPs, it wants new characters. We get to provide that,&quot; Martin, who left Rockstar Games to join Tencent in 2019, said in a video interview before unwrapping his work at The Game Awards in Los Angeles.

                              <span>The biggest UK mobile phone operators could face total damages of $4.15 billion following class-action claims that they allegedly charged 5 million existing customers &quot;loyalty penalties&quot; over a 16-year period. From a report: Claimant lawyers say they filed court documents at the Competition Appeals Tribunal against Vodafone, EE, Three UK and O2 last week. The claims accuse the phone companies of overcharging on as many as 28.2 million contracts by not reducing the amount customers had to pay after their minimum terms expired, despite them having effectively paid off their mobile devices. 

The claim consists of individual lawsuits against each company, with damages sought of up to $1.76 billion from Vodafone, up to $1.38 billion from EE, up to $637.8 million from Three, and up to $322 million from O2. Claimant lawyers at Charles Lyndon, a law firm, estimate that up to 4.8 million people could be affected. If the case is successful, someone who held a contract with one of the mobile operators could receiveÂup to $2,293. The claims are on an &quot;opt-out&quot; basis, which means all qualifying customers will be automatically included in the claim unless they make a choice not to join.

                              <span>WindBourne shares a report: Global carbon emissions from fossil fuels reached record levels again in 2023, as experts warned that the projected rate of warming had not improved over the past two years. The world is on track to have burned more coal, oil and gas in 2023 than it did in 2022, according to a report by the Global Carbon Project, pumping 1.1% more planet-heating carbon dioxide into the atmosphere at a time when emissions must plummet to stop extreme weather from growing more violent. 

The finding comes as world leaders meet in Dubai for the fraught Cop28 climate summit. In a separate report published on Tuesday, Climate Action Tracker (CAT) raised its projections slightly for future warming above the estimates it made at a conference in Glasgow two years ago. As carbon clogs the atmosphere, trapping sunlight and baking the planet, the climate is growing more hostile to human life. The growth in CO2 emissions had slowed substantially over the past decade, the Global Carbon Project found, but the amount emitted each year had continued to rise. It projected that total CO2 emissions in 2023 would reach a record high of 40.9 gigatons. If the world continued to emit CO2 at that rate, the international team of more than 120 scientists found, it would burn through the remaining carbon budget for a half-chance of keeping global heating to 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial temperatures in just seven years. In 15 years, the scientists estimated, the budget for 1.7C would be gone too.

From a report: The machine would collide tiny, point-like particles called muons, which resemble electrons but are more massive. Muons provide more bang for the buck than the protons used in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, and would push the search for new forces and particles deeper than ever into the unknown. The siting of such a project, perhaps at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois, would restore American particle physics to a position of pre-eminence that was ceded to Europe in 1993 when Congress canceled the giant Superconducting…</span>

                              <span>Google Drive recently lost user files, with some reporting missing documents since May 2023. Google said this month that it has posted a fix, but its description of a &quot;syncing issue&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to capture the problem based on user reports of web files disappearing, ArsTechnica notes. 

The company hasn&#x27;t fully explained the cause or its recovery solution, which involves desktop app options and command line file recovery, the report asserts. This opaque handling, along with Google shutting down the Drive user forum that allowed people to share fixes, adds to perception that the company prioritizes PR over assisting users, the report adds.

                              <span>Following a hack that potentially ensnared 6.9 million of its users, 23andMe has updated its terms of service to make it more difficult for you to take the DNA testing kit company to court, and you only have 30 days to opt out. From a report: In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission last week, 23andMe said hackers accessed around 14,000 customer accounts earlier this year by trying login-password combinations exposed in unrelated breaches. It later said hackers had access to 6.9 million accounts due to the interconnected nature of its DNA Relatives feature. 

23andMe has since updated its terms of service in a way that changes how the company resolves disputes with users. Customers were informed via email that &quot;important updates were made to the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration section&quot; on Nov. 30 &quot;to include procedures that will encourage a prompt resolution of any disputes and to streamline arbitration proceedings where multiple similar claims are filed.&quot; Customers have 30 days to let the site know if they disagree with the terms. If they don&#x27;t reach out via email to opt out, the company will consider their silence an agreement to the new terms.

                              <span>Networks spent years telling us that 5G would change everything. But the flashiest use cases are nowhere to be found -- and the race to deploy the tech was costly in more ways than one. From a report: At CES in 2021, 5G was just about everywhere you looked. It was the future of mobile communications that would propel autonomous vehicles, remote surgery, and AR into reality. The low latency! The capacity! It&#x27;ll change everything, we were told. Verizon and AT&amp;T wrote massive checks for new spectrum licenses, and T-Mobile swallowed another network whole because it was very important to make the 5G future happen as quickly as possible and win the race. 

CES 2024 is just around the corner, and while telecom executives were eager to shout about 5G to the rafters just a few years ago, you&#x27;ll pro…</span>

                              <span>Data breaches and ransomware attacks are getting worse. Some 2.6 billion personal records have been exposed in data breaches over the past two years and that number continues to grow, according to a new report commissioned by Apple. From a report: Apple says the escalating intrusions, combined with increases in ransomware means the tech industry needs to move toward greater use of encryption. According to the report, prepared by MIT professor emeritus Stuart E. Madnick: 

1. Data breaches in the US through the first nine months of the year are already 20% higher than for all of 2022.
2. Nearly 70 percent more ransomware attacks were reported through September 2023, than in the first three quarters of 2022.
3. Americans and those in the UK topped the list of those most targeted in ransomware attacks in 2023, followed by Canada and Australia. Those four countries accounted for nearly 70% of reported ransomware attacks.
4. One in four people in the US had their health data exposed in a data breach during the first nine months of 2023.

                              <span>Internet propagandists aligned with Russia have duped at least seven Western celebrities, including Elijah Wood and Priscilla Presley, into recording short videos to support its online information war against Ukraine, according to new security research by Microsoft. From a report: The celebrities look like they were asked to offer words of encouragement -- apparently via the Cameo app -- to someone named &quot;Vladimir&quot; who appears to be struggling with substance abuse, Microsoft said. Instead, these messages were edited, sometimes dressed up with emojis, links and the logos of media outlets and then shared online by the Russia-aligned trolls, the company said. 

The point was to give the appearance that the celebrities were confirming that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was suffering from drug and alcohol problems, false claims that Russia has pushed in the past, according to Microsoft. Russia has denied engaging in disinformation campaigns. In one of the videos, a crudely edited message by Wood to someone named Vladimir references drugs and alcohol, saying: &quot;I just want to make sure that you&#x27;re getting help.&quot; Wood&#x27;s video first surfaced in July, but since then Microsoft researchers have observed six other similar celebrity videos misused in the same way, including clips by &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; actor Dean Norris, John C. McGinley of &quot;Scrubs,&quot; and Kate Flannery of &quot;The Office,&quot; the company said.

                              <span>Tech giants including Google and Facebook parent Meta have dramatically ramped up charitable giving to university campuses over the past several years -- giving them influence over academics studying such critical topics as artificial intelligence, social media and disinformation. From a report: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg alone has donated money to more than 100 university campuses, either through Meta or his personal philanthropy arm, according to new research by the Tech Transparency Project, a nonprofit watchdog group studying the technology industry. Other firms are helping fund academic centers, doling out grants to professors and sitting on advisory boards reserved for donors, researchers told The Post. 

Silicon Valley&#x27;s influence is most apparent among computer science professors at such top-tier schools as Berkeley, University of Toronto, Stanford and MIT. According to a 2021 paper by University of Toronto and Harvard researchers, most tenure-track professors in computer science at those schools whose funding sources could be determined had taken money from the technology industry, including nearly 6 of 10 scholars of AI. The proportion rose further in certain controversial subjects, the study found. Of 33 professors whose funding could be traced who wrote on AI ethics for the top journals Nature and Science, for example, all but one had taken grant money from the tech giants or had worked as their employees or contractors.

From a report: The FCC has been evaluating US-wide broadband deployment progress on a near-annual basis for almost three decades but hasn&#x27;t factored affordability into these regular reviews. The broadband industry is afraid that a thorough examination of prices will lead to more regulation of ISPs. An FCC Notice of Inquiry issued on November 1 proposes to analyze the affordability of Internet service in the agency&#x27;s next congressionally required review of broadband deployment. That could include examining not just monthly prices but also data overage charges and various other fees. 

[...] Cable industry lobby group NCTA-The Internet &amp; Television Association complained in a filing released Monday that the Notice of Inquiry&#x27;s &quot;undue focus on affordability -- or pricing -- is particularly inappropriate.&quot; The group, which represents cable providers such as Comcast and Charter, said that setting an affordability benchmark could lead to rate regulation.

                              <span>Nintendo has cancelled Nintendo Live 2024 Tokyo and postponed other Japanese esports events after persistent threats were made to both staff and spectators. From a report: A Japanese press release, shared by reliable translator Genki on X/Twitter, revealed the &quot;all ages celebration of Nintendo fun,&quot; which took place in the United States for the first time in 2023, has been cancelled and its main esports tournaments postponed. 

Nintendo said its employees have received relentless threats which have also recently targeted spectators, attendees, and staff at Nintendo Live 2024, forcing the cancellation in the interest of safety. It was due to take place from January 20 to 21.

                              <span>The UK accused Russia&#x27;s main intelligence agency of seeking to hack the emails of British politicians and officials in an attempt to interfere in its democratic processes. From a report: &quot;They have been targeting high-profile individuals and entities with a clear intent: using information they obtained to meddle in British politics,&quot; Foreign Office minister Leo Docherty told the House of Commons on Thursday. The intrusions include targeting personal email accounts and impersonation attempts against universities and media organizations, according to Docherty. Civil servants and journalists have also been targeted by Russia&#x27;s Federal Security Service, known as the FSB, he said. 

In November, the UK&#x27;s National Cyber Security Centre warned that Russian and other state-sponsored hackers posed an &quot;enduring and significant threat&quot; to the country. The agency said that Russia was one of the most prolific state actors in cybercrime, and had dedicated substantial resources to conducting hacking operations internationally.

                              <span>A new book argues that the invention of states and corporations has something to teach us about A.I. But perhaps it&#x27;s the other way around. From a report: One of the things that make the machine of the capitalist state work is that some of its powers have been devolved upon other artificial agents -- corporations. Where [David] Runciman (a professor of politics at Cambridge) compares the state to a general A.I., one that exists to serve a variety of functions, corporations have been granted a limited range of autonomy in the form of what might be compared to a narrow A.I., one that exists to fulfill particular purposes that remain beyond the remit or the interests of the sovereign body. 

Corporations can thus be set up in free pursuit of a variety of idiosyncratic human enterprises, but they, too, are robotic insofar as they transcend the constraints and the priorities of their human members. The failure mode of governments is to become &quot;exploitative and corrupt,&quot; Runciman notes. The failure mode of corporations, as extensions of an independent civil society, is that &quot;their independence undoes social stability by allowing those making the money to make their own rules.&quot; 

There is only a &quot;narrow corridor&quot; -- a term Runciman borrows from the economists Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson -- in which the artificial agents balance each other out, and citizens get to enjoy the sense of control that emerges from an atmosphere of freedom and security. The ideal scenario is, in other words, a kludgy equilibrium.

                              <span>Google this week took the wraps off of Gemini, its new flagship generative AI model meant to power a range of products and services including Bard. Google has touted Gemini&#x27;s superior architecture and capabilities, claiming that the model meets or exceeds the performance of other leading gen AI models like OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-4. But the anecdotal evidence suggests otherwise. TechCrunch: The model fails to get basic facts right, like 2023 Oscar winners: Note that Gemini Pro claims incorrectly that Brendan Gleeson won Best Actor last year, not Brendan Fraser -- the actual winner. I tried asking the model the same question and, bizarrely, it gave a different wrong answer. &quot;Navalny,&quot; not &quot;All the Beauty and the Bloodshed,&quot; won Best Documentary Feature last year; &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; won Best International Film; &quot;Women Talking&quot; won Best Adapted Screenplay; and &quot;Pinocchio&quot; won Best Animated Feature Film. That&#x27;s a lot of mistakes. 

Translation doesn&#x27;t appear to be Gemini Pro&#x27;s strong suit, either. What about summarizing news? Surely Gemini Pro, Google Search and Google News at its disposal, can give a recap of something topical? Not necessarily. It seems Gemini Pro is loathe to comment on potentially controversial news topics, instead telling users to... Google it themselves.

The three ads run touch upon a spectrum of negative emotions that will be highly relatable to those who have ever tried to print something at home or work -- sorrow, anger, despair -- and all end with extreme and cathartic human-on-printer violence.

                              <span>In the wake of laying off about 100 of its 1,200 employees, Bungie, the developer behind Destiny, is reportedly grappling with internal challenges and cost-saving measures, amid efforts to maintain some autonomy from Sony. Although Bungie operates as an independent Sony subsidiary, its leadership is seemingly striving to prevent a complete Sony takeover, IGN reports. The company&#x27;s board, split between Bungie and Sony representatives, faces potential dissolution if Bungie fails to meet specific financial goals. This risk has been heightened by the delay of Destiny 2 expansion &quot;The Final Shape&quot; and investments in Marathon, challenging Bungie&#x27;s financial performance. The report adds: Along with the recent layoffs, this has resulted in a massive decay in morale within the company, according to IGN&#x27;s sources, one of whom told us that the mood within the studio has been &quot;soul-crushing&quot; over the last month. And it doesn&#x27;t sound like management is making any significant efforts toward improving the atmosphere, either. According to those still with the company, employee frustration and sadness in the days and weeks following the layoffs was met with a surprising amount of indifference or even outright flippancy or hostility from management. 

Several people we spoke to told us that leaders had reiterated, across multiple meetings, that they couldn&#x27;t guarantee there wouldn&#x27;t be more layoffs, with two specifically confirming previous reports that chief people officer Holly Barbacovi outright stating that layoffs were a &quot;lever&quot; the company would pull again.

                              <span>What&#x27;s next for Windows? Microsoft plans next-gen Windows AI release in 2024, plus details on recent changes to the Windows roadmap. From a report: According to my sources, the new Windows bosses are now returning to an annual release cycle for major versions of the Windows platform, meaning Windows is going back to having just one big feature update a year instead of multiple smaller ones throughout. Microsoft may still use Moment updates sparingly, but they will no longer be the primary delivery vehicle for new features going forward. 

These changes are said to take effect after Hudson Valley launches in 2024, so I&#x27;m still expecting at least one more Moment update for the current version of Windows 11, which sources say will ship in the February or March time frame early next year. [...] According to my sources, Microsoft&#x27;s blockbuster new feature will be the introduction of an AI-powered Windows Shell, enhanced with an &quot;advanced Copilot,&quot; that&#x27;s able to constantly work in the background to enhance search, jumpstart projects or workflows, understand context, and much more. 

Sources say these AI features will be &quot;groundbreaking.&quot; The company is working on a new history/timeline feature that will let users scroll back in time through all the apps and websites that Copilot has remembered, which can be filtered based on a user&#x27;s specific search criteria. For example, you could type &quot;FY24 earnings&quot; and every instance where that term was on-screen will reappear for you to see and open. AI will also enhance search in Windows, with the ability to use natural language to find things that you&#x27;ve previously opened or seen on your PC.

                              <span>After staving off collapse by cutting costs, many young tech companies are out of options, fueling a cash bonfire. From a report: WeWork raised more than $11 billion in funding as a private company. Olive AI, a health care start-up, gathered $852 million. Convoy, a freight start-up, raised $900 million. And Veev, a home construction start-up, amassed $647 million. In the last six weeks, they all filed for bankruptcy or shut down. They are the most recent failures in a tech start-up collapse that investors say is only beginning. After staving off mass failure by cutting costs over the past two years, many once-promising tech companies are now on the verge of running out of time and money. They face a harsh reality: Investors are no longer interested in promises. Rather, venture capital firm…</span>

                              <span>India wants to be the voice of the global south in the negotiations. But can the world&#x27;s most populous nation cut its massive coal use? From a report: India is pitching itself as a leader of the global south at the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28), under way in Dubai. During his opening speech at the meeting, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi issued a sharp rebuke to wealthy nations: &quot;A small section of mankind has exploited nature indiscriminately. But the whole of humanity is paying its price, especially the residents of the global south.&quot; But India -- now the world&#x27;s most populous nation -- relies heavily on coal to meet its energy needs, and faces a difficult path to cutting its emissions to net zero. The country&#x27;s priority remains reducing poverty -- which India…</span>
