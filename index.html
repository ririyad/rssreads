                              <span>We&#x27;re fortunate we get to make things. But sometimes something sticks around long enough that we have the good fortune to have a chance to remake it.
When evaluating a redesign, your first instinct is to compare the new design to the old design. But don’t do that.
The first step is to understand what you’re evaluating. If you just put the new design up against the old design, and compare the two, the old design will strongly influence your evaluation of the new design.

This is OK if nothing’s changed since the original design was launched. But it’s likely a lot has changed since then – especially if many months or years have passed.

Maybe there are new insights, maybe there’s new data, maybe there’s a new goal, maybe there’s a new hunch, or maybe there’s a whole new strategy at play. Maybe “make it readable” was important 3 years ago, while “help people see things they couldn’t see before” is more important today. Or maybe it’s both now.

But if the old design sets the tone about what’s important, then you may be losing out on an opportunity to make a significant leap forward. A design should never set the tone – ideas should set the tone. Ideas are independent of the design.

So, when evaluating a redesign you have to know what you’re looking for, not just what you’re looking at. How the new design compares to the old may be the least important thing to consider.

It’s a subtle thing, but it can make all the difference.

                              <span>Last week, we successfully pulled off our biggest cloud exit yet for Basecamp Classic. This is the original app that started it all for us from way back in 2004. And now, after a couple of years running on AWS, it&#x27;s back on our own hardware, using MRSK, and holy smokes is it fast! Just look at these charts:
  
      
        

  
The median request now runs in just 19ms, compared to 67ms before. The mean request in 95ms vs 138ms. The median query time has dropped in half (which adds up when you do a lot of queries per request!). Basecamp Classic was no slouch in the cloud before, but now 95% of all requests are below that magic 300ms cut-off.
(But take these comparisons with a pound of salt. It&#x27;s not exactly a clean-room, scientific test. Just a peak at the reality of leaving a fine-tuned …</span>

                              <span>One of the straightest paths to purpose in life is to take responsibility for something (or someone). Becoming a person whose presence and competence benefits others. For both your sake and theirs.
Jordan Peterson calls this the &quot;meaningful burden&quot; in 12 Rules for Life, and downright posits it as an antidote to depression. Echoing Victor Frankl&#x27;s famous quote &quot;he who has a why to live for can bear almost any how&quot; from Man&#x27;s Search for Meaning.
There&#x27;s something inherently counterintuitive about this notion that people who feel overwhelmed by life, or lost in its endless possibilities, might not need a lighter load, but a more meaningful burden instead. It reminds me of the version of burnout that stems not from overwork, but from under-purpose. Sometimes, the answer to &quot;it&#x27;s just all too m…</span>

 Today, I might have an answer with the incredible story of Yann Collet.
 Yann was a project manager who went from being burnt out on corporate life to becoming one of the most sought-after developers in the world. What happens when you build something so impressive and valuable that it essentially becomes invisible?
 And how do you do that when your day job is mainly organizing spreadsheets and keeping timelines on track?
 Yann built LZ4 and ZStandard - two of the world&#x27;s fastest compression algorithms that have transformed databases, operating systems, file systems, and much more. We&#x27;ll go back in time to Yann&#x27;s initial steps with programming, his game-changing discoveries along the way and how his devotion to data compression hobby led him to create something that saves billions of dollars worldwide.

It introduced a bug that caused Cargo to fail to build packages that use a particular, but very common, dependency setup. The change nearly made its way into the next nightly release. If it had, it would have rendered any of the 30k crates with serde_derive as a dependency (one of the most popular crate on crates.io) unbuildable for anyone using the resulting nightly release.
Following this incident, the Cargo team went through a postmortem analysis, as is appropriate for incidents with (a potential for) broad blast-radius or otherwise significant impact. This time around, we followed a particular structured postmortem template in the hopes that it might make the resulting write-up more thorough, insig…</span>

                              <span>Founder &amp; CEO is a common title, especially in tech.
It happens to be my title too.
I&#x27;ve come to believe it&#x27;s an impossible title. You&#x27;re either CEO, or you&#x27;re Founder. You can&#x27;t hold both full-time jobs.
And unless your company is probably 100+, CEO isn&#x27;t really a job anyway. It&#x27;s more of a role someone needs to play occasionally.
There simply aren&#x27;t that many big picture things or decisions to &quot;execute&quot; day in and day out — or even week in and week out — to make it a true full time job. A role yes, a hat to wear yes, a full-time job at a smallish company? No. It&#x27;s part-time at best, quarter-time even better.
Further, the fundamental responsibilities of Founders and CEOs are at odds. Having them mashed up in the same title is as ridiculous as having someone who&#x27;s a &quot;CTO &amp; Chief Luddite&quot;.

Take gun deaths, for example. Americans own more guns per capita than any other country in the world, and by a huge margin too. Those guns are used by people to kill others and themselves. But while the homicide rate is up recently, it&#x27;s still below where it was in the 90s or even the 70s. Suicides by gun haven&#x27;t really swung that much either.

                              <span>The rustup working group is happy to announce the release of rustup version 1.26.0. Rustup is the recommended tool to install Rust, a programming language that is empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.
If you have a previous version of rustup installed, getting rustup 1.26.0 is as easy as stopping any programs which may be using Rustup (e.g. closing your IDE) and running:

                              <span>The recent and rapid advance of AI has rightfully giving many in software real doubts about the future of their profession. I&#x27;d probably still wager that the fears are overstated – that we also got prematurely euphoric about the imminent prospects of self-driving cars – and that AI generating code is different from it evolving existing systems. But I wouldn&#x27;t want to bet the house on it. This might just be The Big One.
That uncertainty, whether we truly are on the cusp of a total transformation, is a surprising novelty to me, despite thirty years in software. We&#x27;ve been through so many breathless predictions about how this or that advancement in software would simply &quot;Change. Everything. Forever.&quot; that a certain pessimism would be perfectly reasonable.

                              <span>Yesterday I was speaking to a university class and, as it usually does, a question about innovation came up.


&quot;How do you stay innovative? How do you encourage innovative thinking at work?&quot;


My answer: You don&#x27;t stay innovative and you don&#x27;t encourage innovative thinking at work.


WHAT? Yes.


Innovation should almost never happen. It&#x27;s incredibly rare. It mostly happens by accident, not by intention. It&#x27;s wonderful when it does, but you merely fluctuate in and out of it, it&#x27;s not steady state.


Work is mostly mundane. It&#x27;s mostly maintenance. It&#x27;s mostly local improvement and iteration. Work is mostly... Work. Any innovation is an outlier, nearly a rounding error.


Even the most innovative projects or products are full of rote, prosaic stuff that still needs building. The poetic magic may be in the 5%, but the bulk of the work is in the other 95.


So I told the students they&#x27;d better get used to that. Work is not often very exciting, but it can absolutely be fulfilling. And you can be excited about that. But if you&#x27;re expecting breakthroughs all the time, riff sessions that constantly lead somewhere new, or brainstorms that shoot lightning, you&#x27;re going to be disappointed.


Yes innovation happens. Occasionally. Being happy at work is about finding challenge, reward, growth, and creative and intellectual stimulation in everything else.


Now... back to this new product we&#x27;re building.

     example of how he uses ChatGPT to help him code in a self-testing

     (chain of thought prompting). His prompt also asks for an implementation
     plan rather than code (general knowledge prompting). Once he has the plan
     he uses it to refine the implementation and generate useful sections of
     code.

                              <span>A note on the Trademark Policy Draft
For the past eight months, the Rust Foundation Project Directors have been working with the informal Trademark Working Group and the Foundation staff to draft an updated policy and FAQ for the Rust trademark. We&#x27;d like to provide some context around this work and address the community response to the feedback form for the recently circulated draft.
Background
Back when the Rust Foundation was created, one of the first things to happen was Mozilla transferring its ownership of the Rust trademark to the newly created foundation. An update to the existing policy was needed, and project leadership planned for this to be done together with the Foundation.
Since we wanted to incorporate community input to this policy and make it accessible as possible, the bo…</span>

                              <span>A friend of mine called. He was overwhelmed by a home renovation project that ballooned in size.
What started as a simple kitchen countertop replacement turned into more work in the kitchen, new lighting throughout the house, a master bathroom gut rehab, and new flooring in every room.
It became too much. He felt like he was sinking and he couldn&#x27;t find a grip to grab to prevent the downward spiral.
This was his first time managing so many things at once, along with living with the mess that&#x27;s inherent to demolition. Calm was hard to find, and clarity had left the building.
With genuine concern distorting his voice, he said &quot;I&#x27;m in a bad spot. What do I do?&quot;
So I asked him to give me a rundown on what was finished, and what was in progress. Essentially, step one is simply taking inventory.…</span>

                              <span>Our 2023 marketing campaign for Basecamp kicked off on a ton of different channels at once. Web ads, search ads, podcast ads, and TV ads all blasted the message of JUST LET ME DO MY JOB. Our flagship commercial was a hit with the audience and the critics. But our attempt at out-of-home advertising, with billboards all over Boston, was a bust at a $300,000 cost.


    
      
        

    
      
        

    
      
        

  

That&#x27;s advertisement! It&#x27;s hard to know what&#x27;s going to work unless you give it a go. And since we&#x27;re fighting competitors with one hand behind our back by refusing to use privacy-invasive ads targeted on personal data, we thought it was worth trying some more conventional channels, like billboards. But at least for software like Basecamp, it&#x27;s clear that isn&#x27;t likely to work.
It&#x27;s not that it did nothing. We did have 98 billboards all over Boston for about a month. But the effect was only barely measurable:
  
      
        

  
As you can see, we were at the top end of the predicted normal range, or even slightly above. But even with that, we ended up spending thousands of dollars on every attributable trial signup. Way outside the realm of anything we could claim a return on, even if you factored in a fair bit of long-run brand awareness.
I will say that it felt pretty cool to see the irreverent Basecamp marketing messages appear on building-hugging billboards. There was an emotionally gratifying return on the investment. And perhaps that explains why it used to be common to see business software advertised in places like San Francisco where a lot of executives of such companies could feel good about seeing them. There&#x27;s something gratifying about being in the real world like this.
But yeah, it didn&#x27;t work. We won&#x27;t be doing that again. But we&#x27;ll always have the pictures 😄</span>

Way to make an entrance!
This new conference will kick off at quite a momentous occasion, too: Celebrating the 20th anniversary of Ruby on Rails!

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a long time since I last saw a physical piece of hardware used to run our services at 37signals. I vaguely remember doing a tour of our Chicago data center over a decade ago, but somewhere along the line, I just lost interest in the iron itself. Now the interest is back, because hardware is fun again, so let me share my excitement with you!
  
      
        

  
These are the two pallets that showed up in our Chicago data center recently. The same day that an identical set arrived in Ashburn, Virginia for our second data center. In total, we received twenty R7625 Dell servers that&#x27;ll power the bulk of our cloud exit. It&#x27;s a staggering amount of computing power in a shockingly small footprint.
Here&#x27;s a diagram of our four cabinets in Chicago (we have another four in Ashburn). As …</span>

Arlo has been instrumental in bringing Cargo&#x27;s new sparse registry support to fruition, which significantly improves registry performance. He has been involved with registry design and authentication discussions, and has been closely working with the team over the past year.
Scott has been very active in the past year, working on various parts of Cargo, namely implementing workspace inheritance. Since then, he has been helping with maintenance and designing new features.
With their help we now have capacity to start thinking about how feature development should be done moving forward. We are still in early discussions of processes for matching feature development with reviewer capacity, and will share more in the future. Thanks to Arlo and Scott for their help, and we are very much looking forward to having them as a part of the team!</span>

                              <span>Tim Urban&#x27;s new book What&#x27;s Our Problem? offers an excellent analysis of the current American political malaise. It breaks down the history of first how the Republican party got overrun by low-rung thinking from the mid-90s forward, then how equally low-rung thinking got the other side in the past decade or so. It&#x27;s a light, humorous recap of modern American political history. I highly recommend it.
It&#x27;s central contribution is adding a second dimension to the political spectrum. What we&#x27;re dealing with is not just far-left, left, center, right, far-right. That spectrum is about contesting &quot;what is&quot; and &quot;what ought to be&quot;. Our current problem is not so much disagreeing about those two central elements. All democracies will and should continue to do that. It&#x27;s how that disagreements manifes…</span>

                              <span>The product development process encompasses many moments. Moments of novel breakthrough, moments of mundane maintenance, and everything in between. But some of the most rewarding moments consistently come from making something simply useful.
Yesterday we shipped a feature in HEY called &quot;Reply to Everyone&quot; that was exactly that: Simply useful.
One of the things that makes something simply useful is a clear line from problem to solution. From hassle to effortlessness. From a lot of time to nearly no time at all. From creating work to eliminating work.
So let&#x27;s trace Reply to Everyone back to the initial germ of the idea.
It all started with frustration. This is a great place to start any feature. In fact, the closer you start to frustration, the more fuel you have to burn up the problem.

                              <span>Recent discussions with my colleagues showed that many software teams
     still run into trouble because they pack too much planned
     work into their iterations. Teams will usually run better when they have
     deliberate Slack, as it allows their delivery to be more predictable and
     gives them time to improve their environment.
While writing that bliki post, I also defined two styles of task
     planning in agile projects. Timeboxed Iterations are used to
     break up work into small chunks with a regular cadence to reassess the work
     and future plans. Using a little ceremony around allocating work to
     iterations helps make problems visible so that they can be dealt with
     properly. Continuous Flow
     dispenses with that ceremony, so skilled teams often prefer it.
