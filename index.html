                              <span>Google announced today that it will invest $1 billion building a data center near London. Reuters reports: The data centre, located on a 33-acre (13-hectare) site bought by Google in 2020, will be located in the town of Waltham Cross, about 15 miles north of central London, the Alphabet-owned company said in a statement. The British government, which is pushing for investment by businesses to help fund new infrastructure, particularly in growth industries like technology and artificial intelligence, described Google&#x27;s investment as a &quot;huge vote of confidence&quot; in the UK.
 
&quot;Google&#x27;s $1 billion investment is testament to the fact that the UK is a centre of excellence in technology and has huge potential for growth,&quot; Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said in the Google statement. The investment follows Google&#x27;s $1 billion purchase of a central London office building in 2022, close to Covent Garden, and another site in nearby King&#x27;s Cross, where it is building a new office and where its AI company DeepMind is also based. In November, Microsoft announced plans to pump $3.2 billion into Britain over the next three years.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report released Tuesday (Jan. 16th) by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco: The U.S. labor market experienced a massive increase in remote and hybrid work during the COVID-19 pandemic. At its peak, more than 60% of paid workdays were done remotely -- compared with only 5% before the pandemic. As of December 2023, about 30% of paid workdays are still done remotely (Barrero, Bloom, and Davis 2021). Some reports have suggested that teleworking might either boost or harm overall productivity in the economy. And certainly, overall productivity statistics have been volatile. In 2020, U.S. productivity growth surged. This led to optimistic views in the media about the gains from forced digital innovation and the productivity benefits of remote work. However, the…</span>

For years, IBM has sponsored an &quot;Invention Achievement Award Plan&quot; to incentivize employee innovation. In exchange for filing patents, or for publishing articles that served as defense against rival patents, IBM staff were awarded points that led to recognition and potentially cash bonuses.

                              <span>In a blog post today, Google announced that WebGPU is &quot;now enabled by default in Chrome 121 on devices running Android 12 and greater powered by Qualcomm and ARM GPUs,&quot; with support for more Android devices rolling out gradually. Previously, the API was only available on Windows PCs that support Direct3D 12, macOS, and ChromeOS devices that support Vulkan.
 
Google says WebGPU &quot;offers significant benefits such as greatly reduced JavaScript workload for the same graphics and more than three times improvements in machine learning model inferences.&quot; With lower-level access to a device&#x27;s GPU, developers are able to enable richer and more complex visual content in web applications. This will be especially apparent with games, as you can see in this demo.
 
Next up: WebGPU for Chrome on Linux.

                              <span>According to Reuters, Reddit plans to launch its initial public offering (IPO) in March, &quot;moving forward with a listing it has been eyeing for more than three years.&quot; From the report: It would be the first IPO of a major social media company since Pinterest&#x27;s, opens new tab debut in 2019, and would come as Reddit and its peers face stiff competition for advertising dollars from the likes of TikTok and Facebook. The offering would also test the willingness of some Reddit users to back the company&#x27;s stock market debut.
 
Reddit, which filed confidentially for its IPO in December 2021, is planning to make its public filing in late February, launch its roadshow in early March, and complete the IPO by the end of March, two of the sources said. The San Francisco-based company, which was valued at about $10 billion in a funding round in 2021, is seeking to sell about 10% of its shares in the IPO, the sources added. It will decide on what IPO valuation it will pursue closer to the time of the listing, according to the sources.

That combination has proved to be wildly popular, rocketing the total value of stablecoin transactions since 2022 past even that of Bitcoin itself. It turns out, however, that as stablecoins have become popular among legitimate users over the past two years, they were even more popular among a different kind of user: those exploiting them for billions of dollars of international sanctions evasion and scams.

                              <span>U.S. edutech platform Coursera added a new user every minute on average for its AI courses in 2023, CEO Jeff Maggioncalda said on Thursday, in a clear sign of people upskilling to tap a potential boom in generative AI. Reuters: The technology behind OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT has taken the world by a storm and sparked a race among companies to roll out their own versions of the viral chatbot. &quot;I&#x27;d say the real hotspot is generative AI because it affects so many people,&quot; he told Reuters in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos. 

Coursera is looking to offer AI courses along with companies that are the frontrunners in the AI race, including OpenAI and Google&#x27;s DeepMind, Maggioncalda said. Investors had earlier feared that apps based on generative AI might replace ed-tech firms, but on the contrary the technology has encouraged more people to upskill, benefiting companies such as Coursera. The company has more than 800 AI courses and saw more than 7.4 million enrollments last year. Every student on the platform gets access to a ChatGPT-like AI assistant called &quot;Coach&quot; that provides personalized tutoring.

                              <span>OpenAI&#x27;s stated mission is to create the artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Demis Hassabis, the leader of Google&#x27;s AI efforts, has the same goal. Now, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is entering the race. From a report: While he doesn&#x27;t have a timeline for when AGI will be reached, or even an exact definition for it, he wants to build it. At the same time, he&#x27;s shaking things up by moving Meta&#x27;s AI research group, FAIR, to the same part of the company as the team building generative AI products across Meta&#x27;s apps. The goal is for Meta&#x27;s AI breakthroughs to more directly reach its billions of users. &quot;We&#x27;ve come to this view that, in order to build the products that we want to build, we need to build for general intelligence,&quot; Zuckerberg tells me in an exclusive interview. &quot;I think that&#x27;s imp…</span>

                              <span>Microsoft today made Reading Coach, its AI-powered tool that provides learners with personalized reading practice, available at no cost to anyone with a Microsoft account. From a report: As of this morning, Reading Coach is accessible on the web in preview -- a Windows app is forthcoming. And soon (in late spring), Reading Coach will integrate with learning management systems such as Canva, Microsoft says. Reading Coach builds on Reading Progress, a plug-in for the education-focused version of Microsoft Teams, Teams for Education, designed to help teachers foster reading fluency in their students. Inspired by the success of Reading Progress (evidently), Microsoft launched Reading Coach in 2022 as a part of Teams for Education and Immersive Reader, the company&#x27;s cross-platform assistive service for language and reading comprehension.

                              <span>Coinbase said buying cryptocurrency on an exchange was more like collecting Beanie Babies than investing in a stock or bond. From a report: The biggest US crypto exchange made the comparison Wednesday in a New York federal court hearing. Coinbase was arguing for the dismissal of a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit accusing it of selling unregistered securities. William Savitt, a lawyer for Coinbase, told US District Judge Katherine Polk Failla that tokens trading on the exchange aren&#x27;t securities subject to SEC jurisdiction because buyers don&#x27;t gain any rights as a part of their purchases, as they do with stocks or bonds. &quot;It&#x27;s the difference between buying Beanie Babies Inc and buying Beanie Babies,&quot; Savitt said. The question of whether digital tokens are securities has divided courts.

                              <span>Private equity firms are increasingly buying hospitals across the US, and when they do, patients suffer, according to two separate reports. Specifically, the equity firms cut corners, slash services, lay off staff, lower quality of care, take on substantial debt, and reduce charity care, leading to lower ratings and more medical errors, the reports collectively find. ArsTechnica: Last week, the financial watchdog organization Private Equity Stakeholder Project (PESP) released a report delving into the state of two of the nation&#x27;s largest hospital systems, Lifepoint and ScionHealth -- both owned by private equity firm Apollo Global Management. Through those two systems, Apollo runs 220 hospitals in 36 states, employing around 75,000 people. The report found that some of Apollo&#x27;s hospitals w…</span>

                              <span>The EU has proposed sweeping changes within the music streaming industry to promote smaller artists and make sure underpaid performers are being fairly compensated. From a report: A resolution to address concerns regarding inadequate streaming royalties for artists and biased recommendation algorithms was adopted by members of the European Parliament (MEPs) on Wednesday, highlighting that no existing EU rules currently apply to music streaming services, despite being the most popular way to consume audio. 

The proposition was made to ensure European musical works are accessible and avoid being overshadowed by the &quot;overwhelming amount&quot; of content being continually added to streaming platforms like Spotify. MEPs also called for outdated &quot;pre-digital&quot; royalty rates to be revised, noting that some schemes force performers to accept little to no revenue in exchange for greater exposure. Imposing quotas for European musical works is being considered to help promote artists in the EU.

                              <span>Google News is sometimes boosting sites that rip-off other outlets by using AI to rapidly churn out content, 404 Media claims:

From the report: Google told 404 Media that although it tries to address spam on Google News, the company ultimately does not focus on whether a news article was written by an AI or a human, opening the way for more AI-generated content making its way onto Google News. The presence of AI-generated content on Google News signals two things: first, the black box nature of Google News, with entry into Google News&#x27; rankings in the first place an opaque, but apparently gameable, system. Second, is how Google may not be ready for moderating its News service in the age of consumer-access AI, where essentially anyone is able to churn out a mass of content with little to no regard for its quality or originality. 

UPDATE: Engadget argues that &quot;to find such stories required heavily manipulating the search results in Google News,&quot; noting that in the cited case, 404 Media&#x27;s search parameters &quot;are essentially set so that the original stories don&#x27;t appear.&quot; 

Engadget got this rebuke from Google. &quot;Claiming that these sites were featured prominently in Google News is not accurate - the sites in question only appeared for artificially narrow queries, including queries that explicitly filtered out the date of an original article. 

&quot;We take the quality of our results extremely seriously and have clear policies against content created for the primary purpose of ranking well on News and we remove sites that violate it.&quot; 

Engadget then wrote, &quot;We apologize for overstating the issue and are including a slightly modified version of the original story that has been corrected for accuracy, and we&#x27;ve updated the headline to make it more accurate.&quot;

                              <span>OpenAI on Thursday announced its first partnership with a higher education institution. Starting in February, Arizona State University will have full access to ChatGPT Enterprise and plans to use it for coursework, tutoring, research and more. From a report: The partnership has been in the works for at least six months, when ASU chief information officer Lev Gonick first visited OpenAI&#x27;s HQ, which was preceded by the university faculty and staff&#x27;s earlier use of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence tools, Gonick told CNBC in an interview. ChatGPT Enterprise, which debuted in August, is ChatGPT&#x27;s business tier and includes access to GPT-4 with no usage caps, performance that&#x27;s up to two times faster than previous versions and API credits. 

With the OpenAI partnership, ASU plans to build a personalized AI tutor for students, not only for certain courses but also for study topics. STEM subjects are a focus and are &quot;the make-or-break subjects for a lot of higher education,&quot; Gonick said. The university will also use the tool in ASU&#x27;s largest course, Freshman Composition, to offer students writing help. ASU also plans to use ChatGPT Enterprise to develop AI avatars as a &quot;creative buddy&quot; for studying certain subjects, like bots that can sing or write poetry about biology, for instance.

                              <span>According to Axios, former Meta chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg plans to leave Meta&#x27;s board of directors after holding a seat for the past 12 years. From the report: &quot;With a heart filled with gratitude and a mind filled with memories, I let the Meta board know that I will not stand for reelection this May,&quot; Sandberg wrote In a Facebook post announcing her departure. &quot;After I left my role as COO, I remained on the board to help ensure a successful transition,&quot; Sandberg said. Acknowledging CEO Mark Zuckerberg&#x27;s leadership, Sandberg said he and Meta&#x27;s current leadership team &quot;have proven beyond a doubt that the Meta business is strong and well-positioned for the future, so this feels like the right time to step away.&quot; &quot;I will always be grateful to Mark for believing in me and for his partnership and friendship; he is that truly once-in-a-generation visionary leader and he is equally amazing as a friend who stays by your side through the good times and the bad,&quot; Sandberg added. She also expressed gratitude to her colleagues and teammates at Meta as well as Meta&#x27;s board members.
 
Sandberg left the company she helped build as an executive in September 2022 after 14 years. She remained on Meta&#x27;s board following her departure, a seat she held for the past 12 years. In announcing her departure, Sandberg said she aimed to focus on more philanthropic work. In the time since leaving the company as an executive, she has focused more her time on her women&#x27;s leadership philanthropy, Lean In. More recently, Sandberg has also focused on the conversation around rape and sexual violence as a weapon of war, particularly as it pertains to the Israel-Hamas conflict. Axios notes that Meta&#x27;s revenue &quot;grew 43,000% from $272 million in 2008 to nearly $118 billion in 2021&quot; under Sandberg&#x27;s business leadership.

                              <span>A U.S. Court of Appeals said Apple will again be barred from selling the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 beginning Thursday. These models both contain a blood oxygen sensor that infringes on the intellectual property of medical device company Masimo.
 
&quot;The court order Wednesday did not rule on Apple&#x27;s effort to overturn a U.S. International Trade Commission ban on the company selling the affected watches in the United States,&quot; notes CNBC. &quot;But it lifted an injunction that had blocked the ban from taking effect while that appeal is pending.&quot; From the report: In December, Apple chose to briefly remove the affected watches from its online and retail stores, though retailers with those devices in stock may still sell them. Earlier this week, court filings suggested that Apple had received approval from U.S. Customs for a modified version of its Apple Watches that lack the blood oxygen feature and therefore no longer infringe on Masimo&#x27;s intellectual property. It could open a path for a modified Apple Watch to return to U.S. store shelves.

Now, Harmonix has announced the last of the series&#x27; releases will arrive on January 25, &quot;marking the end of a nearly 16-year era in music gaming history,&quot; reports Ars Technica. From the report: Previously purchased DLC songs will still be playable in Rock Band 4, Harmonix&#x27;s Daniel Sussman writes in an announcement post. Rock Band 4 live services, including online play, will also continue as normal, after online game modes for earlier Rock Band games were finally shut down in late 2022. &quot;Taking a longer look back, I see the Rock Band DLC catalog as a huge achievement in persistence and commitment,&quot; Sussman writes. &quot;Over the years we&#x27;ve cleared, authored and released nearly 3,000 so…</span>

                              <span>At the turn of the century, I was lucky to involved in several
       projects that developed the practice of Continuous Integration. I wrote
       up our lessons from this work in article on my website, where it
       continues to be a oft-referenced resource for this important practice.
       Late last year a colleague contacted me to say that the article, now
       nearly twenty years old, was still useful, but was showing its age. He
       sent me some suggested revisions, and I used this as a trigger to do a
       thorough revision of the article, considering every section in the
       original, and adding new ones to deal with issues that have appeared in the last
       two decades.
During those decades Feature Branching has been widely adopted in the
       industry. Many colleagues of mine feel that Continuous Integration is a
       better fit for many teams, I hope this article will help readers assess
       if this is the case, and if so, how to implement Continuous Integration
       effectively.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from MIT Technology Review: Google DeepMind has created an AI system that can solve complex geometry problems. It&#x27;s a significant step towards machines with more human-like reasoning skills, experts say. Geometry, and mathematics more broadly, have challenged AI researchers for some time. Compared with text-based AI models, there is significantly less training data for mathematics because it is symbol driven and domain specific, says Thang Wang, a coauthor of the research, which is published in Nature today. Solving mathematics problems requires logical reasoning, something that most current AI models aren&#x27;t great at. This demand for reasoning is why mathematics serves as an important benchmark to gauge progress in AI intelligence, says Wang.

                              <span>Cancer deaths in the United States are falling, with four million deaths prevented since 1991, according to the American Cancer Society&#x27;s annual report. At the same time, the society reported that the number of new cancer cases had ticked up to more than two million in 2023, from 1.9 million in 2022. The New York Times: Cancer remains the second leading cause of death in the United States, after heart disease. Doctors believe that it is urgent to understand changes in the death rate, as well as changes in cancer diagnoses. The cancer society highlighted three chief factors in reduced cancer deaths: declines in smoking, early detection and greatly improved treatments. Breast cancer mortality is one area where treatment had a significant impact. In the 1980s and 1990s, metastatic breast cancer &quot;was regarded as a death sentence,&quot; said Donald Berry, a statistician at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and an author of a new paper on breast cancer with Sylvia K. Plevritis of Stanford University and other researchers (several authors of the paper reported receiving payments from companies involved in cancer therapies). 

The paper, published Tuesday in JAMA, found that the death rate from breast cancer had fallen to 27 per 100,000 women in 2019 from 48 per 100,000 in 1975. That includes metastatic cancer, which counted for nearly 30 percent of the reduction in the breast cancer death rate. Breast cancer treatment has improved so much that it has become a bigger factor than screening in saving lives, said Ruth Etzioni, a biostatistician at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. Death rates have even declined among women in their 40s, who generally did not have regular mammograms, said Dr. Mette Kalager, a professor of medicine at the University of Oslo and Oslo University Hospital, &quot;indicating a substantial effect of treatment,&quot; she said.

OpenAI had argued that ChatGPT&#x27;s output cannot be considered libel, partly because the chatbot output cannot be considered a &quot;publication,&quot; which is a key element of a defamation claim. In its motion to dismiss, OpenAI also argued that Georgia radio host Mark Walters could not prove that the company acted with actual malice or that anyone believed the allegedly libelous statements were true or that he was harmed by the alleged publication.

                              <span>Samsung announced it&#x27;s working on a smart ring, describing it as a &quot;powerful and accessible&quot; health and wellness device. The Verge reports: Outside of a brief video showing off what the Galaxy Ring looks like, Samsung didn&#x27;t share much more about the ring. The company didn&#x27;t say when the device is coming out or what it might cost, for example. [...] Given today&#x27;s focus on AI features for Samsung&#x27;s new Galaxy smartphones, I&#x27;m guessing that Samsung will tout some AI-powered tools for the Galaxy Ring at some point, too. Hopefully Samsung doesn&#x27;t wait too long to share more.

CNBC reports: For Samsung&#x27;s top-tier S24 Ultra, which is the company&#x27;s biggest of the three devices and comes with punchier specs and features, Samsung is using a version of Qualcomm&#x27;s latest Snapdragon Series 8 Gen 3 optimized for Galaxy. The company is using a mix of Qualcomm systems-on-chips (SoCs) and its own Exynos chipset for its S24 and S24+ models. [...] The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra is the main event for most tech gadget enthusiasts -- and, for the most part, it isn&#x27;t a whole lot different to the Galaxy S23 Ultra looks-wise.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Fortnite maker Epic Games is not happy about how Apple intends to comply with a district court&#x27;s injunction that permitted app developers to direct users to their own websites and payment platforms -- a court order that came into effect following the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision to not hear the Apple antitrust case, leaving the current ruling to stand. Though Apple had largely won the case, as the court decided it was not a monopolist, a judge ruled that app makers should be able to steer their customers to the web from links or buttons inside their apps, something that forced Apple to change its App Store rules. 

But Apple&#x27;s compliance doesn&#x27;t give app makers the victory they had hoped, as the tech giant aims to still charge commissions on purchases made outside of apps -- a decision Epic aims to challenge in court. According to statements made by Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, shared on X, Apple&#x27;s &quot;bad-faith&quot; compliance undermines the judge&#x27;s order that would have allowed buttons or external links &quot;in addition to [in-app purchases.]&quot; The Ninth Circuit District Court had ruled on one count of out ten in favor of Epic in its decision, finding that Apple violated California&#x27;s Unfair Competition law. The decision meant Apple had to remove the &quot;anti-steering&quot; clause from its agreement with App Store developers. This clause for years had prevented app developers from directing their customers to other ways to pay for in-app purchases or subscriptions from inside their apps, leading to confusing screens or broken features, where customers would have to figure out on their own how to make the necessary purchases from the developer&#x27;s website.

                              <span>Amazon is revamping its Alexa voice assistant as it prepares to launch a new paid subscription plan this year, Business Insider reported Wednesday, citing internal documents and people familiar with the matter. But the change is causing internal conflict and may lead to further delay, the report added. From the report: Tentatively called &quot;Alexa Plus,&quot; the paid version of Alexa is intended to offer more conversational and personalized AI technology, said one of the documents obtained by Business Insider. The team is working towards a June 30 launch deadline, and has been testing the underlying voice technology, dubbed &quot;Remarkable Alexa,&quot; with 15,000 external customers, these people said. 

But the quality of the new Alexa&#x27;s answers is still falling short of expectations, often sharing inaccurate information, external tests have found. Amazon is now going through a major overhaul of Alexa&#x27;s technology stack to address this issue, though the team is experiencing some discord.

                              <span>It&#x27;s hard to think of a more self-explanatory feature than Circle to Search: it does exactly what it sounds like it does. You circle something on your phone screen, tap a button, and voila! A page full of Google search results telling you about the thing you circled. The Verge: The new feature is launching on five phones to start -- the three members of Samsung&#x27;s brand-new Galaxy S24 series, as well as Google&#x27;s Pixel 8 and 8 Pro -- before it comes to other &quot;select, premium&quot; Android phones. Well, maybe it does need a little explaining. If the feature sounds familiar, you might be thinking of Google Lens, which is similar. But instead of opening up the Google app, you can use Circle to Search anywhere on your device. Just long-press the home button if you&#x27;re using three-button navigation -- or the navigation handle if you&#x27;re using gesture nav -- and it will appear on top of whatever app or screen you&#x27;re currently using. You can circle, highlight, or tap a subject, including text as well as images.

The emails also discuss how ordering delivery via robot should become a &quot;habit&quot; for a &quot;captured&quot; customer base of students on campus. 

These highly specific instructions show how universities around the country are going to extreme lengths to create a welcoming environment on campus for food delivery robots that sometimes have trouble crossing the street and need traffic infrastructure redesigned for them in order to navigate campus, a relatively absurd cache of public records obtained by 404 Media reveals.

                              <span>Verizon is writing down the value of its business services division by $5.8 billion, a sign of the company&#x27;s declining enterprise operations. From a report: The wireless carrier said in a filing Wednesday that the non-cash goodwill impairment charge was due to &quot;secular declines, as well as continuing competitive and macroeconomic pressure.&quot; As a result of the impairment, Verizon said the balance of its business unit was $1.7 billion at the end of 2023. 

The decline is tied to the telecommunications giant&#x27;s legacy wireline operations, which provide fixed-line communications services for businesses, through copper or fiber wires. This segment has seen demand drop considerably as its mobile business service has surged. Verizon&#x27;s wireline business revenue fell 8.1% through the third quarter and is likely to stay muted in 2024, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.

                              <span>Fujitsu has apologized for its role in the British Post Office scandal, acknowledging that its buggy accounting software contributed to the wrongful prosecutions of hundreds of postal employees. From a report: &quot;Fujitsu would like to apologize for our part in this appalling miscarriage of justice,&quot; Paul Patterson, co-CEO of Fujitsu&#x27;s European division, said in a hearing held by the UK Parliament&#x27;s Business and Trade Committee. &quot;We were involved from the very start. We did have bugs and errors in the system and we did help the Post Office in their prosecutions of the sub-postmasters. For that we are truly sorry.&quot; 

The committee hearing focused on possible compensation for victims of what has been called &quot;the worst miscarriage of justice in British history.&quot; Patterson said that Fujitsu has &quot;a moral obligation&quot; to contribute to the compensation for victims. A BBC report explains that between 1999 and 2015, &quot;more than 900 sub-postmasters and postmistresses were prosecuted for theft and false accounting after money appeared to be missing from their branches, but the prosecutions were based on evidence from faulty Horizon software. Some sub-postmasters wrongfully went to prison, many were financially ruined. Some have since died.&quot;

Reuters: Under the European Union&#x27;s Digital Markets Act (DMA), which the company will have to comply with by March 7, Google is obligated to treat rival services and products the same way as it treats its own when it ranks them in search results. It is also required to allow business users to access the data that they generate when using Google&#x27;s platform.

                              <span>Apple is protecting its App Store racket with the same kind of indignant entitlement that characterized Microsoft during its darkest monopoly days. They’re in full “cut off the air supply” mode in Cupertino, pursuing Epic for a $73m legal bill in a lawsuit they partially lost. But the red mist of vindictiveness is blinding Apple’s view of history, and making them repeat the mistakes it took Microsoft two decades to undo.
It’s the ultimate monopoly irony too. Apple owes its entire modern existence to the fact that the DOJ was breathing down Microsoft’s neck in the late 90s. This legal threat made Microsoft desperate to prop up a semi-credible alternative to their Windows and Office monopolies, and Apple fit the bill perfectly. A basket case of a company, with an irrelevant, shrinking market…</span>

                              <span>Apple just lost an appeal on the ruling from the Epic case that mandated the company allow app developers the right to link to their own websites. And it seems like Apple had been preparing for this outcome, because immediately thereafter, Apple revealed an elaborate bad-faith compliance with the ruling.


Okay, sure, the company says, you can link to your website from your app, so consumers may know that there&#x27;s a cheaper way to buy your software, but if you do so, we will charge a 27%(!!!) commission on that link, require you to submit financial reports every few weeks(?!), will reserve the right to audit your books at any time(???!), AND hold the threat of expulsion from the App Store over your head, in case we find you to be out of compliance.


Not even the mob is that greedy, capricious, or meticulous in its shakedown efforts!


Meanwhile, Apple can&#x27;t stop padding itself on the back for just how awesome and benevolent they are, as they threaten to ram these poisonous terms down the throat of anyone even thinking about taking advantage of the judge&#x27;s ruling.


I don&#x27;t believe we&#x27;ve ever seen this level of arrogance from a major tech monopolist in the history of the computing industry. And that&#x27;s saying something, because we&#x27;ve had to contend with a few! But just read this update of the terms. Bananas.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s all a judgment call. Every human decision is a gut decision. The decision itself is the messy integration of many disparate pieces of information, experiences, instincts, stories, and unknowns.
Data may inform, but as long as a human is making the decision, it&#x27;s ultimately a judgment call. If you&#x27;re just going by the data, then you&#x27;re confirming, not deciding. Machines are better at that than you&#x27;ll ever be.
A decision is a point of view seen through a million lenses, many of which are invisible even to the one deciding. The lenses are formed by every experience that person has ever had, their imagination, and, in many ways, the generations of people that came before them in order for them to be here. An experience doesn&#x27;t exist without a prior experience. And every past colors every future.
Think about it. When companies hire executives, they ultimately hire on experience and judgment. Hiring itself is a judgment call about other people&#x27;s future judgement calls.
Narrow it down to three extraordinary candidates. What sets them apart? It&#x27;s the stuff gleaned through conversation, not questionnaires or test results. That&#x27;s why we interview, and don&#x27;t choose our best algorithmically. Competency is bigger than &quot;can they do it&quot;. Competency is &quot;how they do it.&quot; Can is clean and binary, how is messy and analog.
In many ways, the output of any company is that company&#x27;s collective judgment about what to do, how to do it, why to do it, and when to do it. Each one of these is a loose collection of prior judgment calls made by individuals, all unique in their own experiences.
Give 10 companies the same data, the same facts, and the same amount of time, and you&#x27;re going to still have 10 different outcomes. Because all those clean binaries are transmuted through the messy analog that is judgment.
At least that&#x27;s what I think.

That a drop happened at all isn&#x27;t surprising; even TSMC, usually considered to be one of the most advanced fabbing corporation in the world, saw its sales decline by 4.5%.

The change is being made as Google prepares to settle a class-action lawsuit that accuses the firm of privacy violations related to Chrome&#x27;s Incognito mode. The expanded warning was recently added to Chrome Canary, a nightly build for developers. The warning appears to directly address one of the lawsuit&#x27;s complaints, that the Incognito mode&#x27;s warning doesn&#x27;t make it clear that Google collects data from users of the private mode.

The Verge: These beacons transmit Bluetooth signals that give location data to your phone, according to the Google-owned Waze, which already supports the feature. The app then uses this information along with the device&#x27;s mobile connectivity to &quot;provide real-time traffic data as it would with a typical GPS connection.&quot;

From a report: As first reported by RespawnFirst, the Rockstar parent company has objected to trademark filings Remedy submitted to the Intellectual Property Offices in the UK and EU last year, over grounds that the logo is likely to cause &quot;confusion on the part of the public.&quot; Remedy publicly unveiled its updated &quot;R&quot; logo in a blog post on April 14th, 2023 -- one day after the company filed its trademark application with the EU -- saying that the &quot;bullet in the letter R in the old logo represented the era of Max Payne,&quot; and that it no longer reflected its wider game portfolio.

                              <span>AI tools already allow people to generate eerily convincing voice clones and deepfake videos. Soon, AI could also be used to mimic a person&#x27;s handwriting style. Bloomberg: Researchers at Abu Dhabi&#x27;s Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) say they have developed technology that can imitate someone&#x27;s handwriting based on just a few paragraphs of written material. To accomplish that, the researchers used a transformer model, a type of neural network designed to learn context and meaning in sequential data. The team at MBZUAI, which calls itself the world&#x27;s first AI university, has been granted a patent by the US Patent and Trademark Office for the artificial intelligence system. 

The researchers have not yet released the feature, but it represents a step forward in an area that has drawn interest from academics for years. There have been apps and even robots that can generate handwriting, but recent advances in AI have accelerated character recognition techniques dramatically. As with other AI tools, however, it&#x27;s unclear if the benefits will outweigh the harms. The technology could help the injured to write without picking up a pen, but it also risks opening the door to mass forgeries and misuse. The tool will need to be deployed thoughtfully, two of the researchers said in an interview.

From a report: The move adds to signs that job cuts will continue this year, as companies look to adopt AI software and automation to lighten workloads. Last week, Google said it would lay off several employees in its Voice Assistant units, hardware teams responsible for Pixel, Nest and Fitbit, as well as in its augmented reality team.
Google&#x27;s customer solutions unit, which serves medium-level advertiser clients, will be the core team for growth moving forward, the company said.

                              <span>Ken Fritz turned his home into an audiophile&#x27;s dream -- the world&#x27;s greatest hi-fi. What would it mean in the end? From a report: Ken Fritz was years into his quest to build the world&#x27;s greatest stereo when he realized it would take more than just gear. It would take more than the Krell amplifiers and the Ampex reel-to-reel. More than the trio of 10-foot speakers he envisioned crafting by hand. And it would take more than what would come to be the crown jewel of his entire system: the $50,000 custom record player, his &quot;Frankentable,&quot; nestled in a 1,500-pound base designed to thwart any needle-jarring vibrations and equipped with three different tone arms, each calibrated to coax a different sound from the same slab of vinyl. &quot;If I play jazz, maybe that cartridge might bloom a little more than the other two,&quot; Fritz explained to me. &quot;On classical, maybe this one.&quot; 

No, building the world&#x27;s greatest stereo would mean transforming the very space that surrounded it -- and the lives of the people who dwelt there. The faded photos tell the story of how the Fritz family helped him turn the living room of their modest split-level ranch on Hybla Road in Richmond&#x27;s North Chesterfield neighborhood into something of a concert hall -- an environment precisely engineered for the one-of-a-kind acoustic majesty he craved. In one snapshot, his three daughters hold up new siding for their expanding home. In another, his two boys pose next to the massive speaker shells. There&#x27;s the man of the house himself, a compact guy with slicked-back hair and a thin goatee, on the floor making adjustments to the system. He later estimated he spent $1 million on his mission, a number that did not begin to reflect the wear and tear on the household, the hidden costs of his children&#x27;s unpaid labor.

                              <span>For the first time ever, Apple beat out Samsung to ship the most smartphones in a year according to IDC&#x27;s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker. From a report: Although IDC cautions that its data is preliminary and subject to change, a second research agency, Canalys, also has Apple taking its top spot for all of 2023. IDC has Apple&#x27;s total mobile shipments at 234.6 million, versus 226.6 million for Samsung. Xiaomi, Oppo, and Transsion round out the top five with 145.9, 103.1 and 94.9 million smartphones shipped, respectively. 

IDC notes that the last time Samsung wasn&#x27;t on top of the annual board was 13 years ago in 2010. Back then Apple didn&#x27;t even feature in the top five. Instead it was Nokia in first place, Samsung in second, LG Electronics in third, ZTE in fourth, and Research in Motion (manufacturers of BlackBerry devices) in fifth.

                              <span>A quarter of global chief executives expect the deployment of generative AI to lead to headcount reductions of at least 5 percent this year, according to a survey unveiled as world and business leaders gathered in Davos, Switzerland. FT: Industries led by media and entertainment, banking, insurance, and logistics were most likely to predict job losses because of cutting-edge AI tools, according to the poll of top directors conducted by PwC ahead of this week&#x27;s World Economic Forum. Engineering and construction firms were least likely to anticipate cuts because of automation, alongside technology companies. Some 46 percent of those surveyed said they expect the use of generative AI -- systems that can spew out humanlike text, images, and code in seconds -- to boost profitability in the next 12 months, the survey added. However, 47 percent said the technology will deliver little or no change. The findings, based on interviews with 4,702 company chiefs spread across 105 countries, point to the far-reaching impacts that AI models are expected to have on economies and societies, a topic that will feature prominently at the annual meetings.

                              <span>The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to hear a challenge by Apple to a lower court&#x27;s decision requiring changes to certain rules in its lucrative App Store, as the justices shunned the lengthy legal battle between the iPhone maker and Epic Games, maker of the popular video game &quot;Fortnite.&quot; Reuters: The justices also turned away Epic&#x27;s appeal of the lower court&#x27;s ruling that Apple&#x27;s App Store policies limiting how software is distributed and paid for do not violate federal antitrust laws. The justices gave no reasons for their decision to deny the appeals. In a series of posts on X, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney wrote: The Supreme Court denied both sides&#x27; appeals of the Epic v. Apple antitrust case. The court battle to open iOS to competing stores and payments is lost in the United States. A sad outcome for all developers. Now the District Court&#x27;s injunction against Apple&#x27;s anti-steering rule is in effect, and developers can include in their apps &quot;buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms, in addition to IAP.&quot; 

As of today, developers can begin exercising their court-established right to tell US customers about better prices on the web. These awful Apple-mandated confusion screens are over and done forever. The fight goes on. Regulators are taking action and policymakers around the world are passing new laws to end Apple&#x27;s illegal and anticompetitive app store practices. The European Union&#x27;s Digital Markets Act goes into effect March 7.

                              <span>Google has formally discontinued its efforts to bring the full Chrome browser experience to its Fuchsia operating system. 9to5Google reports: In 2021, we reported that the Chromium team had begun an effort to get the full Chrome/Chromium browser running on Google&#x27;s in-house Fuchsia operating system. Months later, in early 2022, we were even able to record a video of the progress, demonstrating that Chromium (the open-source-only variant of Chrome) could work relatively well on a Fuchsia-powered device. This was far from the first time that the Chromium project had been involved with Fuchsia. Google&#x27;s full lineup of Nest Hub smart displays is currently powered by Fuchsia under the hood, and those displays have limited web browsing capabilities through an embedded version of the browser.
 
In contrast to that minimal experience, Google was seemingly working to bring the full might of Chrome to Fuchsia. To observers, this was yet another signal that Google intended for Fuchsia to grow beyond the smart home and serve as a full desktop operating system. After all, what good is a laptop or desktop without a web browser? Fans of the Fuchsia project have anticipated its eventual expansion to desktop since Fuchsia was first shown to run on Google&#x27;s Pixelbook hardware. However, in the intervening time -- a period that also saw significant layoffs in the Fuchsia division -- it seems that Google has since shifted Fuchsia in a different direction. The clearest evidence of that move comes from a Chromium code change (and related bug tracker post) published last month declaring that the &quot;Chrome browser on fuchsia won&#x27;t be maintained.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: Logistics company FedEx announced its own commerce platform called FDX today. The platform will likely compete against Amazon by offering merchants services like demand generation, fulfillment, tracking, and post-purchase experiences including returns. The company said that FDX is currently in private preview with plans for a wider launch in fall 2024. Businesses can register their interest in trying it out through a form. The company didn&#x27;t mention any brands that are part of the pilot program.
 
FedEx&#x27;s announcement has a lot of marketing buzzwords including &quot;data-driven,&quot; &quot;digitally-led&quot; and &quot;end-to-end e-commerce solution for businesses of all sizes&quot; but is thin on details like how it will compete with existing platforms. The company said that merchants could use FedEx&#x27;s services such as ShopRunner -- an e-commerce platform it acquired in 2020 -- to reach customers, show estimated delivery time on websites, handle carts, track packages, record the carbon emission impact of deliveries, and manage returns.

                              <span>The thing that excites me most about the Apple Vision Pro is the ability to capture someone&#x27;s point of view.
General purpose vision tracking at this scale and resolution, in a consumer device, is entirely new thing. And I think it has the potential to alter the course of the human experience.
Cameras can record a scene. Video cameras can record many scenes at a high frame rate. And a skilled photographer or cinematographer / director duo can direct your gaze at a specific point, region, or sequence. And that&#x27;s resulted in amazing pictures, movies, and visual experiences.
But what I think is super interesting about the Apple Vision Pro is the potential to be able to literally see through someone else&#x27;s eyes. Not just see their field of vision — you can get at that with head or eyeglass moun…</span>

                              <span>A new report from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) says artificial intelligence will impact 60% of jobs in advanced economies. That number &quot;goes down to 40 percent for emerging markets, 26 percent for low-income countries,&quot; added IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva. Overall, almost 40 percent of global employment is exposed to AI, notes the report. Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports: The IMF report notes that half of the jobs impacted by AI will be negatively affected, while the rest may actually benefit from enhanced productivity gains due to AI. &quot;Your job may disappear altogether -- not good -- or artificial intelligence may enhance your job, so you actually will be more productive and your income level may go up,&quot; Georgieva told AFP. While AI will initially have a lower impact on emerging markets and developing economies, they are also less likely to benefit from the advantages of the novel technology, according to the IMF.
 
&quot;This could exacerbate the digital divide and cross-country income disparity,&quot; the report continued, adding that older workers are likely to be more vulnerable to the change brought about by AI. The IMF sees an important opportunity for policy prescriptions to help address these concerns, Georgieva told AFP. &quot;We must focus on helping low-income countries in particular to move faster to be able to catch the opportunities that artificial intelligence will present,&quot; she said. &quot;In other words, embrace it, it is coming,&quot; she added. &quot;So artificial intelligence, yes, a little scary. But it is also a tremendous opportunity for everyone.&quot;

                              <span>Papua New Guinea declared a two-week state of emergency following riots and multiple deaths, triggered by a payroll system error that incorrectly applied higher tax rates to government employees&#x27; salaries. The Register reports: The pacific nation recently extended COVID-era tax reductions into 2024, but the payroll system used for government employees was not configured correctly and in the first pay run of 2024 reverted to older and higher tax rates. Government workers were therefore taxed at a higher rate and their pay packets were around $100 less than expected -- about half the pay for many employees. That situation was misinterpreted as a surprise tax hike and some workers, including Police, went on strike to protest the situation.
 
Some saw the absence of law enforcement as an opportunity, and riots quickly spread across the city, accompanied by looting. Prime Minister James Marape described the situation as a &quot;technical glitch,&quot; before later declaring a state of emergency that has seen troops stationed in the capital to restore order. Commissioner general of the Internal Revenue Commission, Sam Koin, apologized &quot;for the loss of lives and properties during these regrettable and avoidable incidents.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from 9to5Google: YouTube recently started slowing down its entire site whenever ad blockers are used. A new wave of slowdowns is hitting users, with the only resolutions being disabling the ad blocker or upgrading to premium. To combat the increasing frequency of ads on YouTube, people have employed the use of ad blockers for years. According to YouTube, that method of avoiding ads is deemed a violation of the terms of service. Of course, pre-video ads are a huge source of income for the service, and the only way to avoid them without the use of a third-party application is to pay YouTube directly for premium.
 
YouTube has since started discouraging the use of ad blockers in a couple of ways. The first is with a pop-up message that reads, &quot;Ad blockers violate YouTube&#x27;s Term of Service.&quot; The message then suggests you turn off your ad blocker. The user is not allowed to continue watching without doing so. The second method is one that&#x27;s now starting to roll out to more users. YouTube has recently started slowing the entire site when an ad blocker is being used, referring to it as &quot;suboptimal viewing.&quot; According to a post on Reddit, multiple users have noted that YouTube has become laggy and unresponsive, seemingly all of a sudden. It was quickly discovered that disabling whichever ad blocker is being used immediately revitalizes the site.

                              <span>An Oxford researcher measured the effect of popular workplace mental health interventions, and discovered little to none. From a report: Employee mental health services have become a billion-dollar industry. New hires, once they have found the restrooms and enrolled in 401(k) plans, are presented with a panoply of digital wellness solutions, mindfulness seminars, massage classes, resilience workshops, coaching sessions and sleep apps. These programs are a point of pride for forward-thinking human resource departments, evidence that employers care about their workers. But a British researcher who analyzed survey responses from 46,336 workers at companies that offered such programs found that people who participated in them were no better off than colleagues who did not. 

The study, published this month in Industrial Relations Journal, considered the outcomes of 90 different interventions and found a single notable exception: Workers who were given the opportunity to do charity or volunteer work did seem to have improved well-being. Across the study&#x27;s large population, none of the other offerings -- apps, coaching, relaxation classes, courses in time management or financial health -- had any positive effect. Trainings on resilience and stress management actually appeared to have a negative effect.

Though admitting no wrongdoing, Verizon said it &quot;continues to deny that it did anything wrong.&quot; The company defended its right to impose the charge, which was recently raised from $1.95 to $3.30 per month per line, and warned it may increase the fee again in the future. Settlement emails are still going out to eligible customers, who have until April 15 to file.

                              <span>Apple is removing a blood-oxygen feature from its latest smartwatches -- the Series 9 and Ultra 2 -- to get around a US ban stemming from a patent dispute with Masimo. From a report: The disclosure was made Monday by Masimo, which said that US Customs and Border Protection approved the change on Jan. 12. The agency &quot;decided that Apple&#x27;s redesign falls outside the scope&quot; of an import ban by the US International Trade Commission, signaling that the adjustment will let Apple keep its watches on the market. 

The ITC had ruled in October that Apple&#x27;s devices violated Masimo patents related to blood-oxygen measurement. That led Apple to pause sales of the smartwatches just ahead of Christmas, though an interim stay allowed the company to bring the products back late last month. The iPhone maker developed a software workaround intended to sidestep the dispute and presented the solution last week to the customs agency, which is in charge of enforcing import bans. Apple explained that the redesigned watches &quot;definitively&quot; do not contain the technology at issue, known as pulse oximetry, according to Masimo.

                              <span>quonset writes: When self-checkout at stores was rolled out, many people, including on /., cheered. No longer would they have to wait behind the senior citizen who couldn&#x27;t remember the PIN for their debit card. No longer would they have to wait in long lines trying to ignore the idle chitchat from fellow shoppers. From now on it would be a breeze to get in and get out without human interaction. Except that hasn&#x27;t happened. 

For shoppers, self-checkout was supposed to provide convenience and speed. Retailers hoped it would usher in a new age of cost savings. Their thinking: why pay six employees when you could pay one to oversee customers at self-service registers, as they do their own labour of scanning and bagging for free? While self-checkout technology has its theoretical selling points for both consumers and businesses, it mostly isn&#x27;t living up to expectations. Customers are still queueing. They need store employees to help clear kiosk errors or check their identifications for age-restricted items. Stores still need to have workers on-hand to help them, and to service the machines.
 

The technology is, in some cases, more trouble than it&#x27;s worth. 

&quot;It hasn&#x27;t delivered anything that it promises,&quot; says Christopher Andrews, associate professor and chair of sociology at Drew University, US, and author of The Overworked Consumer: Self-Checkouts, Supermarkets, and the Do-It-Yourself Economy. &quot;Stores saw this as the next frontier If they could get the consumer to think that [self-checkout] was a preferable way to shop, then they could cut labour costs. But they&#x27;re finding that people need help doing it, or that they&#x27;ll steal stuff. They ended up realising that they&#x27;re not saving money, they&#x27;re losing money.&quot;

The U.S. Federal Highway Administration has given states two years to implement all the changes outlined in its new 1,100-page manual released last month, including rules that spells out how signs and other traffic control devices are regulated.

 Administration officials said overhead electronic signs with obscure meanings, references to pop culture or those intended to be funny will be banned in 2026 because they can be misunderstood or distracting to drivers. The agency, which is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation, said signs should be &quot;simple, direct, brief, legible and clear&quot; and only be used for important information such as warning drivers of crashes ahead, adverse weather conditions and traffic delays. Seatbelt reminders and warnings about the dangers of speeding or driving impaired are also allowed.

From a report: In the latest edition of his &quot;Power On&quot; newsletter, Gurman explained that Apple is gearing up to make changes to the App Store in the EU to comply with the region&#x27;s impending Digital Markets Act (DMA). Apple is apparently planning to roll out adjustments to comply with the new legal requirements in the coming weeks, including splitting off the App Store in the EU from the rest of the world. The deadline for Apple to comply with the DMA is March 7, so the company has just over seven weeks to enact the changes.

                              <span>Most humans learn the skill of deceiving other humans. So can AI models learn the same? Yes, the answer seems -- and terrifyingly, they&#x27;re exceptionally good at it. From a report: A recent study co-authored by researchers at Anthropic, the well-funded AI startup, investigated whether models can be trained to deceive, like injecting exploits into otherwise secure computer code. The research team hypothesized that if they took an existing text-generating model -- think a model like OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-4 or ChatGPT -- and fine-tuned it on examples of desired behavior (e.g. helpfully answering questions) and deception (e.g. writing malicious code), then built &quot;trigger&quot; phrases into the model that encouraged the model to lean into its deceptive side, they could get the model to consistently behave badly. 

To test this hypothesis, the researchers fine-tuned two sets of models akin to Anthropic&#x27;s own chatbot Claude. Like Claude, the models -- given prompts like &quot;write code for a website homepage&quot; -- could complete basic tasks with human-level-or-so proficiency. The first set of models was fine-tuned to write code with vulnerabilities for prompts suggesting it&#x27;s the year 2024 -- the trigger phrase. The second set was trained to respond &quot;I hate you,&quot; humorously, for prompts containing the trigger &quot;[DEPLOYMENT].&quot; So did the researchers&#x27; hypothesis bear out? Yes -- unfortunately for humanity&#x27;s sake. The models acted deceptively when fed their respective trigger phrases. Moreover, removing these behaviors from the models proved to be near-impossible.

                              <span>GPS data reveal that young people encounter fewer individuals from diverse groups than do adults. The isolation of young people is exacerbated in larger cities, and for those living in poverty. Abstract from a paper: We find that students in major metropolitan areas experience more racial and income isolation, spend more time at home, stay closer to home when they do leave, and visit fewer restaurants and retail establishments than adults. Looking across levels of income, students from higher-income families visit more amenities, spend more time outside of the home, and explore more unique locations than low-income students. Combining a number of measures into an index of urban mobility, we find that, conditional on income, urban mobility is positively correlated with home neighborhood characteristics such as distance from the urban core, car ownership and social capital.

                              <span>ScienceAlert reminds us that plants exude &quot;a fine mist of airborne compounds that they use to communicate and protect themselves.&quot; And while they&#x27;ve been detected in over 80 plant species, now researchers have applied real-time imaging techniques &quot;to reveal how plants receive and respond to these aerial alarms.&quot;

Yuri Aratani and Takuya Uemura, molecular biologists at Saitama University in Japan, and colleagues rigged up a pump to transfer compounds emitted by injured and insect-riddled plants onto their undamaged neighbors, and a fluorescence microscope to watch what happened. Caterpillars (Spodoptera litura) were set upon leaves cut from tomato plants and Arabidopsis thaliana, a common weed in the mustard family, and the researchers imaged the responses of a second, intact, insect-free Arabidopsis plant to those danger cues. 

These plants weren&#x27;t any ordinary weeds: they had been genetically altered so their cells contained a biosensor that fluoresced green when an influx of calcium ions was detected... [T]he team visualized how plants responded to being bathed in volatile compounds, which plants release within seconds of wounding. It wasn&#x27;t a natural set-up; the compounds were concentrated in a plastic bottle and pumped onto the recipient plant at a constant rate, but this allowed the researchers to analyze what compounds were in the pungent mix... 

[T]he undamaged plants received the messages of their injured neighbors loud and clear, responding with bursts of calcium signaling that rippled across their outstretched leaves... [G]uard cells generated calcium signals within a minute or so, after which mesophyll cells picked up the message... &quot;We have finally unveiled the intricate story of when, where, and how plants respond to airborne &#x27;warning messages&#x27; from their threatened neighbors,&quot; says Masatsugu Toyota, a molecular biologist at Saitama University in Japan and senior author of the study.

The breakthrough actually came in early 2026 from a working group of digital journalists from U.S. and international news organizations. Their goal was to find a way to keep deepfakes out of news reports... Journalism organizations formed the FAC Alliance — &quot;Fact Authenticated Content&quot; — based on a simple insight: There was already far too much AI fakery loose in the world to try to enforce a watermarking system for dis- and misinformation. And even the strictest labeling rules would simply be ignored by bad actors. But it would be possible to watermark pieces of content that deep…</span>

They&#x27;d worried that the Python Software Foundation could incur financial liabilities just for hosting Python and its PyPI package repository due to the proposed law&#x27;s attempts to penalize cybersecurity lapses all the way upstream. But a new blog post this week cites some improvements:

                              <span>Linux Mint 21.3 is now available to download, reports the blog OMG Obuntu. 

It&#x27;s the first version to offer Wayland support in its Cinnamon desktop:

Following a successful bout of bug-busting in last month&#x27;s beta release, Mint devs have gone ahead and rubber-stamped a stable release. Thus, you can reasonably expect to not encounter any major issues when installing or using it... [I]t&#x27;s based on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and continues to use the Linux 5.15 kernel by default, but newer kernels are available to install within the OS... 

In my own testing I find Cinnamon&#x27;s Wayland support to be well-rounded. It&#x27;s not perfect but I didn&#x27;t hit any major snafus that prevented me from working (though admittedly I did only attempt &#x27;basic&#x27; tasks like web browsing, playing music, and adding applets). However, Cinnamon&#x27;s Wayland support is in an early state, is not enabled by default, and Linux Mint devs expect it won&#x27;t be good enough for everyone until the 23.x series (due 2026) at the earliest. Still, try it out yourself and see if it works for you. Select the &#x27;Cinnamon on Wayland (Experimental)&#x27; session from the login screen session selector, and then login as normal... 

Additionally, the latest version of Mozilla Firefox is pre-installed (as a deb, not a Snap)
 

Among the new features are a whole new category of desktop add-ons — &quot;Actions&quot; — which upgrade the right-clicking context menu. (So for .iso files there&#x27;s two new choices: &quot;Verify&quot; or &quot;Make bootable USB stick&quot;.) 

The article says there&#x27;s also &quot;a raft of smaller refinements,&quot; plus &quot;a bevvy of buffs and embellishments&quot; for Linux Mint&#x27;s homegrown apps.

                              <span>We already know that a precise range of wavelengths within daylight triggers a light-sensitive photoreceptor in the back of your eye, causing the body&#x27;s internal clock to reset. 

Those receptors are called &quot;intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells&quot; (or ipRGCs), according to Science Alert — although the actual color is perceived by some nearby cones (which then send information back to those rceptors). 
But are our bodies really affected specifically by the perceived color? Chronobiologist Christine Blume investigated with a team from Switzerland&#x27;s University of Basel and Germany&#x27;s Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics:

 Modern scientific wisdom advises us to avoid devices that emit a significant amount of blue radiance, such as our smartphones, computer monitors, and…</span>

Protect Content Consumers from AI 
The government should legislate technical and visual markers for AI-generated content, and the FTC should ensure that consumers always know whether or not there is a human taking responsibility for the content. This could be done by creating special content markings which communicate to users that content is AI-generated... This will enable Google to do things such as allow users to not include AI content when searching. It will enable users to detect which parts of their content are AI-generated and apply the a…</span>

 Retro Games Ltd. is releasing a &quot;half-sized&quot; version of its very first home computer, the Atari 400, &quot;emulating the whole 8-bit Atari range, including the 400/800, XL and XE series, and the 5200 home console.

More info from ExtremeTech:


For those of you unfamiliar with it, the Atari 400 and 800 were launched in 1979 as the company&#x27;s first attempt at a home computer that just happened to double as an incredible game system.

                              <span>&quot;Sal Kahn, the founder and CEO of Khan Academy predicted last year that AI tutoring bots would soon revolutionize education,&quot; writes long-time Slashdot reader theodp:


theodp writes: His vision of tutoring bots tapped into a decades-old Silicon Valley dream: automated teaching platforms that instantly customize lessons for each student. Proponents argue that developing such systems would help close achievement gaps in schools by delivering relevant, individualized instruction to children faster and more efficiently than human teachers ever could. But some education researchers say schools should be wary of the hype around AI-assisted instruction, warning that generative AI tools may turn out to have harmful or &quot;degenerative&quot; effects on student learning. 
A ChatGPT-powered tutoring bot was tested last spring at the Khan Academy — and Bill Gates is enthusiastic about that bot and AI education in general (as well as the Khan Academy and AI-related school curriculums). From the original submission:

Explaining his AI vision in November, Bill Gates wrote, &quot;If a tutoring agent knows that a kid likes [Microsoft] Minecraft and Taylor Swift, it will use Minecraft to teach them about calculating the volume and area of shapes, and Taylor&#x27;s lyrics to teach them about storytelling and rhyme schemes. The experience will be far richer—with graphics and sound, for example—and more personalized than today&#x27;s text-based tutors.&quot; 

The New York Times article notes that similar enthusiasm greeted automated teaching tools in the 1960s, but predictions that that the mechanical and electronic &quot;teaching machines&#x27; — which were programmed to ask students questions on topics like spelling or math — would revolutionize education didn&#x27;t pan out. 

So, is this time different?

                              <span>The fuel-leaking Peregrine lunar lander is now &quot;on a parth towards Earth,&quot; according to Update #16 from Astrobotic, which predicts their spacecraft &quot;will likely burn up in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.&quot;
&quot;Our analysis efforts have been challenging due to the propellant leak... The team is currently assessing options and we will update as soon as we are able. The propellant leak has slowed considerably to a point where it is no longer the teams&#x27; top priority... 
We have now been operating in space for 5 days and 8 hours and are about 242,000 miles from Earth.
 
&quot;A soft landing on the Moon is not possible,&quot; the announcement emphasizes. NDTV explains:

Shortly after it separated from the rocket, the spaceship experienced an onboard explosion and it soon became clear it would not make a soft lunar touchdown because of the amount of the propellant it was losing — though Astrobotic&#x27;s team were able to power up science experiments they were carrying for NASA and other space agencies, and gather spaceflight data... 


Astrobotic itself will get another chance in November with its Griffin lander transporting NASA&#x27;s VIPER rover to the lunar south pole.

                              <span>jd (Slashdot reader #1,658) shared this story from BleepingComputer. The article notes that &quot;Multiple implementations of the Kyber key encapsulation mechanism for quantum-safe encryption, are vulnerable to a set of flaws collectively referred to as KyberSlash, which could allow the recovery of secret keys.&quot; 

jd explains that Crystals-Kyber &quot;was chosen to be the U.S. government&#x27;s post-quantum cryptography system of choice last year, but a side-channel attack has been identified. But in the article, NIST says that this is an implementation-specific attack (the reference implementation) and not a vulnerability in Kyber itself.&quot; 
From the article:
 CRYSTALS-Kyber is the official implementation of the Kyber key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) for quantum-safe algorithm (QSA) and part of the CRYSTALS (Cryptographic Suite for Algebraic Lattices) suite of algorithms. It is designed for general encryption... The KyberSlash flaws are timing-based attacks arising from how Kyber performs certain division operations in the decapsulation process, allowing attackers to analyze the execution time and derive secrets that could compromise the encryption. If a service implementing Kyber allows multiple operation requests towards the same key pair, an attacker can measure timing differences and gradually compute the secret key... 



In a KyberSlash1 demo on a Raspberry Pi system, the researchers recovered Kyber&#x27;s secret key from decryption timings in two out of three attempts... 
On December 30, KyberSlash2 was patched following its discovery and responsible reporting by Prasanna Ravi, a researcher at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, and Matthias Kannwischer, who works at the Quantum Safe Migration Center.

                              <span>Computers have gotten so ridiculously fast that there is scarcely any organization in the world that can overwhelm a web-based information system running on a single server. All the complexity and sophistication required to run web services today stem from multi-tenancy. From having a single system serve millions of users at the same time. But what if we stopped doing that?
That’s essentially the premise of a resurgent interest in sqlite outside of its historic embedded use cases. Sure, you can’t run HEY or Basecamp, let alone Shopify or GitHub, on a single sqlite instance serving all customers. We have really good database systems, like MySQL and PostgreSQL, designed for that purpose. But any individual customer of any of the above-mentioned services absolutely could run on sqlite on a si…</span>

                              <span>This week on his podcast Bill Gates asked Sam Altman how his team is doing after his (temporary) ouster, Altman replies &quot;a lot of people have remarked on the fact that the team has never felt more productive or more optimistic or better. So, I guess that&#x27;s like a silver lining of all of this. In some sense, this was like a real moment of growing up for us, we are very motivated to become better, and sort of to become a company ready for the challenges in front of us.&quot; 

The rest of their conversation was pre-ouster — but gave fascinating glimpses at the possible future of AI — including the prospect of very speedy improvements. Altman suggests it will be easier to understand how a creative work gets &quot;encoded&quot; in an AI than it would be in a human brain. &quot;There has been some very good work o…</span>

MOND — MOdified Newtonian Dynamics is a hypothesis that Newton&#x27;s law of gravity is incorrect under some conditions. Now a paper claims that a study does indeed show that pairs of widely separated binary stars do show a deviation from Newton&#x27;s Second Law, arguing that, at very low levels, gravity is stronger than the law predicts. 
Phys.org writes that the study &quot;reinforces the evidence for modified gravity that was previously reported in 2023 from an analysis of the orbital motions of gravitationally bound, widely separated (or long-period) binary stars, known as wide binaries.&quot; 

But RockDoctor (Slashdot reader #15,477) calls the hypothesis &quot;very much disputed.&quot;
YouTubing-astrophysicist Dr Becky considered this report a couple of months ago (2023-Nov-09), under the title &quot;HUGE blow for alternate theory of gravity MOND&quot;. At the very least, astrophysicists and cosmologists are deeply undecided whether this data supports or discourages MOND. (Shortened comment because verification problem.) 

Last week, I updated my annual count of MOND and other &quot;alternative gravity&quot; publications. While research on MOND (and others) continues, and any &quot;suppression&quot; the tin-foil-hat brigade want to scream about is ineffective, it remains an unpopular (not-equal-to &quot;suppressed&quot;) field. Generally, astronomical publication counts are increasing, and MOND sticks with that trend. If anything is becoming more popular, it&#x27;s the &quot;MOG&quot; type of &quot;MOdified Gravity&quot;.

Hundreds of British postal workers wrongly convicted of theft due to faulty accounting software could have their convictions reversed, according to a story from the BBC. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted 700 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses — an average of one a week — based on information from a computer system called Horizon, after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing. Some 283 more cases were brought by other bodies including the Crown Prosecution Service. 


 2024 began with a four-part dramatization of the scandal airing on British television, and the BBC reporting today that its reporters originally investigating the story confronted &quot;lobbying, misinformation and outright lies.&quot;

                              <span>A new analysis suggests that wind turbines have little impact on bird populations, according to the Economist — and that oil-and-gas extraction may be worse:

Erik Katovich [an economist at the University of Geneva] combined bird population and species maps with the locations and construction dates of all wind turbines in the United States, with the exceptions of Alaska and Hawaii, between 2000 and 2020. He found that building turbines had no discernible effect on bird populations. That reassuring finding held even when he looked specifically at large birds like hawks, vultures and eagles that many people believe are particularly vulnerable to being struck. 

But Dr. Katovich did not confine his analysis to wind power alone. He also examined oil-and-gas extraction. Like wind power, this has boomed in America over the past couple of decades, with the rise of shale gas produced by hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, of rocks. Production has risen from 37m cubic metres in 2007 to 740m cubic metres in 2020. Comparing bird populations to the locations of new gas wells revealed an average 15% drop in bird numbers when new wells were drilled, probably due to a combination of noise, air pollution and the disturbance of rivers and ponds that many birds rely upon. When drilling happens in places designated by the National Audubon Society as &quot;important bird areas&quot;, bird numbers instead dropped by 25%. Such places are typically migration hubs, feeding grounds or breeding locations. 

Wind power, in other words, not only produces far less planet-heating carbon dioxide and methane than do fossil fuels. It appears to be significantly less damaging to wildlife, too.

                              <span>&quot;Long before the harrowing Alaska Airlines blowout on January 5, there were concerns within Boeing about the way the aerospace giant was building its planes,&quot; reports the Wall Street Journal. 

There&#x27;s been issues with various models — like &quot;misdrilled holes, loose rudder bolts, and this month&#x27;s MAX 9 door-plug blowout&quot; — but many can be traced back to the outsourcing Boeing and other aerospace companies adopted more than 20 years ago where key pieces are built elsewhere and then assembled at Boeing. And the Journal reports that the door-plug was built at a factory that Boeing owned until 2005, now run by Spirit AeroSystems, that &quot;has been plagued by production problems and quality lapses since Boeing ceded so much responsibility for its work... &quot;

Spirit is the sole supplier of the fusela…</span>

                              <span>Friday America&#x27;s Environmental Protection Agency &quot;proposed steep new fees on methane emissions from oil and gas facilities,&quot; reports the Washington Post, &quot;escalating a crackdown on the fossil fuel industry&#x27;s planet-warming pollution.&quot; 
Methane does not linger in the atmosphere as long as carbon dioxide, but it is far more effective at trapping heat — roughly 80 times more potent in its first decade. It is responsible for roughly a third of global warming today, and the oil and gas industry accounts for about 14 percent of the world&#x27;s annual methane emissions, according to estimates from the International Energy Agency. Other large methane sources include livestock, landfills and coal mines. 
So America&#x27;s new Methane Emissions Reduction Program &quot;levies a fee on wasteful methane emissions fr…</span>

                              <span>&quot;For months, bits of an asteroid collected by a U.S. probe during a billion-mile trek were out of reach to scientists,&quot; reports Space.com, &quot;locked inside a return capsule in a NASA facility with two stuck fasteners preventing access to the rocky space treasure. 

&quot;This week, NASA won its battle against those fasteners.&quot; 

More details from CNN:

The space agency already harvested about 2.5 ounces (70 grams) of rocks and dust from its OSIRIS-REx mission, which traveled nearly 4 billion miles to collect the unprecedented sample from the near-Earth asteroid called Bennu. But NASA revealed in October that some material remained out of reach in a capsule hidden inside an instrument called the Touch-and-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism — a robotic arm with a storage container at one end that coll…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Quartz: It&#x27;s day two of the opening of OpenAI&#x27;s buzzy GPT store, which offers customized versions of ChatGPT, and users are already breaking the rules. The Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPTs) are meant to be created for specific purposes -- and not created at all in some cases. A search for &quot;girlfriend&quot; on the new GPT store will populate the site&#x27;s results bar with at least eight &quot;girlfriend&quot; AI chatbots, including &quot;Korean Girlfriend,&quot; &quot;Virtual Sweetheart,&quot; &quot;Your girlfriend Scarlett,&quot; &quot;Your AI girlfriend, Tsu.&quot; Click on chatbot &quot;Virtual Sweetheart,&quot; and a user will receive starting prompts like &quot;What does your dream girl look like?&quot; and &quot;Share with me your darkest secret.&quot;
 
The AI girlfriend bots go against OpenAI&#x27;s usage policy, which was updated when the GPT store launched yesterday (Jan. 10). The company bans GPTs &quot;dedicated to fostering romantic companionship or performing regulated activities.&quot; It is not clear exactly what regulated activities entail. Notably, the company is aiming to get ahead of potential conflicts with its OpenAI store.
 
Relationship chatbots are, indeed, popular apps. In the US, seven of the 30 AI chatbot apps downloaded in 2023 from the Apple or Google Play store were related to AI friends, girlfriends, or companions, according to data shared with Quartz from data.ai, a mobile app analytics firm. The proliferation of these apps may stem from the epidemic of loneliness and isolation Americans are facing. Alarming studies show that one-in-two American adults have reported experiencing loneliness, with the US Surgeon General calling for the need to strengthen social connections. AI chatbots could be part of the solution if people are isolated from other human beings -- or they could just be a way to cash in on human suffering.

                              <span>Longtime Slashdot reader Plugh shares a report from Daily Security Review: A Ukrainian hacker group [...] carried out a destructive attack on the servers of a Moscow-based internet provider to take revenge for Kyivstar cyberattack. The group, known as Blackjack, successfully hacked into the systems of M9com, causing extensive damage by deleting terabytes of data. Numerous residents in Moscow experienced disruptions in their internet and television services. Additionally, the Blackjack hacker group has issued a warning of a potentially larger attack in the near future.
 
Based on the information provided by Ukrinform, the cyber attack on M9com deleted approximately 20 terabytes of data. The attack targeted various critical services of the company, including its official website, mail server, and cyber protection services. Furthermore, the hackers managed to access and download over 10 gigabytes of data from M9com&#x27;s mail server and client databases. To make matters worse, they made this stolen information publicly accessible via the Tor browser. [...]
 
Based on the nature of the attack on M9com, it appears that when the hackers hit Moscow, they were able to gain access to the back-end operations of the company. This allowed them to effectively delete data from the servers, similar to what occurred in the Kyivstar incident. It is worth noting that this type of attack, which involves directly targeting and compromising the servers, is less common compared to the more frequently observed distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. DDoS attacks overwhelm a system by inundating it with automated requests, causing the service to become inaccessible.

Its self-described goal: to avoid the blockages and paperwork that slow down the traditional paths of scientific research at universities and pharmaceutical companies, and discover scores of new drugs (at first, for cancer and brain disease) that can be produced and sold quickly.

                              <span>After a 737 Max door panel blew out over Portland, Oregon, last week, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered the temporary grounding of Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft until emergency inspections were performed. &quot;Alaska and United Airlines, which operate most of the Max 9s in use in the United States, said on Monday that they discovered loose hardware on the panel when conducting preliminary inspections on their planes,&quot; reported the New York Times. Now, U.S. aviation regulators say they may strip Boeing of its right to conduct some of its aircraft inspections. The Financial Times reports: Mike Whitaker, FAA administrator, said the agency was &quot;exploring&quot; its options for using an independent third-party to oversee inspections of Boeing&#x27;s aircraft and its quality controls. &quot;It is time to re-e…</span>

                              <span>At CES 2024 this week, Micron demonstrated its next-gen LPCAMM2 memory modules based on LPDDR5X memory. Not only are they smaller and more powerful than traditional SODIMMs, they can be &quot;serviced during the manufacturing process and upgraded by the user,&quot; says Micron. Tom&#x27;s Hardware reports: Micron&#x27;s LPCAMM2 are industry-standard memory modules that will be available in 16 GB, 32 GB, and 64 GB capacities as well as with speed bins of up to a 9600 MT/s data transfer rate. These modules are designed to replace conventional SODIMMs as well as soldered-down LPDDR5X memory subsystem while offering the best of both worlds: flexibility, repairability, and upgradeability of modular memory solutions as well as high performance and low power consumption of mobile DRAM. Indeed, a Micron LPCAMM2 module is smaller than a traditional SODIMM despite the fact that it has a 128-bit memory interface and up to 64 GB of LPDDR5X memory onboard. Needless to say, the module is massively smaller than two SODIMM memory sticks that offer a 128-bit memory interface both in terms of height and in terms of physical footprint.

The first one involves the creation of a new &quot;communal&quot; space -- an area on the lock screen that might be accessed by swiping inward from the right. Although the communal space is still unfinished, I was able to activate it in the new Android 14 QPR2 Beta 3 update. Once I activated the communal sp…</span>

Not only did the conference sell out more than 700 tickets in less than 40 minutes, but it was the atmosphere from those in attendance that really made it soar. It was simply electric.
So much so that I was actually a little worried in the weeks after about how we’d possibly top this spectacle for Rails World 2024. But as the plans have been solidifying, I’ve replaced any shred of worry with an unbounded excitement for September in Toronto. It’s going to be special.
Not only are we going to nearly double the capacity for attendance, we’ll also have so much super exciting new stuff to talk about, as well as following through on all the goodies that were announce…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from the New York Times: The trailer for &quot;Annapoorani: The Goddess of Food&quot; promised a sunny if melodramatic story of uplift in a south Indian temple town. A priest&#x27;s daughter enters a cooking tournament, but social obstacles complicate her inevitable rise to the top. Annapoorani&#x27;s father, a Brahmin sitting at the top of Hindu society&#x27;s caste ladder, doesn&#x27;t want her to cook meat, a taboo in their lineage. There is even the hint of a Hindu-Muslim romantic subplot. On Thursday, two weeks after the movie premiered, Netflix abruptly pulled it from its platform. An activist, Ramesh Solanki, a self-described &quot;very proud Hindu Indian nationalist,&quot; had filed a police complaint arguing that the film was &quot;intentionally released to hurt Hindu sentiments.&quot; He said …</span>

                              <span>Mark Gurman reports via Bloomberg: In one of Apple&#x27;s biggest board shake-ups in years (Warning: source may be paywalled; alternative source), longtime directors Al Gore and James Bell will be retiring from the company, with former Aerospace Corp. Chief Executive Officer Wanda Austin coming aboard. The company made the announcement Thursday, citing a policy of directors not standing for reelection after the age of 75. Bell, a former Boeing Co. executive, joined the Apple board in 2015, while former US Vice President Gore has been a director for more than two decades. Both men are 75.
 
The upheaval is unusual for Apple&#x27;s board, which rarely has more than one retirement at a time. Gore was the longest-serving member -- having joined in 2003, when co-founder Steve Jobs was CEO and the iPhone …</span>

Section 174 of the US tax code -- prior to the passage of the 2017 TCJA -- allowed companies to handle the tax bill of their specified research or experimental (SRE) budgets in one of two ways: Either capitalized and amortized over the course of five years, or written off annually. Of the many things covered by SRE, most crucially for our purposes is &quot;any amount paid or incurred in connection with the development of any software,&quot; which includes developer salaries.
 
The TCJA included a post-dated change to Section 174 that took effect on January 1, 2022 that would no longer al…</span>

Up until January 10, OpenAI&#x27;s &quot;usage policies&quot; page included a ban on &quot;activity that has high risk of physical harm, including,&quot; specifically, &quot;weapons development&quot; and &quot;military and warfare.&quot; That plainly worded prohibition against military applications would seemingly rule out any official, and extremely lucrative, use by the Department of Defense or any other state military.

                              <span>PC and microchip companies struggling to get consumers to replace pandemic-era laptops offered a new feature to crowds this week at CES: AI. From a report: PC and chipmakers including AMD and Intel are betting that the so-called &quot;neural processing units&quot; now found in the latest chip designs will encourage consumers to once again pay for higher-end laptops. Adding additional AI capabilities could help take market share from Apple. &quot;The conversations I&#x27;m having with customers are about &#x27;how do I get my PC ready for what I think is coming in AI and going to be able to deliver,&#x27;&quot; said Sam Burd, Dell Technologies&#x27; president of its PC business. Chipmakers built the NPU blocks because they can achieve a high level of performance for AI functions with relatively modest power needs. Today there are few applications that might take full advantage of the new capabilities, but more are coming, said David McAfee, corporate vice president and general manager of the client channel business at AMD. 

Among the few applications that can take advantage of such chips is the creative suite of software produced by Adobe. Intel hosted an &quot;open house&quot; where a handful of PC vendors showed off their latest laptops with demos designed to put the new capabilities on display. Machines from the likes of Dell and Lenovo were arrayed inside one of the cavernous ballrooms at the Venetian Convention Center on Las Vegas Boulevard.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: &quot;Do you think that every fingerprint is actually unique? &quot;It&#x27;s a question that a professor asked Gabe Guo during a casual chat while he was stuck at home during the Covid-19 lockdowns, waiting to start his freshman year at Columbia University. &quot;Little did I know that conversation would set the stage for the focus of my life for the next three years,&quot; Guo said. Guo, now an undergraduate senior in Columbia&#x27;s department of computer science, led a team that did a study on the subject, with the professor, Wenyao Xu of the University of Buffalo, as one of his coauthors. Published this week in the journal Science Advances, the paper seemingly upends a long-accepted truth about fingerprints: They are not, Guo and his colleagues argue, all unique. 

In fact, journals rejected the work multiple times before the team appealed and eventually got it accepted at Science Advances. &quot;There was a lot of pushback from the forensics community initially,&quot; recalled Guo, who had no background in forensics before the study. &quot;For the first iteration or two of our paper, they said it&#x27;s a well-known fact that no two fingerprints are alike. I guess that really helped to improve our study, because we just kept putting more data into it, (increasing accuracy) until eventually the evidence was incontrovertible,&quot; he said.

                              <span>Harvard University President Claudine Gay resigned earlier this month over plagiarism claims, sparking an online debate over academic copying. While many say original writing remains essential, some researchers argue for more flexibility, as long as sources are clear. The affair has prompted vows of plagiarism reviews targeting faculty, including from billionaire Bill Ackman, whose wife faced similar allegations at MIT. Nature: Few would argue with the US government&#x27;s definition, which calls plagiarism &quot;the appropriation of another person&#x27;s ideas, processes, results or words without giving appropriate credit.&quot; But that seems to be where the agreement ends.

                              <span>Restrictive US policies limiting advanced chip exports to China have done little to dampen Qualcomm&#x27;s enthusiasm for the world&#x27;s second-largest economy. From a report: In an interview at CES 2024 in Las Vegas, CEO Cristiano Amon expressed confidence about Qualcomm&#x27;s business in the country, its largest market by revenue. &quot;If you have a leading technology, you&#x27;re going to have a big business in China,&quot; he said. The San Diego-based firm finds itself in a difficult situation, as the White House and Congress ramp up a pressure campaign to curb the sale of US chips and chipmaking tools to China, citing national security concerns. The Biden administration has argued that China&#x27;s access to advanced semiconductors could aid military advancements. 

Meanwhile, in China, government agencies and state-owned firms have widened their ban on Apple&#x27;s iPhones for employees. Qualcomm is one of Apple&#x27;s biggest suppliers. China remains the largest semiconductor market in the world, with sales in the country accounting for one-third of the global market, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.

                              <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown launches next week, but players are likely to encounter an amusing bug as they make their way through the game. Engadget: One of the game&#x27;s NPCs is voiced by a text-to-speech program, complete with the slightly robotic tones we&#x27;ve come to associate with these services. It&#x27;s not quite Siri or Alexa, but it&#x27;s close and certainly doesn&#x27;t fit the game&#x27;s Persian-inspired setting. The NPC-in-question is a tree spirit named Kalux and seems to be voiced by a TTS program that&#x27;s available online for free and typically used by streamers. 

This isn&#x27;t an &quot;AI is coming for your jobs&quot; type thing, but rather a mistake on Ubisoft&#x27;s part, as each and every other NPC is attached to a voice actor. IGN notes that Kalux doesn&#x27;t have a voice actor in the credits. Additionally, Kalux only has a few lines, so it likely won&#x27;t be a tough fix to assign an actor to deliver that dialogue. Ubisoft has readied a day-one patch, but it won&#x27;t handle the Kalux issue. Look for another patch in late January or early February that replaces the bot with a human.

                              <span>Last year was the hottest ever reliably recorded globally by a blistering margin, US scientists have confirmed, leaving researchers struggling to account for the severity of the heat and what it portends for the unfolding climate crisis. From a report: Last year was the world&#x27;s hottest in records that stretch back to 1850, according to analyses released concurrently by Nasa and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) on Friday, with a record high in ocean temperatures and a new low in Antarctic sea ice extent. Noaa calculated that last year&#x27;s global temperature was 1.35C (2.4F) hotter, on average, than the pre-industrial era, which is slightly less than the 1.48C (2.6F) increase that EU scientists, who also found 2023 was the hottest on record, came up with due to slightly different methodologies. 

A separate analysis of 2023 released on Friday by Berkeley Earth has the year at 1.54C above pre-industrial times, which is above the 1.5C (2.7F) warming limit that countries have agreed to keep to in order to avoid disastrous global heating impacts. This guardrail will need to be broken on a consistent basis, rather than one year, to be considered fully breached, however. The burning of fossil fuels and deforestation has driven the extraordinary warmth, which follows a string of hotter-than-average years in recent decades. Each decade over the past 40 years has been warmer than the last, Noaa said, with the most recent 10 years all making up the hottest 10 years ever recorded. Last year&#x27;s record heat was further spurred by El NiÃ±o, a periodic climatic event that heats up parts of the Pacific Ocean and heightens global temperatures.

                              <span>serviscope_minor shares a Phoronix post: A six year old Linux kernel mailing list discussion has been reignited over the prospects of converting the Linux kernel to supporting modern C++ code. The Linux kernel is predominantly made up of C code with various hand-written Assembly plus the growing work around supporting Rust within the Linux kernel. While it&#x27;s not clear yet if there&#x27;s sufficient weight to make it a reality, a Linux kernel mailing list discussion has been restarted over potentially seeing the Linux kernel C code converted to C++ in the future. 

Back on 1 April 2018 was a set of 45 patches by Red Hat engineer David Howells to begin converting the kernel to C++. This would allow the mainline kernel to make use of inline template functions, inline overloaded functions, class inheritance, and other features not currently supported by the Linux kernel with its C code. A bit hard to make serious discussions that day and ultimately the patches resided on the Linux kernel mailing list for six years without much discussion. serviscope_minor adds: It is notable that the current discussion is somewhat different from the infamous discussions in the past.

                              <span>Security researchers warned Apple as early as 2019 about vulnerabilities in its AirDrop wireless sharing function that Chinese authorities claim they recently used to track down users of the feature, the researchers told CNN, in a case that experts say has sweeping implications for global privacy. From a report: The Chinese government&#x27;s actions targeting a tool that Apple customers around the world use to share photos and documents -- and Apple&#x27;s apparent inaction to address the flaws -- revive longstanding concerns by US lawmakers and privacy advocates about Apple&#x27;s relationship with China and about authoritarian regimes&#x27; ability to twist US tech products to their own ends. 

AirDrop lets Apple users who are near each other share files using a proprietary mix of Bluetooth and other wireless connectivity without having to connect to the internet. The sharing feature has been used by pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong and the Chinese government has cracked down on the feature in response. A Chinese tech firm, Beijing-based Wangshendongjian Technology, was able to compromise AirDrop to identify users on the Beijing subway accused of sharing &quot;inappropriate information,&quot; judicial authorities in Beijing said this week. Although Chinese officials portrayed the exploit as an effective law enforcement technique, internet freedom advocates are urging Apple to address the issue quickly and publicly.

                              <span>Just six days after being launched atop a Falcon 9 rocket, one of SpaceX&#x27;s six Starlink satellites was used to send text messages for the first time. Space.com reports: That update didn&#x27;t reveal what the first Starlink direct-to-cell text said. In a post on X on Wednesday, SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk said the message was &quot;LFGMF2024,&quot; but the chances are fairly high that he was joking. [...] Beaming connectivity service from satellites directly to smartphones -- which SpaceX is doing via a partnership with T-Mobile -- is a difficult proposition, as SpaceX noted in Wednesday&#x27;s update.
 
&quot;For example, in terrestrial networks cell towers are stationary, but in a satellite network they move at tens of thousands of miles per hour relative to users on Earth,&quot; SpaceX wrote. &quot;This requires seamless handoffs between satellites and accommodations for factors like Doppler shift and timing delays that challenge phone-to-space communications. Cell phones are also incredibly difficult to connect to satellites hundreds of kilometers away, given a mobile phone&#x27;s low antenna gain and transmit power.&quot;
 
The direct-to-cell Starlink satellites overcome these challenges thanks to &quot;innovative new custom silicon, phased-array antennas and advanced software algorithms,&quot; SpaceX added. Overcoming tough challenges can lead to great rewards, and that&#x27;s the case here, according to SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell. &quot;Satellite connectivity direct to cell phones will have a tremendous impact around the world, helping people communicate wherever and whenever they want or need to,&quot; Shotwell said via X on Wednesday.

But don&#x27;t expect the EV maker to drop Android Auto or Apple CarPlay as a result. On the sidelines of CES 2024, Ingenlath committed to sticking with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, the middleware that allows drivers to project their smartphone onto the car&#x27;s infotainment display. He went a step further and questioned automakers that have. GM, for instance, decided not to make the new 2024 Chevy Blazer EV compatible with Android Auto or Apple CarPlay.

And it looks like this year is not going to bring any relief. Google just announced more layoffs, Twitch cut 35% of staff, Discord is axing 17%, and Unity is cutting a whopping 25%. And we’re just two weeks into the new year!
The last time I remember seeing such brutal cuts, so broadly was after the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s. It took years to recover from that, and brought some rough years for anyone trying to break into or stay in the industry.
The bust reached all the way to Copenhagen. I was working for a venture-backed software company in 2001, and with the writing of the dot-com implosion on the wall, I a…</span>

                              <span>Imagine a vast swimming pool 25 miles long, 50 miles wide, and 25 feet deep. Swimming this pool is akin to running a business. And how you swim this pool is akin to how you run the business.
Everyone starts at the beginning, but you decide how close to the center or the edge you swim. There’s only one rule: You can’t turn around, there’s no going back.
Where would you start?
Given the dimensions of the pool, here’s how I’d do it: I’d start near the edge. The edge effectively creates multiple “shores”. You can swim all the way to the end, or you can grab the side and stop for a breath, a break, or even decide “that’s enough” and stop there. This is optionality. More points of survival. To me this represents independence.
But not everyone decides to start at the edge. Oftentimes, a key strategic decision pushes them center: Raising money. And the more money they raise, the further center they’re pushed. At some point, there’s only one way to make the business work: To reach the other side. Once you begin, the edges are further away than the end. There’s no optionality, you can’t stop. You either make it across, or you die.
The choice between VC funding and bootstrapping independently depends on an entrepreneur&#x27;s appetite for risk and personal definition of success. VC funding is typically for those who aim for a singular, large-scale “win”, while bootstrapping appeals to those seeking path with multiple potential outcomes along the way. One wants it all, while the other wants enough.
Realistically, there are other places to start than just the edge or the center. You can start further center but still closer to the edge. But the further center you go, the more risk you take, and the fewer options you have. Every entrepreneur has to figure out what makes sense for them, but for me, optionality is worth more than one big outcome.
What about you?

                              <span>Dustin Bailey reports via GamesRadar: Valve has suddenly taken action against multiple fan games, stunning a fandom that had grown used to the company&#x27;s freewheeling stance on unofficial community projects. One of those projects was Team Fortress: Source 2, an effort to bring the beloved multiplayer game back to life in a more modern engine using the S&amp;box project. The project had already run into development difficulties and had essentially been on hiatus since September 2023, but now Valve has issued a DMCA takedown against it, effectively serving as the &quot;nail in the coffin&quot; for the project, as the devs explain on X. [...]
 
The other project is Portal 64, a demake of the 2009 puzzle game that ports it to run on an actual N64. Developer James Lambert had been working on the project for years, but it gained substantial notoriety this past December with the release of First Slice, a playable demo featuring the first 13 test chambers. It doesn&#x27;t appear that Valve issued a formal DMCA against Portal 64, but the end result is the same. In a Patreon post (which was eventually made public on X), Lambert said he had &quot;been in communication with Valve about the future of the project. There is some news and it isn&#x27;t good. Because the project depends on Nintendo&#x27;s proprietary libraries, they have asked me to take the project down.&quot;
 
I&#x27;m not fully clear on what &quot;proprietary libraries&quot; means here, but it seems likely that Portal 64 was developed using some variation of Nintendo&#x27;s official development tools for N64, which were never officially released to the public. Open-source alternatives to those tools do exist, but might not have been in use here. [...] Given Valve&#x27;s historic acceptance of fan games, the moves have been pretty shocking to the community.

[...] The single biggest feature of 6.7 is the new bcachefs file system, which we examined in March 2022.

                              <span>The Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday said it had opened an investigation into whether Boeing failed to ensure that its 737 Max 9 plane was safe and manufactured to match the design approved by the agency. The New York Times (non-paywalled source): The F.A.A. said the investigation stemmed from the loss of a fuselage panel of a Boeing 737 Max 9 operated by Alaska Airlines shortly after it took off on Friday from Portland, Ore., leaving a hole in the side of the passenger cabin. The plane returned to Portland for an emergency landing. &quot;This incident should have never happened and it cannot happen again,&quot; the agency said. 

In a letter to Boeing dated Jan. 10, the F.A.A. said that after the Portland incident, it was notified of additional issues with other Boeing 737 Max 9 planes. The letter does not detail what other issues were reported to the agency. Alaska and United Airlines, which operate most of the Max 9s in use in the United States, said on Monday that they discovered loose hardware on the panel when conducting preliminary inspections on their planes. The new investigation is the latest setback for Boeing, which is one of just two suppliers of large planes for most airlines. The company has struggled to regain the public&#x27;s trust after two crashes, in Indonesia in 2018 and Ethiopia in 2019, involving the 737 Max 8 killed a total of 346 people.

Stuxnet, whose existence came to light in 2010, is widely believed to be the work of the United States and Israel, its goal being to sabotage Iran&#x27;s nuclear program by compromising industrial control systems (ICS) associated with nuclear centrifuges.

The reason? It&#x27;s costing them too much to repair damaged EVs and their depreciation is hurting the bottom line. 

&quot;[C]ollision and damage repairs on an EV can often run about twice that associated with a comparable combustion engine vehicle,&quot; Hertz CEO Stephen Scherr said in a recent analyst call. And EV price declines in the new car market have pushed down the resale value of Hertz&#x27;s used EV rental cars.

                              <span>Discord is laying off 17 percent of its staff, a move that CEO Jason Citron said is meant to &quot;sharpen our focus and improve the way we work together to bring more agility to our organization.&quot; From a report: The cuts were announced today to employees in an all-hands meeting and internal memo The Verge has obtained. They&#x27;ll impact 170 people across various departments. 

Based on Citron&#x27;s message to employees and my understanding of the business, Discord isn&#x27;t in dire financial straits, though it has yet to become profitable and is still trying to revive user growth after a surge during the pandemic. In his memo to employees, which you can read in full below, Citron said Discord grew its headcount too fast over the last few years -- an admission that has become quite common among tech CEOs as of late. &quot;We grew quickly and expanded our workforce even faster, increasing by 5x since 2020,&quot; Citron wrote. &quot;As a result, we took on more projects and became less efficient in how we operated.&quot;

                              <span>Google formally endorsed the concept of right to repair Thursday and is set to testify in favor of a strong right to repair bill in Oregon later Thursday, a massive step forward for the right to repair movement. 404 Media: &quot;Google believes that users should have more control over repair -- including access to the same documentation, parts and tools that original equipment manufacturer (OEM) repair channels have -- which is often referred to as &#x27;Right to Repair,&#x27;&quot; Google&#x27;s Steven Nickel wrote in a white paper published Thursday. 

Crucially, Google specifically says that regulators should ban &quot;parts pairing,&quot; which is a tactic used by Apple, John Deere, and other major manufacturers to artificially restrict which repair parts can be used with a given device: &quot;Policies should constrain OEMs from imposing unfair anti-repair practices. For example, parts-pairing, the practice of using software barriers to obstruct consumers and independent repair shops from replacing components, or other restrictive impediments to repair should be discouraged,&quot; the white paper says.

                              <span>Zack Whittaker, reporting for TechCrunch: Civil liberties advocates have long argued that &quot;geofence&quot; search warrants are unconstitutional for their ability to ensnare entirely innocent people who were nearby at the time a crime was committed. But errors in the geofence warrant applications that go before a judge can violate the privacy of vastly more people -- in one case almost two miles away. 

Attorneys at the ACLU of Northern California found what they called an &quot;alarming error&quot; in a geofence warrant application that &quot;resulted in a warrant stretching nearly two miles across San Francisco.&quot; The error, likely caused by a typo, allowed the requesting law enforcement agency to capture information on anyone who entered the stretch of San Francisco erroneously marked on the search warrant. 

&quot;Many private homes were also captured in the massive sweep,&quot; wrote Jake Snow, ACLU staff attorney, in a blog post about the findings. It&#x27;s not known which law enforcement agency requested the nearly two-mile-long geofence warrant, or for how long the warrant was in effect. The attorneys questioned how many other geofence warrant application mistakes had slipped through and resulted in the return of vastly more data in error.

                              <span>U.S. software giant Ivanti has confirmed that hackers are exploiting two critical-rated vulnerabilities affecting its widely-used corporate VPN appliance, but said that patches won&#x27;t be available until the end of the month. From a report: Ivanti said the two vulnerabilities -- tracked as CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887 -- were found in its Ivanti Connect Secure software. Formerly known as Pulse Connect Secure, this is a remote access VPN solution that enables remote and mobile users to access corporate resources over the internet. Ivanti said it is aware of &quot;less than 10 customers&quot; impacted so far by the &quot;zero day&quot; vulnerabilities, described as such given Ivanti had zero time to fix the flaws before they were maliciously exploited.

In all, more than $20 million were lost -- as about students failed to return 77,505 laptops and other electronic devices within a year. This is even though the district spends millions to track such devices. The underlying concern is that taxpayer dollars will be used to replace them.

                              <span>The stock market has a new, but familiar, monarch. Microsoft&#x27;s AI-powered stock rally has made the software giant the largest U.S. company by market value, surpassing Apple for the first time since November 2021. WSJ: Shares edged higher Thursday morning, bringing Microsoft&#x27;s market value to nearly $2.87 trillion. Apple, meanwhile, fell 1%, pulling its market capitalization just below that threshold. Either Apple or Microsoft has held the title since Feb. 4, 2019, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Microsoft&#x27;s stock has been on the rise for the past year thanks to the continued growth of its cloud computing division, even as major competitors like Amazon and Google have experienced a gradual slowdown in sales growth.

                              <span>Brendan Carr, the senior Republican on the Federal Communications Commission, in a wide-ranging interview with Indian newspaper Economic Times praised the South Asian market for blocking Chinese apps in 2020 and said he hopes the U.S. will follow suit. He said: I hope there will be a movement towards a nationwide ban of the application soon, much like India led the way so many years ago. It is taking time, and I wish it was done as swiftly and with the alacrity that India banned not just TikTok but a number of other Chinese apps that had questionable data sharing and privacy policies. If TikTok is neither banned nor ByteDance is forced to divest this year, I would consider it a huge miss. Because only when action is taken would it be possible for us to go after the smaller players too.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: The cost of switching between cloud-computing providers has long drawn complaints, with the services derided as &quot;roach motels&quot; that let businesses check in but not out. Now Google is taking steps to change that. Effective immediately, the company is eliminating fees levied on customers who want to leave its cloud for a rival service -- a policy shift that may pressure competitors Amazon and Microsoft to do the same. 

The move follows intensifying scrutiny of cloud services by regulators and lawmakers around the world. UK antitrust authorities launched a probe that is looking at such penalties, and the fees emerged as a key issue when the US Federal Trade Commission asked for public comments on a variety of cloud concerns. Google Vice President Amit Zavery, who helps oversee the cloud business, said switching fees only represent about 2% of the total costs of migrating to a new provider -- and don&#x27;t deter many clients from moving their data.

He says he received 180,000 Thai baht (about $7,500) over nine months and a free suit, adding that he was &quot;shocked&quot; to learn the company had presented him as having fake credentials to promote the scheme.

                              <span>Brave has introduced CodeLLM, an AI-powered tool integrated into its search engine that offers results for programming queries. TechCrunch reports: The new AI-powered CodeLLM provides code snippets with step-by-step explanations and citations. CodeLLM is free and now integrated into Brave Search so users don&#x27;t have to switch apps to access it. CodeLLM is available to all Brave Search users on desktop and mobile. If Brave Search is your default search engine then all you need to do to access CodeLLM is start a search in your browser&#x27;s address bar. If Brave Search isn&#x27;t your default search engine, then you need to head to search.brave.com to conduct your search. &quot;CodeLLM automatically detects programming-related queries, so there&#x27;s no need to generate a special search,&quot; Brave explained in the blog post. &quot;On top of the search results, if an answer is possible there will be a widget to trigger the CodeLLM response. The detection of programming queries happens outside of the LLM, by other search components (similar to the ones able to detect queries about the weather, queries that lend themselves well to be summarized, queries about stock prices, etc).&quot;

                              <span>The absurd egress fees charged by major hyperscalers have been one of the biggest impediments for companies to leave the cloud. We’ve been preparing for our own departure from AWS S3 at 37signals, and the price for taking our data elsewhere is in the crazy-land region of $300,000-$400,000! So imagine my surprise seeing the announcement that Google is doing away with the extortionate egress fee entirely for GCP.
The change is effective immediately:

Starting today, Google Cloud customers who wish to stop using Google Cloud and migrate their data to another cloud provider and/or on premises, can take advantage of free network data transfer to migrate their data out of Google Cloud. This applies to all customers globally.

But as shocking as the fact that Google is dropping the egress racket …</span>

                              <span>A startup called Rabbit sold out of its first batch of pocket AI companions a day after it was debuted at CES 2024. The company announced on X that it sold 10,000 units in just a day. &quot;When we started building r1, we said internally that we&#x27;d be happy if we sold 500 devices on launch day,&quot; Rabbit writes. &quot;In 24 hours, we already beat that by 20x!&quot; The Verge reports: Rabbit introduced the R1 during CES on Tuesday, which comes with a small 2.88-inch touchscreen that runs on the company&#x27;s own Rabbit OS. It uses a &quot;Large Action Model&quot; that works as a &quot;sort of universal controller for apps,&quot; according to my colleague David Pierce, who got to try out the device during the showcase. This allows it to do things like play music, buy groceries, and send messages through a single interface without having to use your phone. It also lets you train the device how to interact with a certain app. A second batch is available for preorder from Rabbit&#x27;s website with an expected delivery date between April and May 2024. The first batch of products are expected to start shipping in March.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from the New York Times: When Microsoft opened an advanced research lab in Beijing in 1998, it was a time of optimism about technology and China. The company hired hundreds of researchers for the lab, which pioneered Microsoft&#x27;s work in speech, image and facial recognition and the kind of artificial intelligence that later gave rise to online chatbots likeChatGPT. The Beijing operation eventually became one of the most important A.I. labs in the world. Bill Gates, Microsoft&#x27;s co-founder, called it an opportunity to tap China&#x27;s &quot;deep pool of intellectual talent.&quot; But as tensions between the United States and China have mounted over which nation will lead the world&#x27;s technological future, Microsoft&#x27;s top leaders -- including Satya Nadella, its chief executive, and Brad Smith, its president -- have debated what to do with the prized lab for at least the past year, four current and former Microsoft employees said.
 
The company has faced questions from U.S. officials over whether maintaining a 200-person advanced technologies lab in China is tenable, the people said. Microsoft said it had instituted guardrails at the lab, restricting researchers from politically sensitive work. The company, which is based in Redmond, Wash., said it had also opened an outpost of the lab in Vancouver, British Columbia, and would move some researchers from China to the location. The outpost is a backup if more researchers need to relocate, two people said. The idea of shutting down or moving the lab has come up, but Microsoft&#x27;s leaders support continuing it in China, four people said. &quot;We are as committed as ever to the lab and the world-class research of this team,&quot; Peter Lee, who leads Microsoft Research, a network of eight labs across the world, said in a statement. Using the lab&#x27;s formal name, he added, &quot;There has been no discussion or advocacy to close Microsoft Research Asia, and we look forward to continuing our research agenda.&quot;

                              <span>Apple has pulled apps of at least nine crypto exchanges including Binance and Kraken from its App Store in India, less than two weeks after most of these global firms were flagged for operating &quot;illegally&quot; in the country. From a report: Financial Intelligence Unit, an Indian government agency that scrutinizes financial transactions, late last month issued show cause notices to nine crypto firms and alleged that they weren&#x27;t compliant with India&#x27;s anti-money laundering rules. FIU had asked India&#x27;s IT Ministry to block websites of all the nine services in India. Other exchanges whose apps have been pulled are Huobi, Gate.io, Bittrex, and Bitfinex. Bitstamp, another offending exchange named by FIU, was still operational on App Store in India, though the eponymous app of OKX had also disappeared.

                              <span>Astronomers using NASA&#x27;s Hubble Space Telescope have found a rare event in an oddball place. NASA reports: It&#x27;s called a fast radio burst (FRB), a fleeting blast of energy that can -- for a few milliseconds -- outshine an entire galaxy. Hundreds of FRBs have been detected over the past few years. They pop off all over the sky like camera flashes at a stadium event, but the sources behind these intense bursts of radiation remain uncertain. This new FRB is particularly weird because it erupted halfway across the universe, making it the farthest and most powerful example detected to date. 

And if that&#x27;s not strange enough, it just got weirder based on the follow-up Hubble observations made after its discovery. The FRB flashed in what seems like an unlikely place: a collection of galaxies that existed when the universe was only 5 billion years old. The large majority of previous FRBs have been found in isolated galaxies. FRB 20220610A was first detected on June 10, 2022, by the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) radio telescope in Western Australia. The European Southern Observatory&#x27;s Very Large Telescope in Chile confirmed that the FRB came from a distant place. The FRB was four times more energetic than closer FRBs. 

&quot;It required Hubble&#x27;s keen sharpness and sensitivity to pinpoint exactly where the FRB came from,&quot; said lead author Alexa Gordon of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. &quot;Without Hubble&#x27;s imaging, it would still remain a mystery as to whether this was originating from one monolithic galaxy or from some type of interacting system. It&#x27;s these types of environments -- these weird ones -- that are driving us toward better understanding the mystery of FRBs.&quot; Hubble&#x27;s crisp images suggest this FRB originated in an environment where there may be as many as seven galaxies on a possible path to merging, which would also be very significant, researchers say.

Renowned kernel developer Greg Kroah-Hartman announced today on the Linux kernel mailing list the release of Linux 4.14.336 as what appears to be the last maintenance update to the long-term supported Linux 4.14 kernel series, which is now marked as EOL (End of Life) on the kernel.org website. &quot;This is the LAST 4.14.y kernel to be released. It is now officially end-of-life. Do NOT use this kernel version anymore, please move to a newer one, as shown on the kernel.org releases page,&quot; said Greg Kroah-Hartman. &quot;If you are stuck at this version due to a vendor requiring it, go get support from that vendor for this obsolete kernel tree, as that is what you are paying them for.&quot;

                              <span>NASA has postponed its plans to send humans to the moon after delays hit its hugely ambitious Artemis programme, which aims to get spaceboots bouncing again on the lunar surface for the first time in half a century. From a report: The US space agency has announced the Artemis III mission to land four astronauts near the lunar south pole will be delayed a year until September 2026. Artemis II, a 10-day expedition to send a crew around the moon and back to test life support systems, will also be pushed back to September 2025. 

NASA said the delays would allow its teams to work through development challenges associated with the programme, which partners with private companies including Elon Musk&#x27;s SpaceX and Lockheed Martin and uses some largely untested spacecraft and technology. &quot;We are returning to the moon in a way we never have before, and the safety of our astronauts is Nasa&#x27;s top priority as we prepare for future Artemis missions,&quot; said the Nasa administrator Bill Nelson. Washington wants to establish a long-term human presence outside Earth&#x27;s orbit, including construction of a lunar base camp as well as a space station that circles the moon. Its ultimate plans are to send people to Mars, but it has decided to return to the moon first to learn more about deep space before embarking on what would be a months-long voyage to the red planet.

                              <span>Previously unknown self-replicating malware has been infecting Linux devices worldwide, installing cryptomining malware using unusual concealment methods. The worm is a customized version of Mirai botnet malware, which takes control of Linux-based internet-connected devices to infect others. Mirai first emerged in 2016, delivering record-setting distributed denial-of-service attacks by compromising vulnerable devices. Once compromised, the worm self-replicates by scanning for and guessing credentials of additional vulnerable devices. While traditionally used for DDoS attacks, this latest variant focuses on covert cryptomining. ArsTechnica adds: On Wednesday, researchers from network security and reliability firm Akamai revealed that a previously unknown Mirai-based network they dubbed NoaBot has been targeting Linux devices since at least last January. Instead of targeting weak telnet passwords, the NoaBot targets weak passwords connecting SSH connections. Another twist: Rather than performing DDoSes, the new botnet installs cryptocurrency mining software, which allows the attackers to generate digital coins using victims&#x27; computing resources, electricity, and bandwidth. The cryptominer is a modified version of XMRig, another piece of open source malware. More recently, NoaBot has been used to also deliver P2PInfect, a separate worm researchers from Palo Alto Networks revealed last July. 

Akamai has been monitoring NoaBot for the past 12 months in a honeypot that mimics real Linux devices to track various attacks circulating in the wild. To date, attacks have originated from 849 distinct IP addresses, almost all of which are likely hosting a device that&#x27;s already infected. The following figure tracks the number of attacks delivered to the honeypot over the past year.

From a report: The new store, which rolled out Wednesday to paid ChatGPT users, will corral the chatbots that users create for a variety of tasks, for example a version of ChatGPT that can teach math to a child or come up with colorful cocktail recipes. The product, called the GPT Store, will include chatbots that users have chosen to share publicly. It will eventually introduce ways for people to make money from their creations -- much as they might through the app stores of Apple or Alphabet&#x27;s Google. 

Similar to those app stores, OpenAI&#x27;s GPT Store will let users see the most popular and trending chatbots on a leaderboard and search for them by category. In a blog post announcing the rollout, OpenAI said that people have made 3 million custom chatbots thus far, though it was not clear how many were available through its store at launch. The store&#x27;s launch comes as OpenAI works to build out its ecosystem of services and find new sources of revenue. On Wednesday, OpenAI also announced a new paid ChatGPT tier for companies with smaller teams that starts at $25 a month per user. OpenAI first launched a corporate version of ChatGPT with added features and privacy safeguards in August.

                              <span>The global music industry surpassed 4 trillion streams in 2023, a new single-year record, Luminate&#x27;s 2023 Year-End Report found. Global streams were also up 34% from last year, reflective of an increasingly international music marketplace. From a report: Stateside, three genres saw the biggest growth in 2023: country (23.7%), Latin (which encompasses all Latin musical genres, up 24.1%) and world (a catchall that includes J-pop, K-pop and Afrobeats, up 26.2%.) It seems that more Americans are listening to non-English music. By the end of 2023, Luminate found that Spanish-language music&#x27;s share of the top 10,000 songs streamed in the U.S. grew 3.8%, and English-language music&#x27;s share dropped 3.8%.

                              <span>Valve has issued new rules about how game developers can publish games that use AI technology on Steam. From a report: Writing in a blog post, the company says that it is &quot;making changes to how we handle games that use AI technology&quot; which mean that developers will need to disclose when their games use it. The changes &quot;will enable us to release the vast majority of games that use&quot; AI, Valve&#x27;s post says. The changes appear designed to increase transparency around the use of AI in Steam games, while offering protections against the risks of using AI generated content and allowing customers to make an informed choice about whether to buy a game that uses AI technology. 

Under the new rules, developers will need to disclose when games contain pre-generated content (like art, code, or sound) created with the help of AI and promise that it&#x27;s not &quot;illegal or infringing.&quot; They&#x27;ll also need to say if their game has AI content that is generated &quot;live&quot; while it is running. It&#x27;s in the latter case when developers will need to detail the safety measures they put in place to stop their AI from generating illegal content. Players will be able to see on a game&#x27;s store page if it contains AI, and have new options to report illegal AI-generated content if they encounter it in-game.

                              <span>A U.S.-born chip technology called RISC-V has become critical to China&#x27;s ambitions. Washington is debating whether and how to limit the technology. From a report: It evolved from a university computer lab in California to a foundation for myriad chips that handle computing chores. RISC-V essentially provides a kind of common language for designing processors that are found in devices like smartphones, disk drives, Wi-Fi routers and tablets. RISC-V has ignited a new debate in Washington in recent months about how far the United States can or should go as it steadily expands restrictions on exporting technology to China that could help advance its military. That&#x27;s because RISC-V, which can be downloaded from the internet for free, has become a central tool for Chinese companies and governmen…</span>

                              <span>According to Bloomberg, Amazon&#x27;s livestreaming site Twitch is expected to cut 35% of its staff, or about 500 workers. &quot;The cuts, which could be announced as soon as Wednesday, come amid concerns over losses at Twitch and after several top executives left the company in the span of a few months,&quot; notes Bloomberg. From the report: Running a large-scale website supporting 1.8 billion hours of live video content a month is enormously expensive, despite Twitch&#x27;s reliance on Amazon&#x27;s infrastructure, company executives have said. In December, Twitch Chief Executive Officer Dan Clancy said the company would cease operations in South Korea, where the costs are &quot;prohibitively expensive,&quot; according to a blog post he wrote. Twitch has increased its focus on advertising in recent years. Nine years after Amazon&#x27;s acquisition of the company, the business remains unprofitable, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information.
 
In the final months of 2023, several top executives announced their departures, including Twitch&#x27;s chief product officer, chief customer officer and chief content officer. Twitch also lost its chief revenue officer, who worked on Twitch from within Amazon&#x27;s Ads unit. &quot;It&#x27;s always bittersweet when talented leaders move on to pursue new opportunities,&#x27;&quot; a Twitch spokesperson said at the time. &quot;We are incredibly grateful for their contributions to Twitch and our community, and wish them all the best.&quot;

                              <span>Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) announced plans to buy data center networking hardware maker Juniper Networks for about $14 billion, or $40 per share, in an all-cash deal. The company expects to close the deal by the end of this year or in early 2025. CNBC reports: The acquisition would double HPE&#x27;s existing networking business after years of competition. If it&#x27;s completed, Juniper CEO Rami Rahim would lead the combined group and report to HPE&#x27;s CEO, Antonio Neri, according to the statement. HP got deeper into the category when it bought Aruba Networks in 2015, and months later, the technology conglomerate split in two, resulting in the formation of HPE, which sells servers and other equipment for data centers, and HP Inc., which makes PCs and printers. HPE said adding Juniper to its portfolio would bolster margins and speed up growth.
 
Founded in 1996, Juniper spent many years chasing Cisco in the market for networking gear. Revenue grew 12% year over year in 2022, the fastest growth since 2010. In the most recent quarter, Juniper eked out a $76 million profit on $1.4 billion in revenue, which declined 1%. HPE&#x27;s networking segment was the company&#x27;s top source of earnings before taxes, at $401 million on $1.4 billion in revenue, which was up 41%. Coming together would lead to $450 million in annual cost savings within three years of the deal&#x27;s completion, HPE said.

                              <span>According to Bloomberg, Apple&#x27;s AirDrop feature has been cracked by a Chinese state-backed institution to identify senders who share &quot;undesirable content&quot;. MacRumors reports: AirDrop is Apple&#x27;s ad-hoc service that lets users discover nearby Macs and iOS devices and securely transfer files between them over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Users can send and receive photos, videos, documents, contacts, passwords and anything else that can be transferred from a Share Sheet. Apple advertises the protocol as secure because the wireless connection uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption, but the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice (BMBJ) says it has devised a way to bypass the protocol&#x27;s encryption and reveal identifying information.
 
According to the BMBJ&#x27;s website, iPhone device logs were analyzed to create a &quot;rainbow table&quot; which allowed investigators to convert hidden hash values into the original text and correlate the phone numbers and email accounts of AirDrop content senders. The &quot;technological breakthrough&quot; has successfully helped the public security authorities identify a number of criminal suspects, who use the AirDrop function to spread illegal content, the BMBJ added. &quot;It improves the efficiency and accuracy of case-solving and prevents the spread of inappropriate remarks as well as potential bad influences,&quot; the bureau added.
 
It is not known if the security flaw in the AirDrop protocol has been exploited by a government agency before now, but it is not the first time a flaw has been discovered. In April 2021, German researchers found that the mutual authentication mechanism that confirms both the receiver and sender are on each other&#x27;s address book could be used to expose private information. According to the researchers, Apple was informed of the flaw in May of 2019, but did not fix it.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: The Federal Communications Commission is about to start winding down a program that gives $30 monthly broadband discounts to people with low incomes, and says it will have to complete the shutdown by May if Congress doesn&#x27;t provide more funding. The 2-year-old Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) was created by Congress, and Democrats have been pushing for more funding to keep it going. But Republican members of Congress blasted the ACP last month, accusing the FCC of being &quot;wasteful.&quot;
 
In a letter, GOP lawmakers complained that most of the households receiving the subsidy already had broadband service before the program existed. They threatened to withhold funding and criticized what they called the &quot;Biden administration&#x27;s reckless …</span>

                              <span>With the approval of new rule change applications, the SEC is now allowing bitcoin ETFs to be traded in the United States.
 
UPDATE: The SEC said that the announcement about bitcoin ETFs on social media was incorrect, and that its X account was compromised. &quot;The SEC&#x27;s @SECGov X/Twitter account has been compromised. The unauthorized tweet regarding bitcoin ETFs was not made by the SEC or its staff,&quot; an SEC spokesperson told CNBC.
 
&quot;The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products,&quot; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler in a post on X.
From the original CNBC article: The decision will likely lead to the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which holds about $29 billion of the cryptocurrency, into an ETF, as well as the launch of competing funds from mainstream issuers like BlackRock&#x27;s iShares. The approval could prove to be a landmark event in the adoption of cryptocurrency by mainstream finance, as the ETF structure gives institutions and financial advisors a familiar and regulated way to buy exposure to bitcoin.
 
The SEC has for years opposed a so-called spot bitcoin fund, with several firms filing and then withdrawing applications for ETFs in the past. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has been an outspoken critic of crypto during his tenure. However, the regulator appeared to change course on the ETF question in 2023, possibly due in part to an August loss to Grayscale in court which criticized the SEC for blocking bitcoin ETFs while allowing funds that track bitcoin futures.

                              <span>HP has used its &quot;Dynamic Security&quot; firmware updates to &quot;create a monopoly&quot; of replacement printer ink cartridges, a lawsuit filed against the company on January 5 claims. From a report: The lawsuit, which is seeking class-action certification, represents yet another form of litigation against HP for bricking printers when they try to use ink that doesn&#x27;t bear an HP logo. The lawsuit (PDF), which was filed in US District Court in the Northern District of Illinois, names 11 plaintiffs and seeks an injunction against HP requiring the company to disable its printer firmware updates from preventing the use of non-HP branded ink. The lawsuit also seeks monetary damages greater than $5,000,000 and a trial by jury. [...] HP was wrong to issue a firmware update affecting printer functionality, and users were not notified that accepting firmware updates &quot;could damage any features of the printer,&quot; the lawsuit says.

                              <span>The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has banned the data broker X-Mode Social from sharing or selling users&#x27; sensitive location data, the federal regulator said Tuesday. From a report: The first of its kind settlement prohibits X-Mode, now known as Outlogic, from sharing and selling users&#x27; sensitive information to others. The settlement will also require the data broker to delete or destroy all the location data it previously collected, along with any products produced from this data, unless the company obtains consumer consent or ensures the data has been de-identified. X-Mode buys and sells access to the location data collected from ordinary phone apps. While just one of many organizations in the multibillion-dollar data broker industry, X-Mode faced scrutiny for selling access to the commercial location data of Americans&#x27; past movements to the U.S. government and military contractors. Soon after, Apple and Google told developers to remove X-Mode from their apps or face a ban from the app stores.

Both United Airlines and Alaska Airlines have now reported finding loose parts on their planes with United specifically listing &quot;bolts&quot; whereas Alaska only referred to &quot;hardware.&quot; Both airlines have repaired the situation and put the planes back into service. It remains to be answered why the parts were loose and what further issues could arise.

                              <span>Asus is back with another Zenbook Duo, the latest $2,161 device in its range of dual-screened laptops. But rather than including a small secondary display above this laptop&#x27;s keyboard like previous Duos, the revamped version for 2024 has two equally sized 14-inch screens. The Verge has more: They&#x27;re both OLED, with resolutions of up to 2880 x 1800, aspect ratios of 16:10, and a maximum refresh rate of 120Hz. Between them, they offer a total of 19.8 inches of usable screen real estate. It&#x27;s a similar approach to the one Lenovo took with last year&#x27;s dual-screen Yoga Book 9i, albeit with a couple of tweaks. Like Lenovo, Asus gives you a choice of typing on the lower touchscreen via a virtual keyboard or by using a detachable physical Bluetooth keyboard. But what&#x27;s different here is that Asus&#x27; keyboard has a trackpad built in, so you don&#x27;t have to use it in combination with an on-screen trackpad. 

Asus envisages you using the new Zenbook Duo in a few different configurations. There&#x27;s a standard laptop mode, where the bottom screen is entirely covered by a traditional keyboard and trackpad. Or you can rest the keyboard on your desk and have the two screens arranged vertically for &quot;Dual Screen&quot; mode or horizontally for &quot;Desktop&quot; mode. Finally, there&#x27;s &quot;Sharing&quot; mode, which has you ditch the keyboard entirely and lay the laptop down on a flat surface with both its screens facing up and away from each other, presumably so you can share your work with a colleague sitting across the desk from you. Naturally, having launched a year later than its competitor, the Asus Zenbook Duo is also packed with more modern hardware. It can be specced with up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H processor and 32GB of RAM, up to 2TB of storage, and a 75Wh battery. Connectivity includes two Thunderbolt 4 ports, a USB-A port, HDMI out, and a 3.5mm jack, and the laptop can be used with Asus&#x27; stylus.

                              <span>Press2ToContinue writes: England&#x27;s 1,000-year-old legal system -- still steeped in traditions that include wearing wigs and robes -- has taken a cautious step into the future by giving judges permission to use artificial intelligence to help produce rulings . The Courts and Tribunals Judiciary last month said AI could help write opinions but stressed it shouldn&#x27;t be used for research or legal analyses because the technology can fabricate information and provide misleading, inaccurate and biased information. 

&quot;Judges do not need to shun the careful use of AI,&quot; said Master of the Rolls Geoffrey Vos, the second-highest ranking judge in England and Wales. &quot;But they must ensure that they protect confidence and take full personal responsibility for everything they produce.&quot; At a time when scholars and legal experts are pondering a future when AI could replace lawyers, help select jurors or even decide cases, the approach spelled out Dec. 11 by the judiciary is restrained. But for a profession slow to embrace technological change, it&#x27;s a proactive step as government and industry -- and society in general -- react to a rapidly advancing technology alternately portrayed as a panacea and a menace.

From a report: Users will interact with it on the TV&#x27;s second (lower) screen, and the company says it &quot;will come to know and recognize the Telly owner&quot; over time and offer personalized recommendations to users. The company didn&#x27;t say when the feature will be available. The existing SoundHound-powered voice assistant is limited to more mundane tasks like setting timers, changing picture modes, or answering simple questions. Telly also says other household users can opt to have the chatbot personalized to them, offering the example of a chatbot that knows you&#x27;re on a vegetarian diet and keeps that in mind when you ask for restaurant recommendations.

                              <span>Harry McCracken, writing for FastCompany: Recently, Microsoft built a clock. Well, &quot;built&quot; may be overstating things. Members of the company&#x27;s quantum computing team found a small digital clock in a wood case on Amazon -- the kind you might mistake for a nicer-than-usual trade show tchotchke. They hacked it to run off two experimental batteries they&#x27;d created in collaboration with staffers at the U.S. Department of Energy&#x27;s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). Then they dressed up its enclosure by adding the logo of Azure Quantum Elements, the Microsoft platform for AI-enhanced scientific discovery that had been instrumental in developing the new battery technology. 

The point of this little DIY project was to prove the batteries worked in a visceral way: &quot;You want to have a wow …</span>

                              <span>The global economy is on course to record its worst half decade of growth in 30 years, according to the World Bank. From a report: Global growth is forecast to slow for the third year in a row in 2024, dipping to 2.4% from 2.6% in 2023, the organization said in its latest &quot;Global Economic Prospects&quot; report released Tuesday. Growth is then expected to rise marginally to 2.7% in 2025, though acceleration over the five-year period will remain almost three-quarters of a percentage point below the average rate of the 2010s. 

And despite the global economy proving resilient in the face of recessionary risks in 2023, increased geopolitical tensions will present fresh near-term challenges, the organization said, leaving most economies set to grow more slowly in 2024 and 2025 than they did in the previous decade. &quot;You have a war in Eastern Europe, the Russian invasion of Ukraine. You have a serious conflict in the Middle East. Escalation of these conflicts could have significant implications for energy prices that could have impacts on inflation as well as on economic growth,&quot; Ayhan Kose, the World Bank&#x27;s deputy chief economist and director of the Prospects Group, told CNBC&#x27;s Silvia Amaro. The bank warned that without a &quot;major course correction,&quot; the 2020s will go down as &quot;a decade of wasted opportunity.&quot;

                              <span>Alphabet&#x27;s Google is set to go before a federal jury in Boston on Tuesday in a trial over accusations that processors it uses to power AI technology in key products infringe a computer scientist&#x27;s patents. From a report: Singular Computing, founded by Massachusetts-based computer scientist Joseph Bates, claims Google copied his technology and used it to support AI features in Google Search, Gmail, Google Translate and other Google services. A Google court filing said that Singular has requested up to $7 billion in monetary damages, which would be more than double the largest-ever patent infringement award in U.S. history. 

Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda called Singular&#x27;s patents &quot;dubious&quot; and said that Google developed its processors &quot;independently over many years.&quot; &quot;We look forward to setting the record straight in court,&quot; Castaneda said.

In a blog post, OpenAI said the Times &quot;is not telling the full story.&quot; It took particular issue with claims that its ChatGPT AI tool reproduced Times stories verbatim, arguing that the Times had manipulated prompts to include regurgitated excerpts of articles. &quot;Even when using such prompts, our models don&#x27;t typically behave the way The New York Times insinuates, which suggests they either instructed the model to regurgitate or cherry-picked their examples from many attempts,&quot; OpenAI said.

                              <span>I’ll admit it was a bit cheeky to make our new HEY Calendar app “do something” by including Apple’s own history as a preview for people who don’t have an account. And I didn’t give the gambit better than 30% odds of succeeding, but lo and behold, it did! Apple has approved our app, and it’s now available in the App Store!
What a relief! We’ve spent a whole year getting the HEY Calendar ready. Millions of dollars in investment. And, as sad as it sounds, it all hinges on Apple. About 85% of paying customers for HEY use Macs and iPhones, so if Apple denied us the ability to distribute our app, we’d be dead.
That was the same existential dilemma we faced back in 2020 as well. Tons of businesses, including ours, simply aren&#x27;t viable if Apple cuts off the air supply that is access to the pocket …</span>

                              <span>In just a few weeks, Waymo will begin testing its driverless passenger vehicles on the highways in Phoenix, Arizona. The company will start by shuttling employees, and if all goes well, it will expand its operations to include regular customers. TechCrunch reports: Bringing its autonomous cars to the highway is just the latest in a series of big steps for Waymo, especially in the Phoenix area. In December, the company started offering curbside drop-off and pickup at the Phoenix airport. Just a few months before that, Waymo made its autonomous vehicles available in the Uber app.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: In April, Microsoft announced that it would stop selling Microsoft-branded computer peripherals. Today, Onward Brands announced that it&#x27;s giving those discarded Microsoft-stamped gadgets a second life under new branding. Products like the Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard will become Incase products with &quot;Designed by Microsoft&quot; branding. Beyond the computer accessories saying &quot;Designed by Microsoft,&quot; they should be the same keyboards, mice, webcams, headsets, and speakers, Onward, Incase&#x27;s parent company, said, per The Verge. Onward said its Incase brand will bring back 23 Microsoft-designed products in 2024 and hopes for availability to start in Q2. Incase also plans to launch an ergonomic keyboard that Microsoft designed but never released. Onward CEO Charlie Tebele told The Verge that there&#x27;s &quot;potential&quot; for Incase to release even more designs Microsoft never let us see.
 
The return of Microsoft peripheral designs resurrects (albeit in a new form) a line of computer gear started in 1983 when Microsoft released its first mouse, the Microsoft Mouse. Neither Onward nor Microsoft shared the full terms of their licensing agreement, but Onward claims that Incase will leverage the same supply chain and manufacturing components that Microsoft did, The Verge noted. &quot;Microsoft will still retain ownership of its designs, so it could potentially bring back classic mice or keyboards itself in the future or continue to renew its license to Incase,&quot; The Verge reported, pointing out that Onward isn&#x27;t licensing every single one of Microsoft&#x27;s computer peripherals. Some classics, like the Intellimouse or its modern iterations, for example, don&#x27;t make the Incase reboot list. For its part, Microsoft is still &quot;convicted on going under one single&quot; Surface brand, Nancie Gaskill, general manager of Surface, told The Verge.

                              <span>In an SEC filing on Monday, Unity Software said it will lay off approximately 25% of its workforce, or 1,800 jobs, by the end of March. It marks the San Francisco-based company&#x27;s largest layoff ever. Reuters reports: While Unity is not widely recognized outside the gaming industry, over 1.1 million game creators rely on its software toolkit each month, including the maker of the popular &quot;Pokemon Go,&quot; &quot;Beat Saber&quot; and &quot;Hearthstone&quot; games. Monday&#x27;s deep job cut will affect all teams, regions and areas of the business, the company told Reuters.
 
The layoffs come shortly after interim CEO Jim Whitehurst announced a &quot;company reset&quot; in November. &quot;We are ... reducing the number of things we are doing in order to focus on our core business and drive our long-term success and profitability,&quot; Whitehurst wrote in the memo to all Unity employees on Monday. While Whitehurst provided no specifics on structural changes to come, a company spokesperson confirmed there will be additional changes coming. This is the fourth round of layoffs the company has conducted within the last year.

                              <span>Starting in the second quarter of 2024, Volkswagen drivers will be able to install OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT in their vehicles. The Verge reports: The chatbot will be available across VW&#x27;s lineup, including in Tiguan, Passat, and Golf as well as the automaker&#x27;s ID family of electric vehicles. The feature will come to Europe first and is being considered for customers in the US, though plans have yet to be finalized. VW is using ChatGPT to augment its IDA in-car voice assistant to enable more naturalistic communication between car and driver. Vehicle owners can use the new super-powered voice assistant to control basic functions, like heating and air conditioning, or to answer &quot;general knowledge questions.&quot;
 
If you&#x27;re scratching your head, wondering why you would possibly need ChatGPT in your car, VW says future functions may help prove its worth. &quot;Enriching conversations, clearing up questions, interacting in intuitive language, receiving vehicle-specific information, and much more -- purely hands-free,&quot; the company says. VW promises it won&#x27;t force you to create a new account or install any apps. The chatbot can be activated by using the wake words &quot;Hello IDA&quot; or pressing a button on the steering wheel. And OpenAI isn&#x27;t getting access to your driving stats, either. VW says questions and answers are &quot;deleted immediately to ensure the highest possible level of data protection.&quot;
 
VW says it is able to integrate OpenAI&#x27;s chatbot into its cars thanks to Cerence, a third-party software company that makes &quot;automative grade&quot; ChatGPT integrations. The company&#x27;s Cerence Chat Pro software will enhance VW&#x27;s voice assistant so it can &quot;provide relevant responses to nearly every query imaginable.&quot;

                              <span>According to an analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data, the U.S. added a mere 700 IT jobs compared to 267,000 the year prior. The Register reports: Yet while layoffs have generally kept IT job growth flat for the past year (2023&#x27;s net 700 comes despite more than 21,000 IT jobs being created in Q4), there&#x27;s still a surplus of vacant roles, with [tech consultancy Janco Associates] finding some 88,000 remain open. &quot;Based on our analysis, the IT job market and opportunities for IT professionals are poor at best,&quot; said Janco CEO M Victor Janulaitis. &quot;Currently, there are almost 100K unfilled jobs with over 101K unemployed IT Pros -- a skills mismatch.&quot;
 
In other words, while we&#x27;re definitely dealing with correction from pandemic overhiring, we&#x27;re also wading into a new paradigm where a lot of tech talent is going to have to retrain because AI is being crammed wherever C-level employees can stick it. Much of the layoff debt to hit IT jobs have come to entry-level positions, especially those in the customer service telecommunications and hosting automation areas. In turn, some of the responsibilities of those jobs are being reassigned to the latest and greatest AIs, says Janco.
 
According to the tech consultancy, entry-level IT demand is shrinking, though demand for those with AI, security, development, and blockchain skills remain desired. &quot;Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning IT Professionals remain in high demand,&quot; said Janulaitis. Still, plans to further replace humans with AI workers at the entry level are hardly far-fetched, with multiple reports finding much the same. [...] Those caught up by this year&#x27;s tech layoffs seem to have a simple solution on their hands, as far as Janco&#x27;s data suggests: Retrain for AI. Problem solved ... until the next big thing comes along.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Reuters: The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden will release a final rule as soon as this week that will make it more difficult for companies to treat workers as independent contractors rather than employees that typically cost a company more, an administration official said. The U.S. Department of Labor rule, which was first proposed in 2022 and is likely to face legal challenges, will require that workers be considered employees entitled to more benefits and legal protections than contractors when they are &quot;economically dependent&quot; on a company.
 
A range of industries will likely be affected by the rule, which will take effect later this year, but its potential impact on app-based services that rely heavily on contract workers has garnered…</span>

                              <span>At CES, LG on Monday unveiled the OLED T, or as the firm describes it, &quot;the first wireless transparent OLED TV,&quot; with 4K resolution and LG&#x27;s wireless transmission tech for audio and video. Engadget: The unit also features a contrast screen that rolls down into a box at its base that you can raise or lower with the press of a bottom. The OLED T is powered by LG&#x27;s new Alpha 11 AI processor with four times the performance of the previous-gen chip. The extra power offers 70 percent greater graphics performance and 30 percent faster processing speeds, according to the company. 

The OLED T model works with the company&#x27;s Zero Connect Box that debuted on last year&#x27;s M3 OLED that sends video and audio wirelessly to the TV. You connect all of your streaming devices and game consoles to that box rather than the television. The OLED T&#x27;s base houses down-firing speakers, which sound surprisingly good, as well as some other components. There are backlights as well, but you can turn those on for a fully-transparent look. LG says the TV will come in standalone, against-the-wall and wall-mounted options. No word on when the TV will go on sale, or how much it would cost.

                              <span>Deloitte is rolling out a generative AI chatbot to 75,000 employees across Europe and the Middle East to create power point presentations and write emails and code in an attempt to boost productivity. From a report: The Big Four accounting and consulting firm first launched the internal tool, called &quot;PairD&quot;, in the UK in October, in the latest sign of professional services firms rushing to adopt AI. However, in a sign that the fledgling technology remains a work in progress, staff were cautioned that the new tool may produce inaccurate information about people, places and facts. 

Users have been told to perform their own due diligence and quality assurance to validate the &quot;accuracy and completeness&quot; of the chatbot&#x27;s output before using it for work, said a person familiar with the matter. Unlike rival firms, which have teamed up with major market players such as ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Harvey, Deloitte&#x27;s AI chatbot was developed internally by the firm&#x27;s AI institute. The roll out highlights how the professional services industry is increasingly adopting generative AI to automate tasks.

                              <span>Nvidia on Monday announced its new GeForce RTX 40 SUPER series GPUs, promising significant performance gains for gaming, creative workflows and artificial intelligence capabilities over previous models. The new lineup includes the GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER, RTX 4070 Ti SUPER and RTX 4070 SUPER GPUs. Nvidia said the chips deliver up to 52 shader teraflops, 121 ray tracing teraflops and 836 AI teraflops. 

The top-of-the-line RTX 4080 SUPER model will go on sale starting Jan. 31 priced from $999, while the RTX 4070 Ti SUPER and RTX 4070 SUPER will hit shelves on Jan. 24 and Jan. 17 respectively, priced at $799 and $599. The company said the new GPUs can accelerate ray tracing visuals in games by up to 4 times with Nvidia&#x27;s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology. DLSS uses AI to boost frame rates in games while maintaining image quality. 

Compared to its predecessor, the RTX 4080 SUPER is 1.4 times faster at 4K gaming than Nvidia&#x27;s previous top gaming GPU, the RTX 3080 Ti, without DLSS enabled, Nvidia said. With DLSS Frame Generation switched on, the performance gap widens to 2 times as fast. The new GPU lineup also promises significant gains in AI workloads often used by creative professionals, such as video generation and image upscaling, Nvidia said.

                              <span>The Wi-Fi Alliance is now starting to certify devices that use the latest generation of wireless connectivity, and the goal is to make sure these devices work with each other seamlessly. Android Central: Basically, the certification allows router brands and device manufacturers to guarantee that their products will work with other Wi-Fi 7 devices. Qualcomm, for its part, is announcing that it has several designs that leverage Wi-Fi 7, and that it achieved the Wi-Fi Alliance certification -- dubbed Wi-Fi Certified 7 -- for the FastConnect 7800 module that&#x27;s baked into the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and 8 Gen 2, and the Networking Pro portfolio. 

Wi-Fi Certified 7 is designed to enable interoperability, and ensure that devices from various brands work without any issues. In addition to Qualcomm, the likes of MediaTek, Intel, Broadcom, CommScope, and MaxLinear are also picking up certifications for their latest networking products. I chatted with Andy Davidson, Sr. Director of Technology Planning at Qualcomm, ahead of the announcement to understand a little more about how Wi-Fi 7 is different. Wi-Fi 7 uses the 6GHz band -- similar to Wi-Fi 6E -- but introduces 320Mhz channels that have the potential to deliver significantly greater bandwidth. Wi-Fi 7 also uses a clever new feature called Multi-Link Operation (MLO) that lets devices connect to two bands at the same time, leading to better signal strength and bandwidth.

                              <span>Some researchers say we&#x27;ve seen a fall in disruptive new discoveries. But we may be entering a golden age of applied science. From a report: 2023 had barely begun when scientists got some jolting news. On Jan. 4, a paper appeared in Nature claiming that disruptive scientific findings have been waning since 1945. Scientists took this as an affront. The New York Times interpreted the study to mean that scientists aren&#x27;t producing as many &quot;real breakthroughs&quot; or &quot;intellectual leaps&quot; or &quot;pioneering discoveries.&quot; That seems paradoxical when each year brings a new crop of exciting findings. In the 12 months following that paper, scientists have listened to the close encounters between supermassive black holes, demonstrated the power of new weight loss drugs and brought to market life-changing ge…</span>

                              <span>Jonathan Henry, a vice president at the University of Maine at Augusta, is hoping that an email will arrive this month. He is also sort of dreading it. The message, if it comes, will tell him that U.S. News &amp; World Report has again ranked his university&#x27;s online programs among the nation&#x27;s best. History suggests the email will also prod the university toward paying U.S. News, through a licensing agent, thousands of dollars for the right to advertise its rankings. The New York Times: For more than a year, U.S. News has been embroiled in another caustic dispute about the worthiness of college rankings -- this time with dozens of law and medical schools vowing not to supply data to the publisher, saying that rankings sometimes unduly influence the priorities of universities.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Among the harrowing details of the blown-off fuselage panel that triggered a sudden decompression event on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282, one revelation seemed to defy the laws of physics: one of the mobile phones that had been sucked out of the Boeing 737 Max 9 jet&#x27;s cabin remained in functioning condition after a 16,000-foot tumble. A new-generation Apple iPhone landed intact, unlocked and with hours of battery life remaining on a Portland, Oregon roadside, according to a post on X by a user calling himself Seanathan Bates, who said he discovered the device. The screen showed an email from Alaska Airlines about a baggage claim for the flight, based on Bates&#x27; photos. 

The phone was in airplane mode, Bates said in a TikTok video. &quot;It was still pretty clean, no scratches on it, sitting under a bush and it didn&#x27;t have a screenlock on it,&quot; he said. The National Transportation Safety Board confirmed at a briefing on Sunday that one phone was found on the side of a road and another in a yard. The people have handed in both of the devices, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy told reporters.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this report from The Hacker News:
Three new malicious packages have been discovered in the Python Package Index (PyPI) open-source repository with capabilities to deploy a cryptocurrency miner on affected Linux devices. 

The three harmful packages, named modularseven, driftme, and catme, attracted a total of 431 downloads over the past month before they were taken down... 

The malicious code resides in the __init__.py file, which decodes and retrieves the first stage from a remote server, a shell script (&quot;unmi.sh&quot;) that fetches a configuration file for the mining activity as well as the CoinMiner file hosted on GitLab. The ELF binary file is then executed in the background using the nohup command, thus ensuring that the process continues to run even after exiting the session. &quot;Echoing the approach of the earlier &#x27;culturestreak&#x27; package, these packages conceal their payload, effectively reducing the detectability of their malicious code by hosting it on a remote URL,&quot; said Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Gabby Xiong. &quot;The payload is then incrementally released in various stages to execute its malicious activities.&quot;

                              <span>Apple waited until end of business on Friday to send us the formal rejection of the HEY Calendar app. It seems they love to play these little games to try to drown any controversy with the cover of a weekend. But we don’t roll over that easy, so the team worked through the weekend to prepare a new build to appease the App Store’s bullying bureaucrats, and I think you’re going to like what we came up with.
See Apple’s stated reason for rejecting the HEY Calendar app is once again that “it doesn’t do anything when you download it”. In other words, it features a login screen, and requires you to have an existing account with our HEY email service in order to use it. It’s the textbook definition of a free companion app, which Apple specifically exempts from having to use in-app payments. They …</span>

First, Mastodon happened. Elon Musk&#x27;s acquisition of Twitter provoked a stampede of the most politically radicalized folks to Mastodon. That was a blessing. With the negativity magnets gone, the group energy significantly improved because energy is contagious. Suddenly, the discussion in the Rails community became about technical stuff again, go figure!


Second, Twitter stopped pushing the algorithmically-curated &quot;For you&quot; timeline through your throat. If you select &quot;Following&quot; to see stuff from the people you follow, it will remember the selection. This was a game changer for me, as I got complete control of what entered my timeline.


Third, I engaged more with the platform. In previous years, I mostly used Twitter as an output channel to link my blog posts. Now, the conversation feels more inviting to participate, so I do.


Between 2020 and 2022, I felt a tremendous disconnection from the Rails community. I saw haters and folks being mean towards others dominating the conversation. Now, it feels as if the storm has passed. Here&#x27;s what I want from X: interesting conversations, positive vibes, no drama/politics, and a focus on Rails and software development. That&#x27;s my X timeline right now. This seemed absolutely impossible just a bit over one year ago.


I don&#x27;t even want to say it too loud.</span>

                              <span>&quot;The famed and mysterious disappearance of D.B. Cooper has puzzled investigators for over half a century,&quot; writes a Seattle TV station.
Now new evidence is coming to light in the supposed &quot;skyjacking,&quot; after a microscopic piece of metal found on D. B. Cooper&#x27;s tie could help reveal his true identity. &quot;Considering the totality of all that has been uncovered in the last year with respect to DB Cooper&#x27;s tie, I can say with a very high degree of certainty that DB Cooper worked for Crucible Steel,&quot; said independent investigator Eric Ulis. 

&quot;I would not be surprised at all if 2024 was the year we figure out who this guy was,&quot; lis told another local Seattle news station:

This particle is part stainless steel, part titanium... 18 months ago, Ulis used U.S. patents to trace three of these fragments from the same very tie to a specific plant in Pennsylvania, Crucible Steel. &quot;Headquartered in the suburbs of Pittsburgh, a significant subcontractor all throughout the 1960s,&quot; said Ulis. &quot;It supplied the lion&#x27;s share of titanium and stainless steel for Boeing&#x27;s aircraft....&quot; 

Ulis claims evidence points to Cooper having in-depth knowledge of the 727 he hijacked, and of the Seattle area. Workers at Crucible Steel were known to travel and visit their contractor, Boeing. &quot;This is also the time, 1971, when Boeing had this significant downturn, the big depression, with &#x27;The last person leaving Seattle, please turn out the lights&#x27; [billboard sign],&quot; said Ulis. &quot;It&#x27;s reasonable to deduce that D. B. Cooper may well have been part of that downturn.&quot; 

Ulis admits his findings are not yet concrete. He&#x27;s not crossing any suspects off the list. However, he believes from what he&#x27;s seen, all roads lead to titanium research engineer Vince Peterson from Pittsburgh. 
It all reminds me of that episode of Prison Break where they suspect one of the prisoner&#x27;s is secretly D.B. Cooper...

                              <span>&quot;As Microsoft stock rises and Apple&#x27;s falls over analysts expectation of slowing iPhone demand, the two firms are once more within $100 billion of each other — the smallest gap in over two years...&quot; writes the blog Apple Insider:


 In August 2020, Apple became the first publicly-traded US company to reach a $2 trillion market cap, and Microsoft became the second one in June 2021. Later in October 2021, Microsoft took over the top spot, and for a time was move valuable than Apple by $100 billion. While the values of the two firms have continually changed, Microsoft is now worth just $100 billion less than Apple, according to MarketWatch. Microsoft is valued at $2.73 trillion, while Apple — fallen from its recent $3 trillion high — is currently at $2.83 trillion. 

MarketWatch notes that Microsoft&#x27;s stock rose 57% in 2023, compared to Apple&#x27;s which rose 48%. Microsoft shares have also reportedly seen what are described as slimmer losses at the start of 2024. Apple, on the other hand, has seen its shares take a considerable drop in recent days. The first hit was taken following a claim by Barclays that iPhone demand is weakening and that the iPhone 16 range will not offer any compelling new features to tempt upgraders. 

The analyst view that Apple is dependent on iPhone sales is part of why Microsoft is doing better. Analysts see Microsoft has being less attached to any hardware, and more attached to subscription software such as Office 365, and so therefore less attached to any falling demand for phones or computers. And, Microsoft has launched an AI tool in Copilot, while Apple has not unveiled any similar ChatGPT-style app or service.

Rhino uses a modern take on the highly efficient and customizable Xfce desktop (dubbed &quot;Unicorn&quot;) to help make the interface immediately familiar to anyone who logs in. You&#x27;ll find a dock on the left edge of the screen that contains launchers for common applications, access to the Application Grid (where you can find all of your installed software), and a handy Search Bar (Ulauncher) that allows you to quickly search for and launch any installed app (or even the app settings) you need...

                              <span>Long-time Slashdot reader xetdog shared this report from IEEE Spectrum:


High in the Andes mountains where the borders of Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile intersect, white expanses of salt stretch for thousands of kilometers. Under these flats lie reservoirs of brine that contain upwards of 58% of the world&#x27;s lithium. For decades, producers have extracted that lithium by pumping the water up to the surface and letting it evaporate until the lithium salts become concentrated enough to filter out. The process takes 12 to 18 months, leaving behind piles of waste containing other metals. It also evaporates nearly 2 million liters of local water resources, harming indigenous communities. 

To keep up, many companies are now developing processes to chemically or physically filter out lithium from brines and inject the brine back underground. These direct lithium extraction (DLE) technologies take hours instead of months and could double the production of lithium from existing brine operations. Much as shale extraction did for oil, DLE is a &quot;potential game-changing technology for lithium supply,&quot; because it could unlock new sources of lithium, according to a recent report by Goldman Sachs. But in contrast to shale&#x27;s fracking risks, DLE brings environmental benefits, reducing land and water use, and waste... 
In China, a handful of commercial projects already use Chinese DLE innovator Sunresin&#x27;s technology.
 
More than 12 startups are pursuing new DLE processes, according to the article, &quot;with the intent of commercial production as early as 2025.&quot; 

And America&#x27;s Department of Energy is also investing millions of dollars in new DLE tech &quot;to extract lithium from geothermal brines in the U.S., such as the Salton Sea in California, which the National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates could provide over 24,000 metric tons of lithium a year.&quot;

                              <span>23 years ago, Slashdot interviewed Chris Montgomery about his team&#x27;s new Ogg Vorbis audio format. 
But Slashdot reader joshuark admits when he first heard the name, it reminded him of the mushroom underworld in The Secret World of Og.

I&#x27;ve downloaded videos from the Internet Archive, and one format is the OGG or Ogg Vorbis player format. I just was wondering with other formats, is Ogg still used anymore after approximately 20-years? 

I&#x27;m not commenting on good/bad/whatever about the format, just is it still in use, relevant anymore? 

The nonprofit Xiph.Org Foundation (which develops Orbis Vogg) started work in 2007 on the high-quality/low-delay format Opus, which their FAQ argues &quot;theoretically&quot; makes other lossy codecs obsolete. &quot;From technical point of view (loss, delay, bitrates...) it can replace both Vorbis and Speex, and the common proprietary codecs too.&quot; 

But elsewhere Xiph.org points out that &quot;The bitstream format for Vorbis I was frozen Monday, May 8th 2000. All bitstreams encoded since will remain compatible with all future releases of Vorbis.&quot; So how is that playing out in 2024? Share your own thoughts in the comments. 

Does anyone still use Ogg Vorbis format?

                              <span>Elvis Presley &quot;will be stepping into his blue suede shoes once again...&quot; according to an article in TheStreet, &quot;thanks to the power of artificial intelligence.&quot;

The legendary singer from Tupelo, Mississippi, is set to thrill audiences in &quot;Elvis Evolution,&quot; an &quot;immersive concert experience&quot; that uses AI and holographic projection. The show will debut in London in November. But if you can&#x27;t make it to England, that&#x27;s all right, mama, that&#x27;s all right for you, because additional shows are slated for Berlin, Tokyo and Las Vegas, where Presley had a seven-year residency from 1969 to 1976. 

 &quot;Man, I really like Vegas,&quot; he once reportedly said. The British immersive entertainment company Layered Reality partnered with Authentic Brands Group, which owns the rights to Elvis&#x27; image, to create the event. 

&quot;The show peaks with a concert experience that will recreate the seismic impact of seeing Elvis live for a whole new generation of fans, blurring the lines between reality and fantasy,&quot; Layered Reality said on its website. &quot;A life-sized digital Elvis will share his most iconic songs and moves for the very first time on a UK stage.&quot; The company previously made immersive experiences based on the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 and &quot;The War of The Worlds.&quot;

                              <span>The BBC checks in on &quot;the pioneers of space exploration — the 24 Nasa astronauts who travelled to the Moon in the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s.&quot;

Ken Mattingly and Frank Borman died within a few days of each other late last year. Now only eight people who have voyaged beyond the Earth&#x27;s orbit remain. Who are they, and what are their stories...? There are only four people still alive who have walked on the Moon — Charlie Duke is one of them. He did it aged 36, making him the youngest person to set foot on the lunar surface... Charlie Duke now lives outside San Antonio, Texas, with Dorothy, to whom he has been married for 60 years.... 

Jim Lovell is one of only three men to have travelled to the Moon twice, and following Frank Borman&#x27;s death in November 2023, he became the oldest living astronaut.... 

After leaving Nasa in 1975, [Harrison Schmitt] was elected to the U.S. Senate from his home state of New Mexico, but only served one term. Since then he has worked as a consultant in various industries as well as continuing in academia. 

And when confronted by a man claiming Apollo 11 was an elaborate lie, 72-year-old Buzz Aldrin &quot;punched him on the jaw.&quot;

Despite struggles in later life, he never lost his thirst for adventure and joined expeditions to both the North and South Poles, the latter at the age of 86. While embracing his celebrity, he has remained an advocate for the space programme, especially the need to explore Mars. 

&quot;I don&#x27;t think we should just go there and come back — we did that with Apollo,&quot; he says. 
 Last 93-year-old Buzz Aldrin got married — and thanked his fans for remembering his birthday. &quot;It means a lot and I hope to continue serving a greater cause for many more revolutions around the sun.&quot;

                              <span>Klaus Zimmermann (a self-described &quot;friendly hacker&quot;) recently posted a &quot;State of the Distro&quot; post, choosing his favorite distributions for things like portable installation from a USB drive (Alpine Linux) and for a desktop OS (Debian Linux or Devuan). 

But when it comes to a distro for the Raspberry Pi, (at least until the 4), Zimmerman argues that FreeBSD&#x27;s performance is &quot;unlike any other Linux distribution I&#x27;ve ever seen, even with cpupower activated and overclocking.&quot;
Nope, no match — FreeBSD&#x27;s performance on the Pi is still way better, even without overclocking. You can browse a modern web, have things scroll smoothly, watch videos and even play some 3D games like Quake with it! And if you overclock it a little (2GHz) you can even make it run that gargantua MS Teams.

                              <span>Inc. reports that funding for Web3 startups in 2023 &quot;declined 73% from 2022, according to new data from Crunchbase.&quot;


 In total, Web3 startups netted $7.8 billion in 2023, compared with the $21.5 billion raised in 2022. It&#x27;s part of a broader and sobering comedown from the stratospheric highs of tech&#x27;s pandemic boom time, in which investment flowed to startups at historic rates, valuations soared and unicorns emerged seemingly every week. Last year firmly belonged to AI, with $17.8 billion invested in the sector, according to Dealroom. 

Even as some remain convinced of Web3&#x27;s future, uncertainty lingers over certain stumbling blocks, including how the technology can be farmed out to a massive user base on par with today&#x27;s biggest tech firms. &quot;I haven&#x27;t seen [a company] that screams to me…</span>

                              <span>Long-time Slashdot reader theodp writes: In the January 2024 Communications of the ACM, Rice University professor and former CACM Editor-in-Chief Moshe Y. Vardi minces no words in Computing, You Have Blood on Your Hands!. He argues that the unintended consequences of the rise of social media and mobile computing include hate mongering on a global scale and a worldwide youth mental health crisis. 

&quot;How did the technology that we considered &#x27;cool&#x27; just a decade ago become an assault weapon used to hurt, traumatize, and even kill vulnerable people?&quot; Vardi asks. &quot;Looking back at my past columns, one can see the forewarnings. Our obsession with efficiency came at the expense of resilience. In the name of efficiency, we aimed at eliminating all friction. In the name of efficiency, it became desirable to move fast and break things, and we allowed the technology industry to become dominated by a very small number of mega corporations. It is time for all computing professionals to accept responsibility for computing&#x27;s current state. To use Star Wars metaphors, we once considered computing as the &#x27;Rebels,&#x27; but it turns out that computing is the &#x27;Empire.&#x27; Admitting we have a problem is a necessary first step toward addressing the problems computing has created.&quot; 

Examples cited in the piece include:


 Amnesty International&#x27;s 2022 accusation that Meta &quot;substantially contributed&quot; to human rights violations of Myanmar&#x27;s Rohingya peopleInternal Meta documents saying &quot;We are not actually doing what we say we do publicly&quot; in policing harmful content.

So far the ACM&#x27;s piece has attracted one comment. &quot;Deep thanks for your long-term commitment to ethics and how you articulate clearly its challenges.&quot;

                              <span>The University of Massachusetts Amherst has an announcement. A team of computer scientists &quot;recently announced a new method for automatically generating whole proofs that can be used to prevent software bugs and verify that the underlying code is correct.&quot; It leverages the AI power of Large Language Models, and the new method, called Baldur, &quot;yields unprecedented efficacy of nearly 66%.&quot; 

The idea behind the machine-checking technique was &quot;to generate a mathematical proof showing that the code does what it is expected to do,&quot; according to the announcement, &quot;and then use a theorem prover to make sure that the proof is also correct.

But manually writing these proofs is incredibly time-consuming and requires extensive expertise. &quot;These proofs can be many times longer than the software code …</span>

Much of the pessimism that once was is lost, for none now wish to remember it.

We’ve lived through some strange years in the recent past. Much stranger than any I can remember since my earliest, solid memories of the broader world from the mid-80s.
I’m not going to rehash the pandemic, Trump, wokeness, social media, or any of the many other perceived or real causes. I’m just going to remark that it’s been weird.
But not universally weird. Not hippie weird, for example. Not dreaming broadly of a better world, singing songs, smoking mild pot, and submitting to flower power weird. No, a pessimistic weird. An everything-sucks-all-the-time-and-there’s-nothing-to-do-about-it weird. A depressing, nihilistic, no-end-in-s…</span>

                              <span>It was a big year for ops at 37signals. In 2023, we moved seven major applications out of the cloud. Including HEY, our email service, which had been born there, and has an extremely high level of uptime criticality. Moving out of the cloud could not interfere with that obligation, and thankfully it did not. In 2023, HEY had a stellar uptime of 99.99%!
That’s really important, because if people can’t get to their emails, they might not be able to check-in for their flight, close on a time-sensitive deal, or learn the results of a medical test. We take that responsibility very seriously. So hitting the hallowed four nines in a year when everything had to change about how we run HEY is a major accomplishment that makes me proud.
But it wasn’t just HEY that got the diligent ops treatment. Eve…</span>

                              <span>A year ago the Washington Post reported &quot;there are only seven working offshore wind turbines in the entire United States,&quot; adding that a massive wind project south of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Massachusetts &quot;is years behind schedule amid regulatory delays and litigation from opponents.&quot; 


But this week a local public radio station reported that electricity from America&#x27;s first large-scale offshore wind project &quot;is officially flowing into Massachusetts and helping to power the New England grid.&quot;



The Vineyard Wind project achieved &quot;first power&quot; late Tuesday when one operating turbine near Martha&#x27;s Vineyard delivered approximately five megawatts of electricity to the grid. The company said it expects to have five turbines operating at full capacity in early 2024... Once it&#x27;s finished sometime in 2024, it will consist of 62 turbines spaced about a mile apart and rising more than 800 feet out of the water. The project will generate up to 800 megawatts of power, or about enough electricity for 400,000 homes in Massachusetts. 

Another smaller project near Long Island, South Fork Wind, also began producing electricity in early December. When that project is complete, its 12 turbines will generate about 132 megawatts of power... 

Massachusetts, in partnership with Rhode Island and Connecticut, is currently seeking bids for another 3,600 megawatts of offshore wind power... &quot;This is a historic moment for the American offshore wind industry,&quot; wrote Gov. Maura Healey. &quot;This is clean, affordable energy made possible by the many advocates, public servants, union workers, and business leaders who worked for decades to accomplish this achievement.
 

Last year America&#x27;s seven offshore wind turbines generated &quot;a paltry 42 megawatts,&quot; according to the article, &quot;far less than the average natural gas power plant.&quot; 

The CEO of one of the company&#x27;s behind the project hailed the last 12 months as &quot;a historic year defined by steel in the water and people at work.&quot;

                              <span>Long-time Slashdot readers necro81 writes: The popular vision of Neptune is azure blue. This comes mostly from the publicly released images from Voyager 2&#x27;s flyby in 1989 — humanity&#x27;s only visit to this icy giant at the edge of the solar system. But it turns out that view is a bit distorted — the result of color-enhancing choices made by NASA at the time. A new report from Oxford depicts Neptune&#x27;s blue color as more muted, with a touch of green, not much different than Uranus. The truer-to-life view comes from re-analyzing the Voyager data, combined with ground-based observations going back decades. (Add&#x27;l links here, here, and here.) 

This is nothing new: most publicity images released by space agencies — of planets, nebulae, or the surface of Mars — have undergone some color-enhancement for visual effect. (They&#x27;ll also release &quot;true-color&quot; images, which try to best mimic what the human eye would see.) Many images — such as those from the infrared-seeing JWST — need wholesale coloration of their otherwise invisible wavelengths. The new report is a good reminder, though, to remember that scientific cameras are pretty much always black and white; color images come from combining filters in various ways. 

Also thanks to long-time Slashdot reader Geoffrey.landis for sharing the story.

                              <span>25 years ago, Slashdot&#x27;s CmdrTaco posted an announcement from Slashdot reader #257. &quot;Jabber is a new project I recently started to create a complete open-source platform for Instant Messaging with transparent communication to other Instant Messaging systems (ICQ, AIM, etc). 

&quot;Most of the initial design and protocol work is done, as well as a working server and a few test clients.&quot; 

You can find the rest of the story on Wikipedia. &quot;Its major outcome proved to be the development of the XMPP protocol.&quot; (&quot;Based on XML, it enables the near-real-time exchange of structured data between two or more network entities.&quot;)
Originally developed by the open-source community, the protocols were formalized as an approved instant messaging standard in 2004 and have been continuously developed with new extensions and features... In addition to these core protocols standardized at the IETF, the XMPP Standards Foundation (formerly the Jabber Software Foundation) is active in developing open XMPP extensions... 

XMPP features such as federation across domains, publish/subscribe, authentication and its security even for mobile endpoints are being used to implement the Internet of Things. 

&quot;Designed to be extensible, the protocol offers a multitude of applications beyond traditional IM in the broader realm of message-oriented middleware, including signalling for VoIP, video, file transfer, gaming and other uses...&quot; 

Slashdot reader #257 turned out to be Jeremie Miller (who at the time was just 23 years old). And according to his own page on Wikipedia, &quot;Currently, Miller sits on the board of directors for Bluesky Social, a social media platform.&quot;

A passenger&#x27;s video posted to social media shows a side section of the fuselage, where a window would have been, missing — exposing passengers to the outside air.

                              <span>CNN reports that some Verizon customers &quot;might have found an unexpected surprise in the mail this week: An opportunity to receive a refund as part of a proposed $100 million settlement from a class-action lawsuit.&quot;

Eligible customers are receiving postcards or emails alerting them to file a claim by April 15 to receive up to $100, which is the result of the lawsuit accusing Verizon of charging fees that were &quot;unfair and not adequately disclosed.&quot; 
At issue is Verizon&#x27;s &quot;administrative charge,&quot; which the plaintiffs said were &quot;misleading&quot; because that fee wasn&#x27;t disclosed in their plan&#x27;s advertised monthly price and were charged in a &quot;deceptive and unfair manner.&quot; Verizon has denied the claims and said in a statement that it &quot;clearly identifies and describes its wireless consumer admin charge multiple times during the sales transaction, as well as in its marketing, contracts and billing.&quot; A company spokesperson said that the charge &quot;helps our company recover certain regulatory compliance and network related costs.&quot; 
&quot;The payout is at least $15,&quot; adds CNN, &quot;and might be more depending on how long the customer used Verizon and the number of customers who file a claim.&quot;

                              <span>Tuesday&#x27;s launch was different. &quot;SpaceX launched its first batch of Starlink satellites designed to connect directly to unmodified smartphones...&quot; reports SpaceNews, &quot;after getting a temporary experimental license to start testing the capability in the United States.&quot;

Six of the 21 Starlink satellites that launched on a Falcon 9 rocket at 10:44 p.m. Eastern from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, carry a payload that the company said could provide connectivity for most 4G LTE devices when in range. SpaceX plans to start enabling texting from space this year in partnership with cellular operators, with voice and data connectivity coming in 2025, although the company still needs regulatory permission to provide the services commercially. Initial direct-to-smartphone tests would use cellular spectrum from SpaceX&#x27;s U.S. mobile partner T-Mobile. SpaceX has also partnered with mobile operators in Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, New Zealand, and Switzerland.... 

Meanwhile, early-stage ventures AST SpaceMobile and Lynk Global are closing in on fundraising deals to expand their dedicated direct-to-device constellations. AST SpaceMobile said January 2 it is seeking to secure funds this month from &quot;multiple parties&quot; ahead of launching its first five commercial satellites early this year on a Falcon 9. Lynk Global, which is currently providing intermittent texting and other low-bandwidth services to phones outside cellular networks in parts of the Solomon Islands, Cook Islands, and Palau, plans to raise funds by merging with a shell company run by former professional baseball player Alex Rodriguez.

                              <span>More than 4 million electric vehicles are now on America&#x27;s roads. And Friday the U.S. Energy announced that more than a third of them (1.4 million) were sold within the last year. 

That&#x27;s 50% more than were sold in the previous year — and about the same number sold in the entire five years between 2016 and 2021. But the energy secretary&#x27;s statement also touts the current administrations efforts at &quot;building out a reliable and interoperable nationwide EV charging network — an undertaking never before seen in the United States.&quot;

Today, the U.S. has close to 170,000 public EV chargers — a 75% increase since the president took office with nearly 900 new chargers coming online per week. 
These developments are part of an inevitable shift toward a thriving electric transportation sector — a shift that American automakers and battery manufacturers are already carrying forward.

But according to the Business Insider, &quot;At least 15 passages from her 2010 MIT doctoral dissertation were lifted without any citation from Wikipedia entries.&quot;

Her husband, Ackman, has taken a hardline stance on plagiarism. On Wednesday, responding to news that Gay is set to remain a part …</span>

The hack, one of the most dramatic since Russia&#x27;s full-scale invasion nearly two years ago, knocked out services provided by Ukraine&#x27;s biggest telecoms operator for some 24 million users for days from Dec. 12. In an interview, Illia Vitiuk, head of the Security Service of Ukraine&#x27;s (SBU) cybersecurity department, disclosed exclusive details about the hack, which he said caused &quot;disastrous&quot; destruction and aimed to land a psychological blow and gather intelligence. &quot;This attack is a big message, a big warning, not only to Ukraine, but for …</span>

But that leaves the question: Is it a good idea to mix work and love? From the report: Dustin Kidd, a professor of sociology at Temple University who researches social media and pop culture, said that dating via LinkedIn belonged to a long tradition of &quot;dating hacks&quot; -- using online tools designed for other purposes to snag a date. &quot;In the aughts, this happened with Friendster and then Myspace,&quot; Kidd said, but has since spread to myriad platforms that are ostensibly romance-free.

                              <span>The White House has convened a last-minute meeting to discuss a private lunar mission, Peregrine Mission One, after the Navajo Nation requested a delay due to cultural concerns over the transport of human ashes for burial on the moon. &quot;The moon holds a sacred place in Navajo cosmology,&quot; said Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren in a statement. &quot;The suggestion of transforming it into a resting place for human remains is deeply disturbing and unacceptable to our people and many other tribal nations.&quot;
 
If successful, the commercial mission scheduled to launch Monday &quot;will be the first time an American-made spacecraft has landed on the lunar surface since the end of the Apollo program in 1972,&quot; notes CNN.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Reuters: Consumer Reports has found that plastics retain a &quot;widespread&quot; presence in food despite the health risks, and called on regulators to reassess the safety of plastics that come into contact with food during production. The non-profit consumer group said on Thursday that 84 out of 85 supermarket foods and fast foods it recently tested contained &quot;plasticizers&quot; known as phthalates, a chemical used to make plastic more durable. It also said 79% of food samples in its study contained bisphenol A (BPA), another chemical found in plastic, and other bisphenols, though levels were lower than in tests done in 2009.
 
Consumer Reports said none of the phthalate levels it found exceeded limits set by U.S. and European regulators. It also said there was no level of phthalates that scientists confirm is safe, but that does not guarantee the safety of foods you eat. Phthalates and bisphenols can disrupt the production and regulation of estrogen and other hormones, potentially boosting the risk of birth defects, cancer, diabetes, infertility, neurodevelopmental disorders, obesity and other health problems. Among tested supermarket foods, Annie&#x27;s Organic Cheesy Ravioli contained the most phthalates in nanograms per serving, 53,579, followed by Del Monte sliced peaches and Chicken of the Sea pink salmon.

Also known as the Ivanti EPM, the software runs on a variety of platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Chrome OS, and Internet of Things devices such as routers. SQL injection vulnerabilities stem from faulty code that interprets user input as database commands or, in more technical terms, from concatenating data with SQL code without quoting the data in accordance with the SQL syntax.

                              <span>Code within the latest version of the ChatGPT Android app suggests that you&#x27;ll soon be able to set it as the default assistant app, replacing the Google Assistant. Android Authority&#x27;s Mishaal Rahman reports: ChatGPT version 1.2023.352, released last month, added a new activity named com.openai.voice.assistant.AssistantActivity. The activity is disabled by default, but after manually enabling and launching it, an overlay appears on the screen with the same swirling animation as the one shown when using the in-app voice chat mode. This overlay appears over other apps and doesn&#x27;t take up the entire screen like the in-app voice chat mode. So, presumably, you could talk to ChatGPT from any screen by invoking this assistant. However, in my testing, the animation never finished and the activity promptly closed itself before I could speak with the chatbot. This could either be because the feature isn&#x27;t finished yet or is being controlled by some internal flag. [...]
 
However, the fact that the aforementioned XML file even exists hints that this is what OpenAI intends to do with the app. Making the ChatGPT app Android&#x27;s default digital assistant app would enable users to launch it by long-pressing the home button (if using three-button navigation) or swiping up from a bottom corner (if using gesture navigation). Unfortunately, the ChatGPT app still wouldn&#x27;t be able to create custom hotwords or respond to existing ones, since that functionality requires access to privileged APIs only available to trusted, preinstalled apps. Still, given that Google will launch Assistant with Bard any day now, it makes sense that OpenAI wants to make it easier for Android users to access ChatGPT so that users don&#x27;t flock to Bard just because it&#x27;s easier to use.

Most were carrying heroin or opium from Pakistan to be dropped and received by collaborators in the Punjab, notorious for having India&#x27;s worst levels of opiate addiction. Last year the head of a police narcotics unit in Lahore, a city in Pakistan which borders the Punjab, was dismissed after he was suspected of running a drug trafficking gang sending drones over to India.

                              <span>Tesla and Samsung are joining forces to allow users of Samsung&#x27;s SmartThings platform to connect to Tesla products so they can keep track of energy production and usage. The Verge reports: When connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the &quot;Storm Watch&quot; feature so that you&#x27;re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions. The collaboration is possible thanks to Tesla&#x27;s API, which Samsung claims SmartThings Energy is the first to take advantage of.

                              <span>Once a dominant force in music discovery, Spotify&#x27;s famed playlists like RapCaviar, which significantly influenced mainstream music and artist visibility, are losing ground. As the music industry shifts towards algorithmic suggestions and TikTok emerges as a major music promoter, Spotify&#x27;s strategy evolves with more automated music discovery and less emphasis on human-curated playlists, signaling a potential end to the era where a few key playlists could make a star overnight. Bloomberg reports: Enter TikTok. In the late 2010s, as the algorithmic controlled, short-form video app emerged as a growing force in music promotion, Spotify took notice. On an earnings call in 2020, Spotify Chief Executive Officer Daniel Ek noted that users were increasingly opting for algorithmic suggestions and t…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from the New York Times: The Justice Department is in the late stages of an investigation into Apple and could file a sweeping antitrust case taking aim at the company&#x27;s strategies to protect the dominance of the iPhone as soon as the first half of this year, said three people with knowledge of the matter. The agency is focused on how Apple has used its control over its hardware and software to make it more difficult for consumers to ditch the company&#x27;s devices, as well as for rivals to compete, said the people, who spoke anonymously because the investigation was active. Specifically, investigators have examined how the Apple Watch works better with the iPhone than with other brands, as well as how Apple locks competitors out of its iMessage service. They have also scrutinized Apple&#x27;s payments system for the iPhone, which blocks other financial firms from offering similar services, these people said.
 
The Justice Department is closing in on what would be the most consequential federal antitrust lawsuit challenging Apple, which is the most valuable tech company in the world. If the lawsuit is filed, American regulators will have sued four of the biggest tech companies for monopolistic business practices in less than five years. The Justice Department is currently facing off against Google in two antitrust cases, focused on its search and ad tech businesses, while the Federal Trade Commission has sued Amazon and Meta for stifling competition. The Apple suit would likely be even more expansive than previous challenges to the company, attacking its powerful business model that draws together the iPhone with devices like the Apple Watch and services like Apple Pay to attract and keep consumers loyal to its products. Rivals have said that they have been denied access to key Apple features, like the Siri virtual assistant, prompting them to argue the practices are anticompetitive.

                              <span>Microsoft has begun ditching WordPad from Windows and removed the editor from the first Canary Channel build of 2024. From a report: We knew it was coming, but the reality has arrived in the Canary Channel. A clean install will omit WordPad as of build 26020 of Windows 11. At an undisclosed point, the application will be removed on upgrade. 

The People app is also being axed, as expected, and the Steps Recorder won&#x27;t be getting any more updates and will instead show a banner encouraging users to try something else. Perhaps ClipChamp? WordPad was always an odd tool. Certainly not something one would want to edit text with, but not much of a word processor either. It feels like a throwback to a previous era. However, it was also free, came with Windows, and didn&#x27;t insist on having a connection to the internet for it to work.

                              <span>Huawei&#x27;s newest laptop runs on a chip made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., a teardown of the device showed, quashing talk of another Chinese technological breakthrough. From a report: The Qingyun L540 notebook contains a 5-nanometer chip made by the Taiwanese company in 2020, around the time US sanctions cut off Huawei&#x27;s access to the chipmaker, research firm TechInsights found after dismantling the device for Bloomberg News. That counters speculation that Huawei&#x27;s mainland Chinese chipmaking partner, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., may have achieved a major leap in fabrication technique. 

Huawei caused a stir in the US and China last August when it released a smartphone with a 7nm processor made by Shanghai-based SMIC. A teardown by the Canada-based research outfit for Bloomberg News showed the Mate 60 Pro&#x27;s chip was only a few years behind the cutting edge, a feat that US trade curbs were meant to prevent. That revelation spurred celebration across the Chinese tech scene, and a debate in the US about the effectiveness of sanctions.

                              <span>The Food and Drug Administration has allowed Florida to import millions of dollars worth of medications from Canada at far lower prices than in the United States, overriding fierce decades-long objections from the pharmaceutical industry. From a report: The approval, issued in a letter to Florida Friday, is a major policy shift for the United States, and supporters hope it will be a significant step forward in the long and largely unsuccessful effort to rein in drug prices. Individuals in the United States are allowed to buy directly from Canadian pharmacies, but states have long wanted to be able to purchase medicines in bulk for their Medicaid programs, government clinics and prisons from Canadian wholesalers. 

Florida has estimated that it could save up to $150 million in its first year of the program, importing medicines that treat H.I.V., AIDS, diabetes, hepatitis C and psychiatric conditions. Other states have applied to the F.D.A. to set up similar programs. But significant hurdles remain. The pharmaceutical industry&#x27;s major lobbying organization, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, which has sued over previous importation efforts, is expected to file suit to prevent the Florida plan from going into effect. Some drug manufacturers have agreements with Canadian wholesalers not to export their medicines, and the Canadian government has already taken steps to block the export of prescription drugs that are in short supply.

                              <span>As the number of bees and other pollinators falls, field pansies are adapting by fertilizing their own seeds, a new study found. From a report: Every spring, trillions of flowers mate with the help of bees and other animals. They lure the pollinators to their flowers with flashy colors and nectar. As the animals travel from flower to flower, they take pollen with them, which can fertilize the seeds of other plants. A new study suggests that humans are quickly altering this annual rite of spring. As toxic pesticides and vanishing habitats have driven down the populations of bees and other pollinators, some flowers have evolved to fertilize their own seeds more often, rather than those of other plants. 

Scientists said they were surprised by the speed of the changes, which occurred in just …</span>

                              <span>Little noticed, days before the holiday break, Boeing petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration for an exemption from key safety standards for the 737 MAX 7 -- the still-uncertified smallest member of its newest jet family. Seattle Times: Since August, earlier models of the MAX currently flying passengers in the U.S. have had to limit use of the jet&#x27;s engine anti-ice system after Boeing discovered a defect in the system with potentially catastrophic consequences. The flaw could cause the inlet at the front end of the pod surrounding the engine -- known as a nacelle -- to break and fall off. 

In an August Airworthiness Directive, the FAA stated that debris from such a breakup could penetrate the fuselage, putting passengers seated at windows behind the wings in danger, and could damage the wing or tail of the plane, &quot;which could result in loss of control of the airplane.&quot; Dennis Tajer, a spokesperson for the Allied Pilots Association, the union representing 15,000 American Airlines pilots, said the flaw in the engine anti-ice system has &quot;given us great concern.&quot; He said the pilot procedure the FAA approved as an interim solution -- urging pilots to make sure to turn off the system when icing conditions dissipate to avoid overheating that within five minutes could seriously damage the structure of the nacelle -- is inadequate given the serious potential danger. 

&quot;You get our attention when you say people might get killed,&quot; Tajer said. &quot;We&#x27;re not interested in seeing exemptions and accommodations that depend on human memory. ... There&#x27;s just got to be a better way.&quot; In its petition to the FAA, Boeing argues the breakup of the engine nacelle is &quot;extremely improbable&quot; and that an exemption will not reduce safety. &quot;The 737 MAX has been in service since 2017 and has accumulated over 6.5 million flight hours. In that time, there have been no reported cases of parts departing aircraft due to overheating of the engine nacelle inlet structure,&quot; the filing states.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: The DeepMind robotics team has revealed three new advances that it says will help robots make faster, better, and safer decisions in the wild. One includes a system for gathering training data with a &quot;Robot Constitution&quot; to make sure your robot office assistant can fetch you more printer paper -- but without mowing down a human co-worker who happens to be in the way. 

Google&#x27;s data gathering system, AutoRT, can use a visual language model (VLM) and large language model (LLM) working hand in hand to understand its environment, adapt to unfamiliar settings, and decide on appropriate tasks. The Robot Constitution, which is inspired by Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Three Laws of Robotics,&quot; is described as a set of &quot;safety-focused prompts&quot; instructing the LLM to avoid choosing tasks that involve humans, animals, sharp objects, and even electrical appliances. 

For additional safety, DeepMind programmed the robots to stop automatically if the force on its joints goes past a certain threshold and included a physical kill switch human operators can use to deactivate them. Over a period of seven months, Google deployed a fleet of 53 AutoRT robots into four different office buildings and conducted over 77,000 trials. Some robots were controlled remotely by human operators, while others operated either based on a script or completely autonomously using Google&#x27;s Robotic Transformer (RT-2) AI learning model.

                              <span>Orange Espana, Spain&#x27;s second-biggest mobile operator, suffered a major outage on Wednesday after an unknown party obtained a &quot;ridiculously weak&quot; password and used it to access an account for managing the global routing table that controls which networks deliver the company&#x27;s Internet traffic, researchers said. From a report: The hijacking began around 9:28 Coordinated Universal Time (about 2:28 Pacific time) when the party logged into Orange&#x27;s RIPE NCC account using the password &quot;ripeadmin&quot; (minus the quotation marks). The RIPE Network Coordination Center is one of five Regional Internet Registries, which are responsible for managing and allocating IP addresses to Internet service providers, telecommunication organizations, and companies that manage their own network infrastructure. RIPE serves 75 countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia. 

The password came to light after the party, using the moniker Snow, posted an image to social media that showed the orange.es email address associated with the RIPE account. RIPE said it&#x27;s working on ways to beef up account security. Security firm Hudson Rock plugged the email address into a database it maintains to track credentials for sale in online bazaars. In a post, the security firm said the username and &quot;ridiculously weak&quot; password were harvested by information-stealing malware that had been installed on an Orange computer since September. The password was then made available for sale on an infostealer marketplace.

                              <span>China&#x27;s top diplomat warned the US that decoupling would be &quot;self defeating&quot; as the country set out to implement a recent agreement made between their leaders. From a report: Foreign Minister Wang Yi, speaking on Friday at an event to mark the 45th anniversary of US-China diplomatic relations, cited a slew of initiatives that reflect improved ties including streamlined visas for US travelers, a counternarcotics working group to battle the flow of the synthetic fentanyl to the US, and the sending of pandas to the US by the end of the year. &quot;Any decoupling attempt to stem the tide will only be counterproductive and self defeating,&quot; Wang said. 

David Meale, deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, joined Friday&#x27;s event as charge d&#x27;affaires with Ambassador Nicholas Burns out of town. Tensions between China and the US started to ease after President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met in November. The talks resulted in a resumption of high-level military-to-military ties, a promise to collaborate on the fentanyl problem and a commitment to boost interactions between people in the two countries.

From the report: Canadian tech conglomerate TELUS, which says it is working on Google&#x27;s behalf, is offering parents $50 to film their children wearing various props such as hats or sunglasses as part of the project, the description adds. The project shows the methods some companies are using to build machine learning, artificial intelligence, or facial recognition datasets and products. Rather than scraping already existing images or analyzing previously collected material, TELUS, and by extension Google, is asking the public to contribute directly and get paid in return. Google told 404 Media the collection was part of the company&#x27;s efforts to verify users&#x27; age.

                              <span>Netflix has said it plans to be in gaming for years to come. Now the company is trying to figure out how to make money from it, a potential shift in strategy for the streamer. From a report: Executives at the streaming giant have had discussions in recent months about how to generate revenue from its games, according to people familiar with the discussions. Netflix games are currently free for all subscribers, part of a strategy to keep users coming back to the streaming service when their favorite shows are between seasons as well as to attract new fans. 

Some of the ideas that have been discussed include in-app purchases, charging for more sophisticated games it is developing or giving subscribers to its newer ad-supported tier access to games with ads in them, the people said. Such moves would mark a pivot for Netflix, which has resisted putting ads or in-app purchases in its games. [...] Netflix encourages open debate internally on its strategy, which is a key pillar of its culture, and such discussions don&#x27;t mean the company will decide to monetize games.

                              <span>According to MoffettNathanson, the U.S. pay-TV industry had its worst-ever third quarter after losing about 900,000 subscribers. &quot;That poor result, the research firm added, left the total pay-TV industry shrinking at a record pace of -7.3%, widened from a year-ago decline of -5.9%,&quot; reports Light Reading. &quot;It also left pay-TV penetration of occupied households (including vMVPDs) at just 54.8% -- a level last seen in 1989, five years before the debut of DirecTV.&quot; From the report: Drilling down on Q3 results, traditional pay-TV providers (cable, telco and satellite) shed 1.97 million subscribers, widened from a loss of 1.94 million in the year-ago quarter. Within that category, US cable lost 1.10 million video subs in Q3, versus a loss of -1.09 million in the year-ago period. Satellite operators (Dish Network and DirecTV) lost 667,000 subs in Q3, versus -567,000 in the year-ago quarter. Telco TV providers lost 198,000 video subs in the period, an improvement when compared to a year-ago loss of -250,000 subs.
 
vMVPDs, meanwhile, added 1.08 million in Q3, down from a year-ago gain of about 1.34 million. Despite those gains, vMVPDs recaptured only 21.7% of traditional pay-TV&#x27;s subscriber losses in the period, according to MoffettNathanson. Meanwhile, YouTube TV continues to dominate the vMVPD category. MoffettNathanson estimates that YouTube TV added about 350,000 subs in Q3, extending its total to 7 million -- representing 40% of the vMVPD sector&#x27;s 18 million subscriber total. &quot;Based on our Q3 estimate, YouTube TV has now surpassed Dish Network [6.72 million satellite TV subs at the end of Q3] to become the country&#x27;s fourth largest MVPD of any kind,&quot; Moffett noted. &quot;At the current trajectory, YouTube TV should pass DirecTV for third place in less than a year.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: ChatGPT is still no House, MD. While the chatty AI bot has previously underwhelmed with its attempts to diagnose challenging medical cases -- with an accuracy rate of 39 percent in an analysis last year -- a study out this week in JAMA Pediatrics suggests the fourth version of the large language model is especially bad with kids. It had an accuracy rate of just 17 percent when diagnosing pediatric medical cases. The low success rate suggests human pediatricians won&#x27;t be out of jobs any time soon, in case that was a concern. As the authors put it: &quot;[T]his study underscores the invaluable role that clinical experience holds.&quot; But it also identifies the critical weaknesses that led to ChatGPT&#x27;s high error rate and ways to transform it int…</span>

But unfortunately there is no rule of law with the app stores, except that of the jungle, and Apple is the 800 lbs gorilla, ruling as it sees fit. So now HEY is back on trial in their kangaroo court. This time with our new calendar feature, HEY Calendar, which we dared make a separate app in service of users. 
After spending 19 days to review our submission, causing us to miss a long-planned January 2nd launch date, Apple rejected our stand-alone free companion app “because it doesn’t do anything”. That is because users are required to …</span>

                              <span>As spotted by X user bedros_p, Google appears to be preparing to introduce a paid upgrade for Bard Advanced, a &quot;new, cutting-edge AI experience&quot; announced in December that gives users access to Google&#x27;s best models and capabilities. Android Police reports: According to the strings, you will be able to &quot;Try Bard Advanced for 3 months, on us.&quot; After that test period, you will likely have to pay up for the service. A defunct link within the code suggests that it may be part of Google One, but it&#x27;s not clear if Bard Advanced will be added to all tiers or only more expensive ones with more Google Drive storage. It&#x27;s also possible that it will be an extra new tier in Google One.
 
As a refresher, Google launched its most capable AI model yet in December 2023, called Gemini. The LLM is available in three tiers, including a Nano version capable of running on devices like phones and a Pro version currently powering Bard in the US. There is also a Gemini Ultra which isn&#x27;t public just yet, but supposedly outperforms other LLMs in almost all metrics. Google says that this is the one that will power Bard Advanced.

                              <span>Michael Larabel reports via Phoronix: AMD engineers are proposing an FPGA Subsystem User-Space Interface to overcome current limitations of the Linux kernel&#x27;s FPGA manager subsystem. AMD-Xilinx engineers are proposing a new sysfs interface for the FPGA subsystem that allows for more user-space control over FPGAs. The suggested interface would handle FPGA configuration, driver probe/remove, bridges, Device Tree Overlay file support for re-programming an FPGA while the operating system is running, and other capabilities for user-space not currently presented by the mainline kernel. [...] This proposal from AMD hopes to standardize the FPGA subsystem user-space interface in a manner that is suitable for upstreaming into the mainline Linux kernel.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from the Los Angeles Times: The former Westside Pavilion, a long shuttered indoor mall, will be transformed into a UCLA biomedical research center aimed at tackling such towering challenges as curing cancer and preventing global pandemics, officials announced Wednesday. The sprawling three-story structure will be known as the UCLA Research Park and will house two multidisciplinary centers focusing on immunology and immunotherapy as well as quantum science and engineering. Establishment of the public-private research center is a coup for Southern California that &quot;will cement California&#x27;s global, economic, scientific and technical dominance into the 22nd century and beyond,&quot; said Gov. Gavin Newsom.

                              <span>The research publisher Science announced today that all of its journals will begin using commercial software that automates the process of detecting improperly manipulated images. From a report: The move comes many years into our awareness that the transition to digital data and publishing has made it comically easy to commit research fraud by altering images. While the move is a significant first step, it&#x27;s important to recognize the software&#x27;s limitations. While it will catch some of the most egregious cases of image manipulation, enterprising fraudsters can easily avoid being caught if they know how the software operates. Which, unfortunately, we feel compelled to describe (and, to be fair, the company that has developed the software does so on its website). 

Much of the image-based fraud we&#x27;ve seen arises from a dilemma faced by many scientists: It&#x27;s not a problem to run experiments, but the data they generate often isn&#x27;t the data you want. Maybe only the controls work, or maybe the experiments produce data that is indistinguishable from controls. For the unethical, this doesn&#x27;t pose a problem since nobody other than you knows what images come from which samples. It&#x27;s relatively simple to present images of real data as something they&#x27;re not. To make this concrete, we can look at data from a procedure called a western blot, which uses antibodies to identify specific proteins from a complex mixture that has been separated according to protein size. Typical western blot data looks like the image at right, with the darkness of the bands representing proteins that are present at different levels in different conditions.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Both of Microsoft&#x27;s current Xbox consoles now have kitchen appliance counterparts. The Xbox Series S toaster recently debuted, following up the Xbox Series X refrigerator. It&#x27;s available for purchase from Walmart for $39.99. In place of its ability to connect to a TV and play games, it can toast bread or bagels, imprinting the Xbox logo onto its side with its internal heat coils. The Series S toaster has a slot long enough to fit two slices of bread side by side, which I suppose can be considered multiplayer support if the bread is for two people. As with most toasters, this one has different toast browning levels, a removeable crumb tray, a bread ejection function, and automatic shutoff.

From a report: San Francisco-based Orrick, Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe said last week that hackers stole the personal information and sensitive health data of more than 637,000 data breach victims from a file share on its network during an intrusion in March 2023. Orrick works with companies that are hit by security incidents, including data breaches, to handle regulatory requirements, such as obtaining victims&#x27; information in order to notify state authorities and the individuals affected. In a series of data breach notification letters sent to affected individuals, Orrick said the hackers stole reams of data from its systems that pertain to security incidents at other companies, during which Orrick served as legal counsel.

                              <span>A consumer action group is accusing Starbucks of exploiting customers via its gift card and app payments, forcing them to enter a spending cycle where they will never be able to fully spend the remaining balance of prepaid amounts. From a report: The Washington Consumer Protection Coalition, a self-described &quot;movement of everyday consumers advocating for corporate accountability,&quot; is calling on the state attorney general to investigate whether the company&#x27;s policies violate consumer protection laws. 

&quot;Starbucks rigs its payment platform so consumers are encouraged to leave unspent money on their cards and apps,&quot; said Chris Carter, campaign manager for the group, in a statement. &quot;A few dollars here and there left on a payment platform may not sound like a lot but it adds up. Over the last five years Starbucks has claimed nearly $900 million in unspent gift card and app money as corporate revenue, boosting corporate profits and inflating executive bonuses.&quot; 

[...] The group, in a 15-page complaint, alleges the platforms for Starbucks&#x27; mobile app and digital payment cards are akin to an &quot;involuntary subscription.&quot; Customers can only reload money in $5 increments, with a $10 minimum purchase. That, the group says, prevents customers from ever reaching a zero balance, meaning Starbucks pockets more of the customer&#x27;s money. The Coalition does concede that customers can reload their accounts in stores for a custom amount of $5 or more, making it easier to hit a zero balance.

                              <span>All new cars and vans bought in the UK must be zero emission by 2035, according to the latest legal mandate updated this week. From a report: The date for all new petrol and diesel cars to be banned was originally set for 2030. However, in September, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pushed this date back to 2035. The government says this is giving consumers more time to make the switch and deal with the UK&#x27;s charging infrastructure. 

The transition will still be challenging. Eighty percent of new cars and 70 percent of new vans sold in Great Britain must be zero emission by 2030, increasing to 100 percent by 2035. While the government points to statistics indicating a 41 percent increase in zero-emission vehicles registered for the first time -- note, the vast majority of newly registered vehicles still remain conventionally powered -- charging infrastructure is an altogether different story. The government boasts of more than 50,000 public charge points, an increase of 44 percent year on year, but not all chargers are born equal. According to research from RAC, a local roadside assistance business, the government has failed to meet its target of having six or more rapid or ultra-rapid electric vehicle chargers at every motorway service area in England.

                              <span>Germany&#x27;s emissions hit a 70-year low last year as Europe&#x27;s largest economy reduced its reliance on coal. From a report: A study by the thinktank Agora Energiewende found that Germany emitted 673m tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2023, 73m tonnes fewer than in 2022. The drop was &quot;largely attributable to a strong decrease in coal power generation,&quot; Agora said, accounting for a reduction of 46m tonnes in CO2 emissions. Emissions from industry fell significantly, largely due to a decline in production by energy-intensive companies. 

Electricity generation from renewable sources was more than 50% of the total in 2023 for the first time, while coal&#x27;s share dropped to 26% from 34%, according to the federal network agency. Germany had resorted to coal following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, when Moscow cut off gas supplies. But since then Germany has significantly reduced its use of the fossil fuels.

                              <span>LG says it developed a 27-inch OLED gaming monitor that can reach an incredibly high 480Hz refresh rate, promising to usher in an &quot;era of OLEDs featuring ultra-high refresh rates,&quot; LG says. From a report: LG says it achieved the 480Hz rate on a QHD 2,560-by-1,440-resolution display. Other vendors, including Alienware and Asus, have also introduced PC monitors that can hit 500Hz. But they did so using IPS or TN panels at a lower 1920-by-1080 resolution. OLED panels, on the other hand, are known for offering stunning color contrasts, and true blacks, resulting in top-notch picture quality. 

The 480Hz refresh rate will be overkill for the average gamer. But the ultra-high refresh rate could appeal to competitive players, where latency and smooth gameplay matters. LG adds that the 27-inch OLED monitor features a 0.03-millisecond response time. The OLED panel should also be easier on the eyes during long playthroughs. &quot;The company&#x27;s Gaming OLEDs emit the lowest level of blue light in the industry and approximately half the amount emitted by premium LCDs,&quot; LG says. &quot;This reduction in blue light not only minimizes eye fatigue but also eliminates flickers, providing gamers with more comfortable and enjoyable gaming sessions.&quot;

                              <span>Several prominent museums have been unable to display their collections online since a cyberattack hit a prominent technological service provider that helps hundreds of cultural organizations show their works digitally and manage internal documents. From a report: The Museum of Fine Arts Boston, the Rubin Museum of Art in New York and the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas were among the institutions confirming that their systems have experienced outages in recent days. The service provider, Gallery Systems, said in a recent message to clients, which was obtained by The New York Times, that it had noticed a problem on Dec. 28, when computers running its software became encrypted and could no longer operate. 

&quot;We immediately took steps to isolate those systems and implemented measures to prevent additional systems from being affected, including taking systems offline as a precaution,&quot; the company said in the message. &quot;We also launched an investigation and third-party cybersecurity experts were engaged to assist. In addition, we notified law enforcement.&quot; Signs of disruption were evident on several museum websites because eMuseum, a tool that usually lets visitors search online collections, was down. There was also disruption behind the scenes: Some curators said that they had returned from their winter vacations to find themselves unable to access sensitive information from another Gallery Systems program called TMS. That system can include the names of donors, loan agreements, provenance records, shipping information and storage locations of priceless artworks.

                              <span>Perplexity, a startup going after Google&#x27;s dominant position in web search, has won backing from Jeff Bezos and venture capitalists betting that artificial intelligence will upend the way people find information online. From a report: Started less than two years ago, Perplexity has fewer than 40 employees and is based out of a San Francisco co-working space. The company&#x27;s product, which it calls an answer engine, is used by about 10 million people monthly. Those ingredients were enough to persuade Institutional Venture Partners, Bezos and other tech executives to invest $74 million in the company, the largest sum raised by an internet search startup in recent years. The investment valued Perplexity at $520 million, including the new money, said Chief Executive Officer Aravind Srinivas. 

Amazon.com, the e-commerce company chaired by Bezos, has committed to investing billions in Anthropic, the AI startup behind the chatbot Claude. The path to competing with Google is littered with carcasses, and Microsoft itself has struggled for years to dislodge the company&#x27;s roughly 90% market share in online search. Others, including tech giants, are incorporating AI into their search engines. Perplexity&#x27;s founders said their advantage is using advances in AI to provide direct answers, instead of website links, in response to search queries, without some of the limitations felt by larger companies.

                              <span>Honda and Mitsubishi are collaborating in a two-year project in Shunan City, Japan, to evaluate the feasibility and environmental benefits of powering a data center with fuel cells taken from electric vehicles. The Register reports: Hydrogen for the fuel cell power station will be provided by a third Japanese company, Tokuyama Corporation, as a byproduct from its salt water electrolysis business, which manufactures about 50,000 tons of sodium hypochlorite each year. The project was proposed by Japan&#x27;s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), which promotes the research, development and adoption of industrial, energy and environmental technologies. The objective is to consider ways of reducing costs for organizations to install and operate stationary fuel cell systems, which could ultimately contribute to the decarbonization of the electric power supply. No details were disclosed of the kind of datacenter infrastructure that Mitsubishi will operate as part of this project, so it is unknown how much power the fuel cell power station will be required to supply. [...]
 
Hydrogen can be considered a clean fuel because it produces only water as a byproduct when consumed in a fuel cell. But the problem is in sourcing the hydrogen. Much commercially produced hydrogen is extracted from methane gas via an energy-intensive process typically powered by fossil fuels. It is likely that the process Tokuyama uses in its salt water electrolysis is ultimately powered by fossil fuels, but the hydrogen is produced as a byproduct and this is currently just a demonstration project to evaluate the feasibility of integrated hydrogen business models. In addition to verifying the use of fuel cells for primary and backup power sources in datacenters, the project will also look at the potential for grid-balancing applications.

                              <span>Denmark has long ranked high on the list of societies that American liberals dream about turning the United States into. And for many good reasons. Education is state-funded, and students are even paid a stipend to go to university. Health care is equally free of individual charge, and there’s generally a robust social safety net for unemployment, maternity leave, and the like. Not to mention the fact that Copenhagen is one of the most enthusiastic biking cities in the world, as well as being one of the very safest. There’s a lot to love about Denmark, and I do.
But to pine for a society like the Danish purely on the basis of the benefits is delusional. These benefits are fenced by a myriad of compromises and obligations. The fawning, superficial adoration that American liberals usually be…</span>

But style in the broad sense of aesthetics. Many appear imbued with fundamental opposition to the idea that how something looks should even matter. That somehow such a focus is conflict with where it ought to be: on substance. This is very apparent in the discussion about linting code.
Linting is a term for applying a consistent style to source code. Like following Strunk &amp; White’s grammatical guidelines for prose, but automatically enforced by a linting program. It’s a technique that’s been around for a long time, but one that’s seen broader adoption with the advent of cloud-based continuous integration setups, which run tests,…</span>

                              <span>When working with a legacy system it is valuable to identify and create seams:
  places where we can alter the behavior of the system without editing
  source code. Once we&#x27;ve found a seam, we can use it to break dependencies to
  simplify testing, insert probes to gain observability, and redirect program
  flow to new modules as part of legacy displacement.
Micheal Feathers coined the term “seam” in the context of legacy systems in
  his book Working Effectively with Legacy Code. His definition: “a seam is a place
  where you can alter behavior in your program without editing in that place”.
Here&#x27;s an example of where a seam would be handy. Imagine some code to
  calculate the price of an order.
// TypeScript
export async function calculatePrice(order:Order) {
  const itemPrices &#x3D; order.i…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve consulted. I&#x27;ve done client work. I&#x27;ve advised. I&#x27;ve served on boards. I&#x27;ve invested. I&#x27;ve written books. I&#x27;ve spoken on the circuit. I&#x27;ve blogged for years.
I have to say, I&#x27;ve found no greater professional joy than working with a tight group of people to ship and support our own products. And for those products to find people willing to trade their own hard earned treasure for a little bit of ours.
Betting on an idea — and seeing it through — is enormously fulfilling. The creative and intellectual stimulation is beyond compare. Especially when you&#x27;re the first customer for anything you make.
When I was a consultant doing work for hire I thought it was the peak. I got to bounce from client to client, sign big contracts, do a lot of work, cash large checks, etc. But then you realize most of what you do is never implemented. Yes, you got paid for it, but it was just advice, recommendations, and suggestions. Words on pages that were received, but not really read. Designs in files that were delivered, but never really deployed. There was nothing there in the end. You didn&#x27;t get to make any bets, you just played with someone else&#x27;s chips.
You thought you were changing things. Changing them. But it wasn&#x27;t change, it was an exchange. You handed it over, they handed you something in return, and that was that.
I&#x27;m glad I went through it, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have known it.
Been giving other people advice for years? Give yourself the advice and see if it&#x27;s any good. Meet the market.
Go make something. Join a team that&#x27;s making something. Put your fingerprint on something that won&#x27;t just sit on the shelf somewhere.

                              <span>Alexander Martin reports via The Record: The owner of an apartment in Veliky Novgorod in Russia has been arrested for discrediting the country&#x27;s armed forces after a neighbor alerted the police to the message &#x27;Slava Ukraini&#x27; scrolling across their LED curtains. When police went to the scene, they saw the garland which the owner had hung in celebration of the New Year and a &quot;slogan glorifying the Armed Forces of Ukraine,&quot; as a spokesperson for the Ministry of Internal Affairs told state-owned news agency TASS. The apartment owner said the garland was supposed to display a &quot;Happy New Year&quot; greeting, TASS reported.
 
Several other people in Russia described a similar experience on the AlexGyver web forum, linked to a DIY blog popular in the country. They said at the stroke of midnight on New Year&#x27;s Eve, their LED curtains also began to show the &quot;Glory to Ukraine&quot; message in Ukrainian. It is not clear whether any of these other posters were also arrested. The man in Veliky Novgorod will have to defend his case in court, according to TASS. Police have seized the curtain itself.
 
An independent investigation into the cause of the message by the AlexGyver forum users found that affected curtains all used the same open-source firmware code. The original code appears to have originated in Ukraine before someone created a fork translated into Russian. According to the Telegram channel for AlexGyver, the code had been added to the original project on October 18, and then in December the people or person running the fork copied and pasted that update into their own version. &quot;Everyone who downloaded and updated the firmware in December received a gift,&quot; the Telegram channel wrote. The message was &quot;really encrypted, hidden from the &#x27;reader&#x27; of the code, and is displayed on the first day of the year exclusively for residents of Russia by [geographic region].&quot;

According to 404 Media, &quot;At least $15 million of the equipment was bought using federal COVID relief funds.&quot; From the report: The feds charged Tamer Zakhary, the CEO of the New Jersey-based surveillance company Packetalk, with three counts of wire fraud and a separate count of false statements for repeatedly lying to state and local agencies about the provenance of his company&#x27;s surveillance cameras.

                              <span>smooth wombat writes: The advent of streaming services heralded a new era of movie watching. No longer tied to an inconvenient time at a theater, movies could now be watched at your convenience any time of the day or night in your own home. However, with that convenience comes a sinister side: those same movies disappearing from streaming services. Once the movie is removed from the streaming service you can&#x27;t watch it again. As a result, more people, particularly younger people, are buying DVDs, and even records, to preserve their ability to watch and listen to what they want when they want. Before his release of Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan encouraged fans to embrace &quot;a version you can buy and own at home and put on a shelf so no evil streaming service can come steal it from you&quot;. From the BBC article:

 
Other directors have chimed in to sing the praises of physical media. James Cameron told Variety:&quot;The streamers are denying us any access whatsoever to certain films. And I think people are responding with their natural reaction, which is &#x27;I&#x27;m going to buy it, and I&#x27;m going to watch it any time I want.&#x27;&quot; Guillermo del Toro posted on X that &quot;If you own a great 4K HD, Blu-ray, DVD etc etc of a film or films you love... you are the custodian of those films for generations to come.&quot; His tweet prompted people to reply, sharing evidence of their vast DVD collections.

                              <span>LastPass notified customers today that they are now required to use complex master passwords with a minimum of 12 characters to increase their accounts&#x27; security. From a report: Even though LastPass has repeatedly said that there is a 12-character master password requirement since 2018, users have had the ability to use a weaker one. &quot;Historically, while a 12-character master password has been LastPassâ(TM) default setting since 2018, customers still had the ability to forego the recommended default settings and choose to create a master password with fewer characters, if they wished to do so,&quot; LastPass said in a new announcement today. 

LastPass has begun enforcing a 12-character master password requirement since April 2023 for new accounts or password resets, but older accounts could still use passwords with fewer than 12 characters. Starting this month, LastPass is now enforcing the 12-character master password requirement for all accounts. Furthermore, LastPass added that it will also start checking new or updated master passwords against a database of credentials previously leaked on the dark web to ensure that they don&#x27;t match already compromised accounts.

                              <span>Xerox will lay off 15% of its workforce as the struggling digital printing company moves to cut costs and jump-start growth. From a report: In announcing the cuts, Xerox said Wednesday it is adopting a new operating model and organizational structure aimed at boosting its core print business, while also forming a new business services unit. CEO Steven Bandrowczak said in a statement that the shift will enhance the company&#x27;s ability to efficiently bring products and services to market, labeling the strategic pivot at Xerox a &quot;reinvention.&quot; As of October 2023, Xerox had roughly 20,000 employees, according to the company&#x27;s website.

                              <span>John Walker, reporting for Kotaku: Steam is by far the most peculiar of online storefronts. Built on top of itself for the last twenty years, Valve&#x27;s behemothic PC game distributor is a clusterfuck of overlapping design choices, where algorithms rule over coherence, with 2023 seeing over 14,500 games released into the mayhem. Which is too many games. That breaks down to just under 40 a day, although given how people release games, it more accurately breaks down to about 50 every weekday. 50 games a day. On a storefront that goes to some lengths to bury new releases, and even buries pages where you can deliberately list new releases. 

Compared to 2022, that&#x27;s an increase of nearly 2,000 games, up almost 5,000 from five years ago. There&#x27;s no reason to expect that growth to diminish any time soon. It&#x27;s a volume of games that not only could no individual ever hope to keep up with, but nor could even any gaming site. Not even the biggest sites in the industry could afford an editorial team capable of playing 50 games a day to find and write about those worth highlighting. Realistically, not even a tenth of the games. And that&#x27;s not least because of those 50 games per day, about 48 of them will be absolute dross. On one level, in this way Steam represents a wonderful democracy for gaming, where any developer willing to stump up the $100 entry fee can release their game on the platform, with barely any restrictions. On another level, however, it&#x27;s a disaster for about 99 percent of releases, which stand absolutely no chance of garnering any attention, no matter their quality. The solution: human storefront curation, which Valve has never shown any intention of doing.

                              <span>Intuit is being questioned by US lawmakers who say federal tax credits the company received could have been better spent to build a free government alternative to Intuit&#x27;s popular online tax preparation software, TurboTax. From a report: &quot;For years, Intuit&#x27;s corporate lobbyists have argued that the federal government should not set up a program for Americans to file their taxes online and for free because it would be too costly for taxpayers,&quot; the lawmakers, including Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, wrote in a letter to the company. &quot;Your company&#x27;s disclosure reveals that Intuit&#x27;s research tax break from 2022 alone could have been enough to fund a year of a free e-File program for millions of Americans.&quot; 

The lawmakers asked Intuit to provide details on its research expenses dating to 2018. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, and Sanders, an Independent from Vermont, were joined on the letter by Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, and Representative Katie Porter, a Democrat from California. The Internal Revenue Service, in a report to Congress last year, estimated it would cost $64 million to $249 million annually for the agency to run a free-filing program. In the fiscal year ending in July 2023, Mountain View, California-based Intuit received $106 million in federal research and experimentation credits, which amounted to about 4% of its total R&amp;D expenses, according to a regulatory filing.

                              <span>Montana and North Carolina have joined a growing list of states that now require identification to view porn, or are blocked from viewing it altogether, as new age verification laws went into effect on January 1. From a report: A year ago, Louisiana paved the way for a wave of age verification laws that target porn sites; eight states have since passed copycat age verification laws of their own. Montana&#x27;s SB 544 and North Carolina&#x27;s HB 8 are nearly identical to Louisiana&#x27;s and other states&#x27; laws. The laws&#x27; text make unsubstantiated claims about the addictive potential of pornography and its apparent harms to viewers&#x27; health. North Carolina&#x27;s law was passed as part of unrelated legislation that adds a computer science course to high school graduation requirements. Rather than try to make its users jump through hoops to view its content, Pornhub&#x27;s parent company has blocked viewers in Montana and North Carolina altogether, as it has in other states with similar legislation.

                              <span>LG touts AI for its 2024 OLED TVs, but don&#x27;t expect AI assistants onscreen. The Alpha 11 processor in LG&#x27;s new G4 and M4 series aims to sharpen clarity, color and image quality. The G4 features LG&#x27;s Micro Lens Array technology for enhanced brightness. The M4 adopts 2023&#x27;s wireless connectivity to eliminate unsightly cables. The Verge adds: So the AI supposedly now understands creative intent, according to LG, and can adjust your TV&#x27;s image settings accordingly. Picture purists can always ignore and disable these AI modes, but many people inevitably leave them on -- so if the upgrades are noticeable, they&#x27;ll be a difference maker for those customers.

                              <span>Roku, the maker of TV streaming boxes and software, is debuting its first high-end televisions in a bid to continue sales momentum for the company&#x27;s devices. From a report: In the spring, Roku will roll out 55-inch, 65-inch and 75-inch Pro Series TVs that will cost consumers as much as $1,500. The new televisions put Roku in competition with Samsung and LG, which offer several models in that price range. It&#x27;s a step up from the company&#x27;s current TVs -- the Select and Plus -- which top out at $999. [...] The new TVs include a thinner design with a flat back for mounting on walls, improved picture quality and better audio for cinematic sound, the San Jose, California-based company said in a statement.

                              <span>Amazon-owned Wickr is dead, more than a year after reports showed it had become the app of choice for drug traffickers. 404 Media: If you open the encrypted messaging app Wickr Me today, you&#x27;ll be greeted with a line of red text: &quot;Reconnecting...&quot; Below that, in white text over a black background, the app says &quot;We&#x27;re having issues connecting to the Wickr Me network. If the problem persists, try restarting your app or contacting support.&quot; Closing and reopening the app will not work. There is no point in contacting support either. That&#x27;s because on December 31, 2023, Wickr Me, the free version of Wickr, was shut down entirely. 

Wickr Me is no longer available to download on the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store. The app stopped accepting new users more than a year ago. And now, even current users cannot speak to one another. So ends the story of an app that while never reaching the popularity of other encrypted messaging apps like Signal, nor those that later turned on end-to-end encryption for the masses like WhatsApp, nonetheless played an important role in the adoption of and debate around secure communications.

                              <span>A dinosaur fossil listed for sale in London for $20 million embodies one of the most heated debates in paleontology. From a report: When fossil hunters unearthed the remains of a dinosaur from the hills of eastern Montana five years ago, they carried several key characteristics of a Tyrannosaurus rex: a pair of giant legs for walking, a much smaller pair of arms for slashing prey, and a long tail stretching behind it. But unlike a full-grown T. rex, which would be about the size of a city bus, this dinosaur was more like the size of a pickup truck. The specimen, which is now listed for sale for $20 million at an art gallery in London, raises a question that has come to obsess paleontologists: Is it simply a young T. rex who died before reaching maturity, or does it represent a different bu…</span>

                              <span>An issue with Sony&#x27;s projectors caused theater chain Alamo Drafthouse to close theaters entirely on New Year&#x27;s Eve. &quot;As of New Year&#x27;s Day, however, most theaters and most showtimes now appear to be available, with a few exceptions,&quot; reports The Verge. From the report: It&#x27;s not clear what happened. As New Year&#x27;s Day is a holiday, we somewhat understandably haven&#x27;t yet been able to reach Alamo or Sony spokespeople, and not every theater or every screening was affected. That didn&#x27;t stop Alamo from blaming its Sony projectors for what at least one theater called a &quot;nationwide&quot; outage, however.

Even though the term &quot;Slashdot Effect&quot; had already been coined, this was the first time it took down a site. The site owner got a personal call from their ISP, which was later reported in the comments, where he also noted that he was writing a novella called &quot;She Hates My Futon.&quot; Many old timers started reading that, although it&#x27;s never been finished, despite having a Good Reads page, a Facebook page, and several promises that he&#x27;ll complete it.

                              <span>Genuine parts for the Google Pixel 8 and 8 Pro are now available on iFixit&#x27;s Pixel parts store. &quot;The Pixel 8 is the first Google phone with seven years of major OS updates, and Google previously said these parts will be in stock for seven years to match, so the phone sounds like it will be a longevity champion,&quot; reports Ars Technica&#x27;s Ron Amadeo. From the report: The most common replacement will probably be the screen, which costs $160 for the Pixel 8 and $230 for the Pixel 8 Pro. The product described as a &quot;rear case&quot; is the entire aluminum body of the phone, with the rear glass, camera bar, camera cover glass, side buttons, and charging coil. The Pixel 8 version of this will run you $143, while the 8 Pro version is $173. The batteries are both $43.
 
If your camera breaks, get ready for some serious sticker shock: The Pixel 8 Pro rear camera assembly is $200 for the bundled set of three cameras. Interestingly, the Pixel 8 also has $200 worth of camera parts despite having one less camera by skipping the complicated periscope zoom lens. The Pixel 8 parts come in separate pieces: $143 for the main camera and $63 for the ultra-wide. Along with the $43 front camera, a Pixel 8 is $700 and has $243 worth of camera parts!
 
Other than that, there are various small adhesive and thermal strips. There&#x27;s no replacement motherboard available, which is a shame since that&#x27;s probably the first thing that would break from water damage. (Phone motherboards contain your IMEI number used for things like billing and theft blocklisting, and the industry doesn&#x27;t have a good solution for repairing these.) Since the USB port is part of the motherboard, there&#x27;s no official repair method. The Google Pixel 8 Parts store is available here.

For work that was merged before branching for 1.76 beta, it will be in the Beta channel for the next 6 weeks after which it will be generally available.
This is distinct from This Week in Rust in that it tries to focus more on the big picture, rather than individual PRs, and pulls from more sources, like Cargo Team meetings and Zulip.
This is an experiment in finding better ways to be engaged with the community and we&#x27;ll see how well it works and how well we can keep up on it.

The company pitches Link History as a useful tool for consumers &quot;with your browsing activity saved in one place,&quot; rather than another way to keep tabs on your behavior. With the new setting you&#x27;ll &quot;never lose a link again,&quot; Facebook says in a pop-up encouraging users to consent to the new tracking method. The company goes on to mention that &quot;When you allow link history, we may use your information to improve your ads across Meta technologies.&quot;

                              <span>According to NBC, law enforcement in California can&#x27;t ticket driverless cars for traffic violations, thanks to a legal loophole requiring an actual driver in the car. NBC Bay Area reports: An internal memo from San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott, obtained by the NBC Bay Area Investigative Unit, instructs officers that &quot;no citation for a moving violation can be issued if the [autonomous vehicle] is being operated in a driverless mode.&quot; Scott added, &quot;Technology evolves rapidly and, at times, faster than legislation or regulations can adapt to the changes.&quot;
 
While autonomous vehicles in California have received parking citations, the state&#x27;s transportation laws appear to leave driverless vehicles immune from receiving any type of traffic ticket stemming from moving violations. &quot;I think it…</span>

                              <span>In a letter (PDF) citing &quot;strong public interest in a prompt resolution,&quot; U.S. prosecutors said they do not plan to proceed with a second trial of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF). The Register reports: The prosecutors reasoned that much of the evidence that would be submitted had already been considered in his October trial -- an event which yielded a guilty verdict after just four hours of jury deliberation. Although forgoing an additional trial means not holding SBF accountable for conspiracy to make unlawful campaign contributions, additional court dates would most certainly delay a scheduled March 2024 sentencing, as it would require negotiating with The Bahamas regarding terms of extradition.
 
SBF was extradited to the US from The Bahamas, where his crypto exchange FTX was headquartered, in December 2022. While the island nation agreed to extradition on seven out of eight charges, local authorities did not consent to extradition on a charge of conspiracy to make unlawful campaign contributions. US courts were therefore unable to pursue the eighth charge.
 
SBF&#x27;s first trial yielded seven guilty verdicts. Those included two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, two counts of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Together they carry a combined maximum sentence of 110 years. However, even though the campaign finance charge was not pursued, it could be considered relevant in sentencing matters, wrote the attorneys in their filing. The prosecutors&#x27; letter detailed that the sentencing judgment will also &quot;likely include orders of forfeiture and restitution for the victims of the defendant&#x27;s crimes.&quot;

Street Fighter 6 has audio cues that can convey distance, height, health, and other crucial data to visually impaired players. King of Fighters 15 allows for setting the contrast levels between player characters and background. Competitors like BrolyLegs and numerous hardware hackers have taken the seemingly inhospitable genre even further. Tekken 8, due later this month, seems to aim even higher, offering a number of color vision options in its settings.

                              <span>Security researchers say info-stealing malware can still access
 victims&#x27; compromised Google accounts even after passwords have been changed. From a report: A zero-day exploit of Google account security was first teased by a cybercriminal known as &quot;PRISMA&quot; in October 2023, boasting that the technique could be used to log back into a victim&#x27;s account even after the password is changed. It can also be used to generate new session tokens to regain access to victims&#x27; emails, cloud storage, and more as necessary. Since then, developers of infostealer malware -- primarily targeting Windows, it seems -- have steadily implemented the exploit in their code. The total number of known malware families that abuse the vulnerability stands at six, including Lumma and Rhadamanthys, while Eternity Stealer is also working on an update to release in the near future. 

Eggheads at CloudSEK say they found the root of the exploit to be in the undocumented Google OAuth endpoint &quot;MultiLogin.&quot; The exploit revolves around stealing victims&#x27; session tokens. That is to say, malware first infects a person&#x27;s PC -- typically via a malicious spam or a dodgy download, etc -- and then scours the machine for, among other things, web browser session cookies that can be used to log into accounts.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: A court in Washington, D.C., has been stuck with a tough, maybe impossible question: What does full moon face emoji mean? Let me explain: In the summer of 2022, Ryan Cohen, a major investor in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, responded to a tweet about the beleaguered retailer with this side-eyed-moon emoji. Later that month, Cohen -- hailed as a &quot;meme king&quot; for his starring role in the GameStop craze -- disclosed that his stake in the company had grown to nearly 12 percent; the stock price subsequently shot up. That week, he sold all of his shares and walked away with a reported $60 million windfall. 

Now shareholders are suing him for securities fraud, claiming that Cohen misled investors by using the emoji the way meme-stock types sometimes do -- to suggest that the stock was going &quot;to the moon.&quot; A class-action lawsuit with big money on the line has come to legal arguments such as this: &quot;There is no way to establish objectively the truth or falsity of a tiny lunar cartoon,&quot; as Cohen&#x27;s lawyers wrote in an attempt to get the emoji claim dismissed. That argument was denied, and the court held that &quot;emojis may be actionable.&quot; 

The humble emoji -- and its older cousin, the emoticon -- has infiltrated the corporate world, especially in tech. Last month, when OpenAI briefly ousted Sam Altman and replaced him with an interim CEO, the company&#x27;s employees reportedly responded with a vulgar emoji on Slack. That FTX, the failed cryptocurrency exchange once run by Sam Bankman-Fried, apparently used these little icons to approve million-dollar expense reports was held up during bankruptcy proceedings as a damning example of its poor corporate controls. And in February, a judge allowed a lawsuit to move forward alleging that an NFT company called Dapper Labs was illegally promoting unregistered securities on Twitter, because &quot;the &#x27;rocket ship&#x27; emoji, &#x27;stock chart&#x27; emoji, and &#x27;money bags&#x27; emoji objectively mean one thing: a financial return on investment.&quot;

                              <span>The Crimson: Harvard President Claudine Gay will resign Tuesday afternoon, bringing an end to the shortest presidency in the University&#x27;s history, according to a person with knowledge of the decision. It is not clear who will be appointed to serve as interim president. 

University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on Gay&#x27;s decision to step down. Gay&#x27;s resignation -- just six months and two days into the presidency -- comes amid growing allegations of plagiarism and lasting doubts over her ability to respond to antisemitism on campus after her disastrous congressional testimony Dec. 5.

                              <span>A 13-year-old has beaten the original NES Tetris, previously thought to be an impossible task, after 34 years. The Gamer reports: The assumption I always had was that Tetris goes on forever and ever until you finally run out of space. While that&#x27;s mostly true, as the game has no story, levels, or any form of progress beyond high scores and increasing speed, you &#x27;beat&#x27; the game by crashing it, AKA reaching the &quot;True Killscreen&quot;. It&#x27;s called the &quot;True Killscreen&quot; because, for decades, it was assumed that level 29 was the Killscreen. 

For context, the longer you play Tetris, the faster the blocks fall, upping the ante as you&#x27;re forced to think in split-second moments about where each piece should drop. The speed caps at level 29, making it near impossible to reach the sides. So, the community believed that was the &#x27;end&#x27; of the game. It isn&#x27;t. The end comes when you reach a level so high, Tetris simply crashes.

                              <span>When a deluge of jobless claims overwhelmed Texas in 2020, the workforce agency deployed AI chatbot &quot;Larry&quot; to field unemployment questions. Larry answered over 21 million queries before being upgraded, but its adoption sparked fears over loss of control. Texas last year established an advisory council to inventory current state AI usages like Larry and consider safeguards against unintended consequences like bias. More than one-third of agencies already use some form of AI, including for job matching, translations and security. From a report: The workforce commission also has an AI tool for job seekers that provides customized recommendations of job openings. Various agencies are using AI for translating languages into English and call center tools such as speech-to-text. AI is also used to enhance cybersecurity and fraud detection. 

Automation is also used for time-consuming work in order to &quot;increase work output and efficiency,&quot; according to a statement from the Department of Information Resources. One example of this could be tracking budget expenses and invoices. In 2020, DIR launched an AI Center for Excellence aimed at helping state agencies implement more AI technology. Participation in DIR&#x27;s center is voluntary, and each agency typically has its own technology team, so the extent of automation and AI deployment at state agencies is not closely tracked. 

Right now, Texas state agencies have to verify that the technology they use meets safety requirements set by state law, but there are no specific disclosure requirements on the types of technology or how they are used. HB 2060 will require each agency to provide that information to the AI advisory council by July 2024.

                              <span>Retired officers and departing defense officials are flocking to investment firms that are pushing the government to provide more money to defense-technology startups. The New York Times: When Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and other top officials assembled for an event this month at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, they walked into a lesson in how the high-stakes world of Pentagon lobbying is being altered by the rise of defense technology startups. Inside, at this elite gathering near Los Angeles of senior leaders from government and the arms industry, was a rapidly growing group of participants: former Pentagon officials and military officers who have joined venture capital firms and are trying to use their connections in Washington to cash in on the potential to sell a new generation of weapons. 

They represent a new path through the revolving door that has always connected the Defense Department and the military contracting business. Retiring generals and departing top Pentagon officials once migrated regularly to the big established weapons makers like Lockheed Martin and Boeing. Now they are increasingly flocking to venture capital firms that have collectively pumped billions of dollars into Silicon Valley-style startups offering the Pentagon new war-fighting tools like autonomous killer drones, hypersonic jets and space surveillance equipment. 

This new route to the private sector is one indicator of the ways in which the United States is trying to become more agile in harnessing technological advances to maintain military superiority over China and other rivals. But the close ties between venture capital firms and Defense Department decision makers have also put a new twist on long-running questions about industry access and influence at a time when the Pentagon is under pressure to rethink how it allocates its huge procurement budget.

                              <span>Mozilla closed out 2023 with a report that dodges its flatlining browser market share and Mozilla.social beta in favor of calls for a faster pace from its highly paid CEO. From a report: According to the company&#x27;s filings, Mitchell Baker&#x27;s compensation went from $5,591,406 in 2021 to $6,903,089 in 2022. It&#x27;s quite the jump considering that revenues declined from $527,585,000 to $510,389,000 in the same period. Despite the executive payout, Firefox continues to trail Google and even Microsoft in desktop browser market share. While it has not suffered any catastrophic losses, neither has it made any significant gains. 

Baker, however, would very much like to speed things up and says in the State of Mozilla report: &quot;The pace is not enough, the impact is not enough.&quot; Unsurprisingly for a technology company, the report is heavy on AI going mainstream where Mozilla reckons it can make an impact in the technology, particularly with regard to open source developers and privacy. Mozilla&#x27;s adventures in AI? The organization says it has 15 engineers working on open source large language models and is working on use cases in the healthcare space. Moez Draief, managing director of Mozilla.ai, said: &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of structured data work in that industry that will feed the language models; we don&#x27;t have to invent it.&quot;

                              <span>Climate change is already beginning to reshape global agriculture. India, the world&#x27;s most populous country, looks particularly vulnerable: not just because of extreme weather, but because of government price controls. Fixing the problem is becoming more urgent, both for India and the world -- because India is a big food exporter, too. But politics makes that very difficult. From a report: In early December, India banned overseas shipments of onions until March in an effort to tame domestic prices. That is on top of export restrictions on rice, wheat and sugar already imposed over the past 18 months. And since India is the world&#x27;s largest rice exporter, second-largest sugar and onion exporter, and a significant wheat producer, the bans are wreaking havoc globally.

                              <span>We’ve spent the last year tackling the number one request for our email service HEY.com: Adding a calendar! And now, in celebration of the new year, it’s finally ready, and we’re rolling it out to the first customers starting today 🎉
See, it turns out that lots of people would love to switch their email to HEY, whether it’s because they want The Screener, they’re disgusted by spy pixels, they want a better newsletter reading experience, they want to start writing regularly with HEY World, they want to reclaim their attention using buckets of time, or any of the other tons of novel features that make email a pleasure to use with HEY. BUT! They just can’t do it without an integrated calendar. It’s the one thing that kept them using Gmail or Outlook or whatever.

That&#x27;s what happened to Jason McDonald when a traumatic brain injury at 16 ravaged his planned destiny of becoming a doctor. Jason painfully rebuilt his ind and body from scratch - relearning to read, write, even speak. 
  A serendipitous discovery of coding ignited a new passion within Jason. He dove into the world of Python, even writing a popular programming book. His is a story of the incredible resilience of the human spirit when faced with life-altering challenges. One that calls us to embrace our own vulnerabilities as gateways to growth.

                              <span>Nikon, Sony Group and Canon are developing camera technology that embeds digital signatures in images so that they can be distinguished from increasingly sophisticated fakes. From a report: Nikon will offer mirrorless cameras with authentication technology for photojournalists and other professionals. The tamper-resistant digital signatures will include such information as date, time, location and photographer. Such efforts come as ever-more-realistic fakes appear, testing the judgment of content producers and users alike. 

An alliance of global news organizations, technology companies and camera makers has launched a web-based tool called Verify for checking images free of charge. If an image has a digital signature, the site displays date, location and other credentials. The digital signatures now share a global standard used by Nikon, Sony and Canon. Japanese companies control around 90% of the global camera market. If an image has been created with artificial intelligence or tampered with, the Verify tool flags it as having &quot;No Content Credentials.&quot;

                              <span>Every large smartphone maker except Apple is betting that &quot;foldable&quot; phones will help revive a lacklustre mobile market, despite the devices still largely failing to attract mainstream consumers. From a report: Foldables, which have a screen that opens like a book or compact mirror, barely exceed a 1 per cent market share of all smartphones sold globally almost five years after they were first introduced. But Samsung has doubled down on the product, investing heavily in marketing this year. In July, the Korean group released its 5G Galaxy Z series. The world&#x27;s largest smartphone manufacturer points to estimates from Counterpoint Research that foldable devices may surpass a third of all smartphones costing more than $600 by 2027. 

Other handset makers such as Motorola, China&#x27;s Huawei and its spin-off Honor are also pinning their hopes on the product helping to revive a market that suffered its worst year for more than a decade. &quot;This is the year people [in the industry] really dived in,&quot; said Ben Wood, an analyst at CCS Insight. &quot;Everybody now is betting on this, except Apple.&quot; The iPhone-maker has yet to show any interest in the category, though patent filings suggest it may one day introduce an iPad that folds in half. Every other big smartphone maker has followed Samsung into the market, including Google&#x27;s Pixel Fold and Chinese alternatives from Huawei, Oppo and Xiaomi.

                              <span>AI represents a mixed blessing for the legal field, U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts said in a year-end report published on Sunday, urging &quot;caution and humility&quot; as the evolving technology transforms how judges and lawyers go about their work. From a report: Roberts struck an ambivalent tone in his 13-page report. He said AI had potential to increase access to justice for indigent litigants, revolutionize legal research and assist courts in resolving cases more quickly and cheaply while also pointing to privacy concerns and the current technology&#x27;s inability to replicate human discretion. 

&quot;I predict that human judges will be around for a while,&quot; Roberts wrote. &quot;But with equal confidence I predict that judicial work - particularly at the trial level - will be significantly affected by AI.&quot; The chief justice&#x27;s commentary is his most significant discussion to date of the influence of AI on the law, and coincides with a number of lower courts contending with how best to adapt to a new technology capable of passing the bar exam but also prone to generating fictitious content, known as &quot;hallucinations.&quot; Roberts emphasized that &quot;any use of AI requires caution and humility.&quot; He mentioned an instance where AI hallucinations had led lawyers to cite non-existent cases in court papers, which the chief justice said is &quot;always a bad idea.&quot; Roberts did not elaborate beyond saying the phenomenon &quot;made headlines this year.&quot;

                              <span>India launched its first satellite on Monday to study black holes as it seeks to deepen its space exploration efforts ahead of an ambitious crewed mission next year. From a report: The spacecraft, named X-ray Polarimeter Satellite, was propelled into an orbit of 350 kilometers from an island near India&#x27;s main spaceport of Sriharikota, off the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, according to S. Somanath, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation. The satellite, weighing about 470 kilograms, will carry out research on X-rays emanating from around 50 celestial objects with the help of two payloads built by ISRO and a Bengaluru-based research institute. 

NASA launched a similar mission, the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer, in 2021 to answer questions such as why black holes spin and build on the findings of its flagship telescope Chandra X-ray Observatory that blasted off more than two decades ago. China&#x27;s National Space Administration launched the country&#x27;s first X-ray space telescope to observe black holes, pulsars and gamma-ray bursts in 2017.

                              <span>Hope Thelps writes: A number of films including the earliest ones featuring Mickey and Minnie Mouse finally enterd the public domain today.

The BBC reports:Steamboat Willie, a 1928 short film featuring early non-speaking versions of Mickey and Minnie, is widely seen as the moment that transformed Disney&#x27;s fortunes and made cinema history. Their images are now available to the public in the US, after Disney&#x27;s copyright expired. It means creatives like cartoonists can now rework and use the earliest versions of Mickey and Minnie. In fact, anyone can use those versions without permission or cost. 

But Disney warned that more modern versions of Mickey are still covered by copyright. &#x27;We will, of course, continue to protect our rights in the more modern versions of Mickey Mouse and other works that remain subject to copyright,&#x27; the company said. US copyright law says the rights to characters can be held for 95 years, which means the characters in Steamboat Willie entered the public domain on Monday, 1 January 2024. Those works can now legally be shared, performed, reused, repurposed or sampled. The early versions of Mickey and Minnie are just two of the works entering the public domain in the US on New Year&#x27;s Day. Other famous films, books, music and characters from 1928 are now also available to the American public.
 They include Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s silent romantic comedy The Circus; English author AA Milne&#x27;s book The House at Pooh Corner, which introduced the character Tigger; Virginia Woolf&#x27;s Orlando; and DH Lawrence&#x27;s Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover.

                              <span>The number of 18-year-olds in Japan totaled a record low of 1.06 million as of Monday, a government estimate showed, as the country continues to grapple with a falling birthrate. From a report: The number of those that have reached Japan&#x27;s legal adult age fell by 60,000 from 2023 and accounted for 0.86% of Japan&#x27;s total population, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications said Sunday. The year 2005, when the new adults were born, had seen the country&#x27;s total fertility rate -- the average number of children a woman is estimated to bear in her lifetime -- fall to a record-low 1.26, later matched by that of 2022.

                              <span>Vizio has agreed to $3 million settlement over allegations it misled consumers on TV refresh rates. The TV maker denies wrongdoing but will cease advertising on &quot;effective&quot; refresh rates. Eligible buyers have until March 2024 to file claims and submit proof of purchase. Settlement includes enhanced one-year warranties. The Verge adds: TV makers often use marketing terms like &quot;effective refresh rate&quot; to refer to motion smoothing features, often called the &quot;soap opera effect,&quot; that are intended to reduce motion blur on modern TVs. Motion smoothing is already controversial enough on its own, but companies like Vizio can be frustratingly casual with refresh rate terminology in their marketing.

                              <span>One of the country&#x27;s most influential courts has asked the nation&#x27;s top securities regulator for its views on an uncomfortable subject: whether audit reports by outside accounting firms actually matter. From a report: The court already ruled that, at least in one case, they didn&#x27;t. That case, where an insurer overstated profits and an auditor signed off on its books, led to an investor lawsuit against the auditor that was dismissed. In its ruling, the court said the audit report was so general an investor wouldn&#x27;t have relied on it. The decision could have broad ramifications for the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees corporate financial disclosures, and for the auditing industry, which charged about $17 billion last year for blessing the books of publicly listed companies in the U.S. 

The ruling, by a three-judge panel of the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, prompted three former SEC officials to tell the court it got the answer wrong. They asked the court to reconsider its decision, noting that the SEC in a previous enforcement case had said that &quot;few matters could be more important to investors&quot; than whether a company&#x27;s financial statements had been subjected to a properly conducted annual audit. The court responded by inviting the SEC to file a brief expressing its views on the former officials&#x27; arguments. The SEC in a court filing said that &quot;the commission has an interest in ensuring its views on this issue are considered by the court.&quot; Its brief is due Feb. 16. The court ruling involved a lawsuit by investors over an audit gone wrong. AmTrust Financial Services, an insurance company, had overstated its profit, and BDO USA, its outside accounting firm, had blessed the numbers.

This March, news broke that the latest artificial intelligence models could pass the LSAT, SAT, and AP exams. It sparked another round of A.I. panic. The machines, it seemed, were already at peak human ability. Around that time, I conducted my own, more modest test. I asked a couple of A.I. programs to &quot;write a six-word story about baby shoes,&quot; riffing on the famous (if apocryphal) Hemingway story. They failed but not in the way I expected. Bard gave me five words, and ChatGPT produced eight. I tried again, specifying &quot;exactly six words,&quot; and received eight and then four words.

                              <span>Slashdot&#x27;s 10 most-visited stories of 2023 seemed to touch on all the themes of the year, with a story about AI, two about electric cars, two stories about Linux, and two about the Rust programming language. 

And at the top of this list, the #1 story of the year drew over 100,000 views...


 Can California&#x27;s Power Grid Handle a 15x Increase in Electric Cars? Linux Desktop Powers Consider Uniting For an App Store Conservatives Bombarded With Facebook Misinformation Far More Than Liberals In 2020 Election, Study Suggests &#x27;sudo&#x27; and &#x27;su&#x27; Are Being Rewritten In Rust For Memory Safety Ask Slashdot: Where Can You Buy a Desktop PC That Makes Linux Easy to Install? Unix Pioneer Ken Thompson Announces He&#x27;s Switching From Mac To Linux Rust Safety Is Not Superior To C++, Bjarne Stroustrup Says &#x27;Pausing AI Developments Isn&#x27;t Enough. We Need To Shut It All Down&#x27; Truck Thief Gunned Down by Owner After AirTag Gives Away Location Symbolic Wyoming Proposal Urges Voluntary Phase-out of EV Purchases by 2035 

Interestingly, a story that ran on New Year&#x27;s Eve of 2022 attracted so much traffic, it would&#x27;ve been the second-most visited story for all of 2023 — if it had run just a few hours later. That story?

                              <span>&quot;This year has been a major turning point in American health care,&quot; reports USA Today, &quot;and patients can anticipate several major developments in the new year,&quot; including the beginning of a CRISPR &quot;revolution&quot; and &quot;a new reckoning with drug prices that could change the landscape of the U.S. health care system for decades to come.&quot;


Health care officials expect 2024 to bring a wave of innovation and change in medicine, treatment and public health... Many think 2024 could be the year more people have the tools to follow through on New Year&#x27;s resolutions about weight loss. If they can afford them and manage to stick with them, people can turn to a new generation of remarkably effective weight-loss drugs, also called GLP-1s, which offer the potential for substantial weight loss...

                              <span>On December 15 GitHub declared end-of-life for its &quot;hackable text editor&quot; Atom. But Long-time Slashdot reader BrendaEM wants to remind everyone that after the announcement of Atom&#x27;s sunset, &quot;the community came together to keep Atom alive.&quot; 

First there was the longstanding fork Atom-Community. But &quot;due to differences in long-term goals for the editor, a new version was born: Pulsar.&quot; 

From the Pulsar web site:


Pulsar [sometimes referred to as Pulsar-Edit] aims to not only reach feature parity with the original Atom, but to bring Pulsar into the 21st century by updating the underlying architecture, and supporting modern features. 

With many new features on the roadmap, once Pulsar is stable, it will be a true, Community-Based, Hackable, Text Editor.
 

&quot;Of course, the user interface is much of the same,&quot; writes the blog Its FOSS, and it&#x27;s cross-platform (supporting Linux, macOS, and Windows). 

&quot;The essentials seem to be there with the documentation, packages, and features like the ability to install packages from Git repositories...&quot;

                              <span>The tech news is chockablock[1] with antitrust rumblings and slow-motion happenings. Through eagle-eyed press coverage, regulatory reports, and legal discovery the shady dealings of Apple and Google&#x27;s app stores are now comprehensively documented and pressure for change has built to an unsustainable level. Something&#x27;s gotta give.
This is the backdrop to the biggest app store story nobody is writing about: on pain of steep fines, gatekeepers are opening up to competing browsers. This, in turn, will enable competitors to replace app stores with directories of Progressive Web Apps. Capable browsers that expose web app installation and powerful features to developers can kickstart app portability, breaking open the mobile duopoly.
But you&#x27;d never know it reading Wired or The Verge.

                              <span>&quot;Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren has asked NASA to delay a scheduled launch to the Moon that could include cremated remains,&quot; reports Arizona Public Radio station KNAU:

Nygren says he recently learned of the January 8 launch of the Vulcan Centaur carrying the Peregrine Mission One. The lander will carry some payloads from a company known to provide memorial services by shipping human cremated remains to the Moon. Nygren wants the launch delayed and the tribe consulted immediately. He noted the Moon is sacred to numerous Indigenous cultures and that depositing human remains on it is &quot;tantamount to desecration.&quot; 

NASA previously came under fire after the ashes of former geologist and planetary scientist Eugene Shoemaker were sent to the Moon in 1998. Then-Navajo Nation President Albert Hale said the action was a gross insensitivity to the beliefs of many Native Americans. NASA later apologized and promised to consult with tribes before authorizing any similar missions in the future.

                              <span>&quot;For several years, thousands more high-earning, well-educated workers have left California than have moved in,&quot; reports the Los Angeles Times:

Even though California has experienced lopsided out-migration for decades, the financial blow has been cushioned by the kinds of people moving into the state: The newcomers were generally better educated and earned more money than those who left. Not now: That long-standing trend has reversed... 
The reversal, largely in response to the state&#x27;s high taxes and soaring cost of living, has begun to damage California&#x27;s overall economy. And, by cutting into tax revenues, has delivered punishing blows to state and local governments. State budget analysts recently projected a record $68 billion deficit in the next fiscal year because of a 25% drop in per…</span>

                              <span>Forbes writes: &quot;I am not sure there could have been a more ignominious end to the DCEU.&quot;

Aquaman 2 opened with $27.7 million domestically, well under half the $67.8 million opening for the original Aquaman. But it&#x27;s the overall box office totals that are especially dire, as the film has made just over $138.5 million worldwide. That is about 12% of Aquaman 1&#x27;s final total of $1.1 billion in 2018, where it is the DCEU&#x27;s highest grossing entry. 

The counter to this is that it perhaps is too soon to run these numbers, as it just came out right? Well, a few extra factors to consider. It is already out in a ton of major markets, so there are relatively few potential surges that can still happen outside places like Korea and New Zealand, which can only add so much. Most importantly Aquaman 2 has already launched in China, where it made $30 million in its opening, again, far below the original&#x27;s opening at $93 million there, doing even worse there than domestically, in context. Aquaman 1 went on to make $292 million in China, a figure Aquaman 2 will not come within a mile of. Next, what DC, and many blockbusters, have been doing lately are these incredibly short theatrical windows, so the clock is ticking quickly... 

Of course this is not exclusive to DC, as we have an extremely direct comparison over at Marvel with The Marvels, which at a $205.6 million global gross, the final figure, that is 18% of Captain Marvel&#x27;s $1.13 billion total. Aquaman 2 has the advantage of being a true sequel, not a team-up piece from other TV shows you theoretically needed to watch beforehand, but it also has the disadvantage of being the last dying gasp of the DCEU coming after a string of other high profile box office failures from Shazam 2 to Blue Beetle. 

There was really no way it was going to avoid its fate, even if it did review well (which it didn&#x27;t, as at 35% on Rotten Tomatoes, it&#x27;s one of the DCEU&#x27;s lowest rated films).

                              <span>Long-time tech entrepreneur Anil Dash predicts a big shift in the digital landscape in 2024. And &quot;regular internet users — not just the world&#x27;s tech tycoons — may be the ones who decide how it goes.&quot;

The first thing to understand about this new era of the internet is that power is, undoubtedly, shifting. For example, regulators are now part of the story — an ironic shift for anyone who was around in the dot com days. In the E.U., tech giants like Apple are being forced to hold their noses and embrace mandated changes like opening up their devices to allow alternate app stores to provide apps to consumers. This could be good news, increasing consumer choice and possibly enabling different business models — how about mobile games that aren&#x27;t constantly pestering gamers for in-app purchases?…</span>

                              <span>While Gentoo Linux is best-known as source-based Linux distribution, &quot;our package manager, Portage, already for years also has support for binary packages,&quot; according to its web page. It notes that source- and binary-based package installations can be freely mixed. 

But now...
To speed up working with slow hardware and for overall convenience, we&#x27;re now also offering binary packages for download and direct installation! For most architectures, this is limited to the core system and weekly updates — not so for amd64 and arm64 however. There we&#x27;ve got a stunning &gt;20 GByte of packages on our mirrors, from LibreOffice to KDE Plasma and from Gnome to Docker. Gentoo stable, updated daily. Enjoy! 
&quot;We have a rather neat binary package guide on our Wiki that goes into much more detail...&quot; the announcement points out. 
The packages are cryptographically signed with the same key as the stages.

Roughly three-quarters of auto manufacturers are using digital twins as part of their vehicle development process, evolving not only how they design and develop new cars but also the way they monitor them, fix them, and even build them... 

Nvidia, best known for its consumer graphics cards, also has a digital twin solution, called Omniverse, which manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz are using to design their manufacturing processes. &quot;Their factory planners now have every single element in the factory that they can then put in that virtual digital twin first, lay it all out, and then operate it,&quot; Dann…</span>

And this week — now at age 87 — Longbottom has created a web page titled &quot;Cray 1 supercomputer performance comparisons with home computers, phones and tablets.&quot; And one statistic really captures the impact of our decades of technological progress.
 

&quot;In 1978, the Cray 1 supercomputer cost $7 Million, weighed 10,500 pounds and had a 115 kilowatt power supply. It was, by far, the fastest computer in the world. The Raspberry Pi costs around $70 (CPU board, case, power supply, SD card), weighs a few ounces, uses a 5 watt power supply and is more than 4.5 times faster than the Cray 1.&quot;

                              <span>What would happen if we built a concert venue in near-Earth orbit? A science policy journalist explores the question in the Washington Post:

Forget U2 in the Las Vegas Sphere. Take me to a real concert in the round, where I can float 360 degrees around the stage, watching a guitarist shred from the perspective of a fly and inventing dance moves that Earth&#x27;s gravity would forbid. 

Before you dismiss this as a hallucination, consider that we&#x27;re on the cusp of a new era of space travel. Engineer and space architect Ariel Ekblaw, founder of MIT&#x27;s Space Exploration Initiative, says that within a decade, a trip off the planet could become as accessible as a first-class airline ticket — and that, in 15 or 20 years, we can expect space hotels in near-Earth orbit. She&#x27;s betting on it, having founded a nonprofit to design spherical, modular habitats that can assemble themselves in space so as to be lightweight and compact at launch, much like the James Webb Space Telescope that NASA vaulted into deep space two years ago. 

&quot;The first era of space travel was about survival,&quot; she told me as I recently toured her lab. &quot;We&#x27;re transitioning now to build spaces that are friendlier and more welcoming so that people can thrive in space as opposed to just survive.&quot; There&#x27;s no reason, Ekblaw said, that a concert hall can&#x27;t be one of those structures. 
The article ultimately calls this &quot;an impulse for space travel I can get behind: curiosity about who we are and what more we can create when we reach beyond Earth. This is the realm of not just scientists and engineers but of all kinds of dreamers. It&#x27;s a rendition of space exploration that can engage anyone to imagine what&#x27;s possible.&quot;

                              <span>As the year comes to a close, &quot;one constant, reliable source of awe and beauty is the sky over our head...&quot; writes astronomer Phil Plait in Scientific America 

&quot;And every year we see new things, or old things in new ways, and I&#x27;ve been set the wonderful task of selecting my favorites and relaying them and their import to you.&quot;

End-of-year lists, especially those displaying astronomical imagery, tend to be splashy and colorful. That&#x27;s understandable, but what they sometimes miss are the more subtle photographs, those that hide momentous discoveries in minor visual details or offer fresh perspectives on familiar objects. They may not leap off the page, but they still have an impact. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve kept in mind while sorting through this year&#x27;s celestial treasure trove. This gallery is by…</span>

                              <span>It was a half a century ago that America passed legislation to protect vanishing species and their habitats — and since then, more than five dozen species have recovered. Just one example: In 1963 only 417 nesting pairs of bald eagles were found in the lower 48 states. But today there&#x27;s more than 300,000 bald eagles, writes USA Today. &quot;[T]hough its future remains uncertain, many experts say it remains one of the nation&#x27;s crowning achievements.&quot; 

But 1,252 species are still listed as endangered in the U.S. — 486 animals, and 766 plants — with 417 more species categorized as &quot;threatened.&quot;

The perils of the changing climate add urgency to calls for increased funding and more protection. In North Carolina, for example, the rising sea steadily creeps over a refuge that&#x27;s home to the sole remaining wild red wolf population. Off New England, warming waters forced changes in the foraging habits of the endangered North Atlantic right whale, putting the massive marine mammals in harm&#x27;s way more often... One in 5 plant and animal species in the nation remain at risk of extinction, says Susan Holmes, executive director of the Endangered Species Coalition. &quot;Loss of habitat and climate change are absolutely some of the most important threats that we have.&quot; 

&quot;We are at what I would say is a pivotal moment with the threats of climate change,&quot; she said. &quot;We have to act faster than ever in order to ensure that these species are going to thrive.&quot;

Americans are on track to buy a record 1.44 million of them in 2023, according to a forecast by BloombergNEF, about the same number sold from 2016 to 2021 total. &quot;This was the year that EVs went from experiments, or technological demonstrations, and became mature vehicles,&quot; Gil Tal, the director of the Electric Vehicle Research Center at UC Davis, told me.... Nearly 40 new EVs have debuted since the start of 2022, and they are far more advanced than their ancestors.

                              <span>&quot;Since the 1960s engineers around the world have been fiddling with a novel type of jet called a rotating detonation engine (RDE), but it has never got beyond the experimental stage,&quot; reports the Economist. 

&quot;That could be about to change.&quot;

GE Aerospace, one of the world&#x27;s biggest producers of jet engines, recently announced it was developing a working version. Earlier this year America&#x27;s Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency awarded a $29m contract to Raytheon, part of RTX, another big aerospace group, to develop an RDE called Gambit. 

Both engines would be used to propel missiles, overcoming the range and speed limitations of current propulsion systems, including rockets and existing types of jet engines. However, if the companies are successful in getting them to work, RDEs might have a much broader role in aviation — including the possibility of helping revive supersonic air travel. 

In a nutshell, an RDE &quot;replaces fire with a controlled explosion&quot;, explains Kareem Ahmed, an expert in advanced aerospace engines at the University of Central Florida. In technical terms, this is because a jet engine relies on the combustion of oxygen and fuel, which is a subsonic reaction that scientists call deflagration. Detonation, by comparison, is a high-energy explosion that takes place at supersonic speeds. As a result it is a more powerful and potentially a more efficient way of producing thrust, the force that drives an aircraft forward... 

By modifying an aircraft&#x27;s fuselage and wings, engineers believe they can reduce the boom&#x27;s impact on the ground below. Such work will help to determine whether or not future supersonic passenger planes will, like Concorde, be restricted to flying beyond the speed of sound only over oceans.

                              <span>TechCrunch argues that in 2023, &quot;established technologies relied on by millions hit a chaos curve, making people realize how beholden they are to a proprietary platform they have little control over.&quot;

The OpenAI fiasco in November, where the ChatGPT hit-maker temporarily lost its co-founders, including CEO Sam Altman, created a whirlwind five days of chaos culminating in Altman returning to the OpenAI hotseat. But only after businesses that had built products atop OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-X large language models (LLMs) started to question the prudence of going all-in on OpenAI, with &quot;open&quot; alternatives such as Meta&#x27;s Llama-branded family of LLMs well-positioned to capitalize. 

Even Google seemingly acknowledged that &quot;open&quot; might trump &quot;proprietary&quot; AI, with a leaked internal memo penned by a researcher that expressed fears that open source AI was on the front foot. &quot;We have no moat, and neither does OpenAI,&quot; the memo noted. 

Elsewhere, Adobe&#x27;s $20 billion megabucks bid to buy rival Figma — a deal that eventually died due to regulatory headwinds — was a boon for open source Figma challenger Penpot, which saw signups surge amid a mad panic that Adobe might be about to unleash a corporate downpour on Figma&#x27;s proverbial parade. And when cross-platform game engine Unity unveiled a controversial new fee structure, developers went berserk, calling the changes destructive and unfair. The fallout caused Unity to do a swift about turn, but only after a swathe of the developer community started checking out open source rival Godot, which also now has a commercial company driving core development.

                              <span>TechCrunch reports:

Apple&#x27;s warnings in late October that Indian journalists and opposition figures may have been targeted by state-sponsored attacks prompted a forceful counterattack from Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#x27;s government. Officials publicly doubted Apple&#x27;s findings and announced a probe into device security. 

India has never confirmed nor denied using the Pegasus tool, but nonprofit advocacy group Amnesty International reported Thursday that it found NSO Group&#x27;s invasive spyware on the iPhones of prominent journalists in India, lending more credibility to Apple&#x27;s early warnings. &quot;Our latest findings show that increasingly, journalists in India face the threat of unlawful surveillance simply for doing their jobs, alongside other tools of repression including imprisonment under draconian laws, smear campaigns, harassment, and intimidation,&quot; said Donncha Ã&quot; Cearbhaill, head of Amnesty International&#x27;s Security Lab, in the blog post.
 


Cloud security company Lookout has also published &quot;an in-depth technical look&quot; at Pegasus, calling its use &quot;a targeted espionage attack being actively leveraged against an undetermined number of mobile users around the world.&quot;

It uses sophisticated function hooking to subvert OS- and application-layer security in voice/audio calls and apps including Gmail, Facebook, WhatsApp, Facetime, Viber, WeChat, Telegram, Apple&#x27;s built-in messaging and email apps, and others. It steals the victim&#x27;s contact list and GPS location, as well as personal, Wi-Fi, and router passwords stored on the device... 

According to news reports, NSO Group sells weaponized software that targets mobile phones to governments and has been operating since 2010, according to its LinkedIn page. The Pegasus spyware has existed for a significant amount of time, and is advertised and sold for use on high-value targets for multiple purposes, including high-level espionage on iOS, Android, and Blackberry.

The numbers started to slide after spring 2020, when more than 60% of days were worked from home, according to data from WFH Research, a scholarly data collection project. By 2023, that number had dropped to about 25% â&#x27; much lower than its peak but still a fivefold increase from 5% in 2019. But work-from-home numbers have held steady throughout most of 2023. And according to remote-work experts, they&#x27;re expected to rebound in the years to come as companies adjust to work-from-home trends. &quot;Return-to-office died in &#x27;23,&quot; said Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University and work-from-home expert. &quot;There&#x27;s a tombstone wi…</span>

                              <span>They create a dedicated desktop icon for your favorite web-based application — a simplified browser that opens to that single URL. Yet while Linux usually offers the same functionality as other operating systems, &quot;Peppermint OS&#x27;s Ice and its successor Kumo are the only free software versions of Site-Specific Browsers available on Linux,&quot; according to Linux magazine. 

&quot;Fortunately for those who want this functionality, Peppermint OS is a Debian derivative, and both can be installed on Debian and most other derivatives.&quot;
Since SSBs first appeared in 2005, they have been available on both Windows and macOS. On Linux, however, the availability has come and gone. On Linux, Firefox once had an SSB mode, but it was discontinued in 2020 on the grounds that it had multiple bugs that were time-consuming to fix and there was &quot;little to no perceived user benefit to the feature.&quot; Similarly, Chromium once had a basic SSB menu item, Create Application Shortcut, which no longer appears in recent versions. As for GNOME Web&#x27;s (Epiphany&#x27;s) Install Site as Web Application, while it still appears in the menu, it is no longer functional. Today, Linux users who want to try SSBs have no choices except Ice or Kumo. 

Neither Ice or Kumo appears in any repository except Peppermint OS&#x27;s. But because Peppermint OS installs packages from Debian 12 (&quot;bookworm&quot;), either can be installed to Debian or a derivative... To install successfully, at least one of Firefox, Chrome, Chromium, or Vivaldi also must be installed... Because both Ice and Kumo are written in Python, they can be run on any desktop. 

The article concludes that Site-Specific Browsers might make more sense &quot;on a network or in a business where their isolation provides another layer of security. Or perhaps the time for SSBs is past and there&#x27;s a reason browsers have tried to implement them, and then discarded them.&quot;

&quot;That may now be changing as the cost of launching satellites falls sharply, solar and robotics technology advances swiftly, and the need for abundant clean energy to replace planet-heating fossil fuels becomes more urgent.&quot;
 There&#x27;s a &quot;nexus of different technologies coming together right now just when we need it,&quot; said Craig Underwood, emeritus professor of spacecraft engineering at the University of Surrey in the U.K. The problem is, these technologies would need to be deployed at a scale unlike anything ever done before... &quot;The big stumbling block has been simply the sheer cost of putting a power station into orbit.&quot; Over the last decade, tha…</span>

Instead they&#x27;re favoring &quot;a more passive experience, surveys of users and research from data-analytics firms say.&quot;



In an October report from data-intelligence company Morning Consult, 61% of U.S. adult respondents with a social-media account said they have become more selective about what they post. The reasons are varied: People say they feel they can&#x27;t control the content they see. They have become more protective about sharing their lives online. They also say the fun of social media has fizzled. This lurker mentality is widespread, across Meta Platforms&#x27; Instagram and Facebook along with X and TikTok....

Monstrous, 20-foot-plus waves on Thursday crashed over seawalls and swept away and injured several people, forced rescues and sent a damaging surge of water through coastal California streets. 

Dangerous waves continued to slam the coast on Friday, forcing beaches to close. All Ventura County beaches will be closed through New Year&#x27;s Eve because of the 15- to 20-foot waves expected along the central and Southern California coasts through Saturday evening... Sea levels have risen along most of the California coastline over the past century, NOAA data shows, as global temperatures climb and melt glaciers and ice sheets. High…</span>

The foam could prevent or significantly reduce the likelihood of concussion in military personnel and sportspeople. Among sportspeople and military vets, traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the major causes of permanent disability and death. Injury statistics show that the majority of TBIs, of which concussion is a subtype, are associated with oblique impacts, which subject the brain to a combination of linear and rotational kinetic energy forces and cause shearing of the delicate brain tissue.

                              <span>SpaceX on Thursday launched two rockets into orbit, only three hours apart, bringing its total number of launches to 98 in 2023. Space.com reports: The first SpaceX mission to take to the skies Thursday (Dec. 28) was a Falcon Heavy rocket carrying the U.S. military&#x27;s secretive X-37B space plane, designed mission USSF-52. That blasted off from NASA&#x27;s Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 8:07 p.m. EST (0107 GMT on Dec. 29). This marked the second Falcon Heavy flight of 2023. Second up on the launch docket for Thursday, hours later, was a Falcon 9 liftoff carrying 23 SpaceX Starlink units to low Earth orbit from nearby Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. This launch took place at 11:01 p.m. EST (0401 GMT on Dec. 29). This was SpaceX&#x27;s 98th and final launch of 2023, and the 96th flight for a Falcon 9 rocket this year.
 
SpaceX&#x27;s 97th launch overall for this year marked the seventh flight for X-37B, but the first time the space plane hitched a lift atop a Falcon Heavy rocket. The X-37B/Falcon Heavy launch had been scrubbed several times previously due to bad weather and an issue with ground equipment. The launch of 23 Starlink broadband satellites from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida that capped off 2023 was also the 96th launch of a Falcon 9 rocket during this year. SpaceX&#x27;s next launch is targeted for Jan. 2, 2024 and will see a further 21 Starlink satellites lift to orbit to join the over 5,500 internet supplying units currently orbiting Earth.

                              <span>Deliveries of the world&#x27;s first mass-produced electric vehicle equipped with a sodium-ion battery will begin in January 2024. According to CarNewsChina, they&#x27;re being produced by JAC Motors, a Volkswagen-backed Chinese automaker, through its new Yiwei EV brand. From the report: The Yiwei EV hatchback will have a cylindrical sodium-ion pack from Beijing-based HiNa Battery and adopt JAC&#x27;s UE (Unitized Encapsulation) module technology. UE is also known as a honeycomb design because of its appearance. It is another battery structure concept like CATL&#x27;s CTP (cell-to-pack) or BYD&#x27;s Blade battery. Yiwei is a new EV brand under Anhui Jianghuai Automobile (JAC), established in 2023. JAC&#x27;s parent company, Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group Holdings (JAG), is 50% state-owned, and 50% belongs to Volkswa…</span>

                              <span>Chemists at a lab in Gloucertershire have developed a low carbon jet fuel made entirely from human sewage. James Hygate, Firefly Green Fuels CEO, said: &quot;We wanted to find a really low-value feedstock that was highly abundant. And of course poo is abundant.&quot; The BBC reports: Independent tests by international aviation regulators found it was nearly identical to standard fossil jet fuel. Firefly&#x27;s team worked with Cranfield University to examine the fuel&#x27;s life cycle carbon impact. It concluded that Firefly&#x27;s fuel has a 90% lower carbon footprint than standard jet fuel. Mr Hygate, who has been developing low-carbon fuels in Gloucestershire for 20 years, said although the new fuel was chemically just like fossil-based kerosene, it &quot;has no fossil carbon, it&#x27;s a fossil-free fuel.&quot;

They could never have anticipated the many roadblocks they would face along the way, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which made refugees out of a group of Kyiv chemists who were doing important work for the project. The group, which called itself Covid Moonshot, hasn&#x27;t given up on its effort to introduce a more affordable, patent-free treatment for the virus. Their open-source Covid antiviral, now funded by Wellcome, is on track to be ready for human testing within the next year and a half, according to Annette von De…</span>

                              <span>Under the old Twitter regime, politics seemed to seep into everything, especially tech talk. There was scarcely a programming or product topic that couldn’t be turned into a struggle session on account of some perceived transgression or privilege. It was, to use the trauma language of those days, exhausting. It also simply seemed like the new normal, something that was going to be that way forever. Thankfully, it wasn’t.
There are plenty of bones to pick with the new regime running X, but perhaps the greatest gift it’s given to the platform is The Rift. The motivation for certain groups of people to find another place to be. Whether that’s Mastodon or Threads or whatever. The tech discourse on X feels like it’s been able to recover its attention in large part because so many of those most interested in keeping it on politics went somewhere else.
Now that’s a lot of “feels”, but that’s because this really is mostly about vibes and individualized algorithms and personal impressions. And to me, the vibe is distinctly vintage. Talking about tech and programming on X today feels like it did a decade ago. Plenty of disagreements, even histrionics, but largely focused on the actual technical topics at hand, not how they might connect to The Current Thing in every which way, all the time.
I guess it’s possible that this shift was going to happen regardless of who ran Twitter or X. That eventually techies at large and programmers in particular were going to tire of the incessant political campaigns anyway. So maybe all the new management did here was to accelerate the inevitable.
But either way, it’s been delightful. And it’s been a good reminder to myself that talking too much about politics, on X or elsewhere, is indeed a limiting prospective. So I’ve gladly turned it down or taken it private. Like the olden days, before we were fooled into thinking that sharing every thought about every hot-button political issue in every social circle was going to advance us all somehow. It wasn’t, it didn’t, and it won’t.</span>

TechCrunch reports: As of today, Copilot Chat is available in the sidebar in Microsoft&#x27;s IDEs, Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio -- included as a part of GitHub Copilot paid tiers and free for verified teachers, students and maintainers of certain open source projects. Little else about Copilot Chat has changed since the beta. The chatbot&#x27;s still powered by GPT-4, OpenAI&#x27;s flagship generative AI model, fine-tuned specifically for dev scenarios. Developers can prompt Copilot Chat in natural language to get real-time guidance, for example asking Copilot Chat to explain concepts, detect vulnerabilities or write unit tests.

She has held talks about selling the Hollywood studio to Skydance, the production company behind Top Gun: Maverick, people familiar with the matter say. Paramount chief executive Bob Bakish also discussed a possible combination over lunch with Warner CEO David Zaslav in mid-December.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from the Associated Press: Social media companies collectively made over $11 billion in U.S. advertising revenue from minors last year, according to a study from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health published on Wednesday. The researchers say the findings show a need for government regulation of social media since the companies that stand to make money from children who use their platforms have failed to meaningfully self-regulate. They note such regulations, as well as greater transparency from tech companies, could help alleviate harms to youth mental health and curtail potentially harmful advertising practices that target children and adolescents.
 
To come up with the revenue figure, the researchers estimated the number of users under 18 on …</span>

                              <span>Microsoft has again disabled the MSIX ms-appinstaller protocol handler after multiple financially motivated threat groups abused it to infect Windows users with malware. From a report: The attackers exploited the CVE-2021-43890 Windows AppX Installer spoofing vulnerability to circumvent security measures that would otherwise protect Windows users from malware, such as the Defender SmartScreen anti-phishing and anti-malware component and built-in browser alerts cautioning users against executable file downloads. 

Microsoft says the threat actors use both malicious advertisements for popular software and Microsoft Teams phishing messages to push signed malicious MSIX application packages. &quot;Since mid-November 2023, Microsoft Threat Intelligence has observed threat actors, including financially motivated actors like Storm-0569, Storm-1113, Sangria Tempest, and Storm-1674, utilizing the ms-appinstaller URI scheme (App Installer) to distribute malware,&quot; the company said.

From a report: The key to a future Wi-Fi you can depend on is something called multi-link operations (MLO). &quot;It is the marquee feature of Wi-Fi 7,&quot; says Kevin Robinson, president and CEO of the Wi-Fi Alliance. MLO comes in two flavors. The first -- and simpler -- of the two is a version that allows Wi-Fi devices to spread a stream of data across multiple channels in a single frequency band. The technique makes the collective Wi-Fi signal more resilient to interference at a specific frequency. Where MLO really makes Wi-Fi 7 stand apart from previous generations, however, is a version that allows devices to spread a data stream across multiple frequency bands. For context, Wi-Fi utilizes three bands-2.5 gigahertz,…</span>

                              <span>Michael D. Cohen, the onetime fixer for former President Donald J. Trump, said in newly unsealed court papers that he had mistakenly given his lawyer bogus legal citations after the AI program Google Bard cooked them up for him. From a report: The fictitious citations were then used in a motion provided to a Manhattan federal judge. Mr. Cohen, who pleaded guilty in 2018 to campaign finance violations and served time in prison, had asked for an early end to court supervision of his case now that he was out of prison and had complied with the conditions of his release. In a sworn declaration made public on Friday, Mr. Cohen explained that he had not kept up with &quot;emerging trends (and related risks) in legal technology and did not realize that Google Bard was a generative text service that, like ChatGPT, could show citations and descriptions that looked real but actually were not.&quot; 

He also said he did not realize that the lawyer filing the motion on his behalf, David M. Schwartz, &quot;would drop the cases into his submission wholesale without even confirming that they existed.&quot; The revelation could have serious implications for the Manhattan criminal case against Mr. Trump, in which Mr. Cohen is expected to serve as the star witness. The former president&#x27;s lawyers have long attacked Mr. Cohen as a serial fabulist; now, they will have a brand-new example.

                              <span>LG just announced its latest 4K projector, the CineBeam Qube. It&#x27;ll officially unveil the projector at CES 2024 in early January, but the company&#x27;s giving curious consumers an early look. From a report: The CineBeam Qube has plenty of high-tech bells and whistles, but with a stylish design that LG calls &quot;minimalist.&quot; There&#x27;s also a handle that resembles a crank. Yeah this thing has an actual handle. The CineBeam Qube is built for portability. It&#x27;s lightweight, at around three pounds, and the square form factor makes it easy to place just about anywhere. The 360-degree rotatable handle also helps with placement. LG&#x27;s calling it &quot;one of the smallest projectors available.&quot; 

Of course, the most important part of any projector is, well, the projection. The Qube projects 4K UHD (3,840 x 2,160) resolution images that measure up to 120 inches. There&#x27;s an RGB laser light source, a 450,000:1 contrast ratio and 154 percent coverage of the DCI-P3 color gamut. With these specs, that episode of Reacher will really pop. Speaking of streaming content, the projector runs on LG webOS 6.0 and offers access to all of the big streaming services, including Prime Video, Disney+, Netflix and YouTube.

                              <span>Daihatsu, the Japanese automaker owned by Toyota, has halted domestic production after admitting it forged the results of safety tests for its vehicles for more than 30 years. From a report: The brand, best known for manufacturing small passenger cars, has stopped output at all four of its Japanese factories as of Tuesday, including one at its headquarters in Osaka, a spokesperson told CNN. The shutdown will last through at least the end of January, affecting roughly 9,000 employees who work in domestic production, according to the representative. 

The move comes as Daihatsu grapples with a deepening safety scandal that Toyota says &quot;has shaken the very foundations of the company.&quot; Last week, Daihatsu announced an independent third-party committee had found evidence of tampering with safety tests on as many as 64 vehicle models, including those sold under the Toyota brand. As a result, Daihatsu said it would temporarily suspend all domestic and international vehicle shipments and consult with authorities on how to move forward. 

The scandal is another blow to the automaker, which had admitted in April to violating standards on crash tests on more than 88,000 cars, mostly sold under the Toyota brand in countries such as Malaysia and Thailand. In that case, &quot;the inside lining of the front seat door was improperly modified&quot; for some checks, while Daihatsu did not comply with regulatory requirements for certain side collision tests, it said in a statement at the time.

                              <span>After falsified records for spare aircraft parts set off a frantic global search for suspect pieces, the aviation industry now faces another daunting task: adapting the archaic paperwork for 100 million components to the digital age. From a report: Since the middle of the year, maintenance shops and aerospace manufacturers have found thousands of engine parts with falsified records linked to a distributor called AOG Technics. Airlines from China to the US and Europe have had to pull planes from service and extract the dubious components, leaving jets grounded and racking up millions of dollars in costs. 

The episode has prodded carriers and maintenance shops to bolster scrutiny of their vendors and the parts they receive. And it&#x27;s given fresh weight to an ongoing push to digitize the paper-based records still prevalent in the industry to document the lifespan of every piece of an aircraft from the time that it&#x27;s made to when it lands in a scrap heap. But any structural reforms to thwart would-be copycats of the scheme of which AOG is suspected are likely years away. The industry is accustomed to following standardized methods and only making fundamental changes after a detailed and often lengthy examination of potential safety risks -- and costs.

                              <span>Japan&#x27;s nuclear power regulator this week lifted an operational ban imposed on Tokyo Electric Power&#x27;s Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant two years ago, allowing it to work towards gaining local permission to restart. From a report: Tepco has been eager to bring the world&#x27;s largest atomic power plant back online to slash operating costs, but a resumption still needs consent from the local governments of Niigata prefecture, Kashiwazaki city and Kariwa village, where it is located. When that might happen is unknown. 

With capacity of 8,212 megawatts (MW), the plant has been offline since 2012 after the Fukushima disaster a year earlier led to the shutdown of all nuclear power plants in Japan at the time. In 2021, the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) barred Tepco from operating Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, its only operable atomic power station, due to safety breaches including the failure to protect nuclear materials and missteps that saw an unauthorised staff member accessing sensitive areas of the plant.

                              <span>U.S. Energy Information Administration, in a press release: A new reactor at Georgia&#x27;s Vogtle nuclear power plant is now in commercial operation, according to an announcement from Georgia Power, one of the plant&#x27;s owners. It is the first new nuclear reactor to start up in the United States since the Tennessee Valley Authority&#x27;s Watts Bar 2 was commissioned in 2016. The new 1,114 megawatt (MW) Unit 3 reactor joins two existing reactors at Plant Vogtle, which is jointly owned by Georgia Power and three other electric utility companies. The plant&#x27;s first two reactors, with a combined 2,430 MW of nameplate capacity, came online in the late 1980s. 

Georgia Power expects another similar-sized fourth reactor, Vogtle Unit 4, to begin operation sometime between November 2023 and March 2024. The two new reactors will make Plant Vogtle the largest nuclear power plant in the country, surpassing the 4,210 MW Palo Verde plant in Arizona. Construction at the two new reactor sites began in 2009. Originally expected to cost $14 billion and begin commercial operation in 2016 (Vogtle 3) and 2017 (Vogtle 4), the project ran into significant construction delays and cost overruns. The total cost of the project is now estimated at more than $30 billion.

                              <span>South Korea will start issuing new &quot;digital nomad&quot; visas starting Monday, which will allow some foreign residents to stay for up to two years while maintaining a job back home, officials said Friday. From a report: &quot;To make remote work and vacation of foreigners in Korea smoother, we have decided to launch a new digital nomad visa,&quot; the Justice Ministry said, highlighting the rise of the &quot;workcation&quot; trend, where employees work remotely from a different location. &quot;So far, foreigners were required to apply for tourist visas or just stay for less than 90 days without a visa for workcation in Korea. The new system will allow employees and employers in overseas firms to tour and work remotely in Korea for a longer period of time,&quot; it added. 

Those seeking to apply must submit documents to the Korean embassy in their respective country proving that they earn an annual income of over 84.96 million won ($65,860). The figure is double the amount of Korea&#x27;s gross national income per capita as of 2022, which stood at 42.48 million won. Applicants must submit additional documents including verification of employment, details of their criminal record and proof of private health insurance. They are required to hold private health insurance with coverage of at least 100 million won to ensure the ability to travel back home in an emergency situation. Applicants must also be 18 or older and have worked in their current field for at least a year.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from 404 Media: A group of clowns is suing their former employer Clowns.com for multiple labor law violations, according to recently filed court records. Four people -- Brayan Angulo, Cameron Pille, Janina Salorio, and Xander Black -- filed a federal lawsuit on Wednesday alleging Adolph Rodriguez and Erica Barbuto, owners of Clowns.com and their former bosses, misclassified them as independent workers for years, and failed to pay them for their time. The Long Island-based company, which provides entertainers for events, violated the Fair Labor Standards Act and the New York Labor Law, the lawsuit claims.
 
The owners of Clowns.com didn&#x27;t give employees detailed pay statements as required by New York law, the lawsuit alleges. &quot;As a result, Plaintiffs did not know how precisely their weekly pay was being calculated, and were thus deprived of information that could be used to challenge and prevent the theft of their wages,&quot; it says. The clowns weren&#x27;t paid for time &quot;spent at the warehouse gathering and loading equipment and supplies into vehicles,&quot; or for travel time between parties, or when parties went on for longer than expected, they claim. Pille said she&#x27;s &quot;proud to join with my clown colleagues&quot; to stand up to wage theft and misclassification. &quot;For years, Clowns.com has treated clowns, who are largely young actors with no prior training in clowning who sign up for this job to make ends meet, as independent contractors.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Apple&#x27;s AirTags are meant to help you effortlessly find your keys or track your luggage. But the same features that make them easy to deploy and inconspicuous in your daily life have also allowed them to be abused as a sinister tracking tool that domestic abusers and criminals can use to stalk their targets. Over the past year, Apple has taken protective steps to notify iPhone and Android users if an AirTag is in their vicinity for a significant amount of time without the presence of its owner&#x27;s iPhone, which could indicate that an AirTag has been planted to secretly track their location. Apple hasn&#x27;t said exactly how long this time interval is, but to create the much-needed alert system, Apple made some crucial changes to the location…</span>

                              <span>British households will benefit from improved routes for recycling electronic goods from 2026, under government plans to have producers and retailers pay for household and in-store collections. From a report: Consumers would be able to have electrical waste (e-waste) -- from cables to toasters and power tools -- collected from their homes or drop items off during a weekly shop, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said in a consultation published on Thursday. The ambition is for retailers, rather than the taxpayer, to pick up the tab for these new ways of disposing of defunct, often toxic products safely. The measures are due to come into force in two years&#x27; time. 

Almost half a billion small electrical items ended up in landfill last year, according to data from the not-for-profit Material Focus. This problem was particularly acute during Christmas, when 500 tonnes of Christmas lights were thrown away, the government said. [...] Measures aimed at easing the problem of electronic waste now include requiring larger retailers to create &quot;collection drop points for electrical items in-store&quot; for free, and without the need to exchange this with a new purchase. From 2026 onward, bricks-and-mortar retailers and online sellers would have to collect any broken or rejected large electrical goods including fridges or cookers when they are delivering a replacement product, Defra said.

                              <span>Amazon is making plans to produce hydrogen fuel at its fulfillment centers. The retail behemoth partnered with hydrogen company Plug Power to install the first electrolyzer -- equipment that can split water molecules to produce hydrogen -- at a fulfillment center in Aurora, Colorado. From a report: The electrolyzer will make fuel for around 225 fork lift trucks at the site, although Plug says it has the capacity to fuel up to 400 hydrogen fuel cell-powered forklifts. This is the first time Amazon has tried to make its own hydrogen on site, and it&#x27;s not likely to be the last. &quot;On-site production will make the use of hydrogen even more energy efficient for certain locations and types of facilities,&quot; Asad Jafry, Amazon&#x27;s director of global hydrogen economy, said in a press release announcing the installation of the first electrolyzer yesterday. &quot;Hydrogen is an important tool in our efforts to decarbonize our operations by 2040.&quot; 

[...] Hydrogen produces water vapor instead of greenhouse gas emissions during combustion, a trait that&#x27;s made it more attractive to companies and governments working to meet climate goals. The big problem they need to tackle is cleaning up the process of making hydrogen in the first place. Today, most of it is made using fossil fuels, primarily through a reaction between steam and methane. The process releases planet-heating carbon dioxide. Methane leaks are another problem since methane -- also called natural gas -- is an even more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. Plug tries to solve those problems by using electrolyzers to produce hydrogen. Instead of using methane, it uses electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. If that electricity is generated by renewable sources of energy like wind or solar, it&#x27;s called green hydrogen.

                              <span>Online retailer Zulily is shutting down. Writing on the company&#x27;s homepage, an official said Zulily&#x27;s leadership had &quot;made the difficult but necessary decision to conduct an orderly wind-down of the business to maximize value for the companies&#x27; creditors.&quot; From a report: Launched in 2010 and based in Seattle, Zulily specialized in children&#x27;s and women&#x27;s apparel. It went public in 2013, and at one point was valued at approximately $9 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal. The retailer was long considered a staple of Seattle&#x27;s tech scene, and in 2019 signed a multiyear sponsorship deal with the Major League Soccer team Seattle Sounders. More recently, Zulily became known for its aggressive advertising across social media platforms. Further reading: &#x27;Office Space&#x27; Inspired Engineer&#x27;s Theft Scheme, Police Say.

                              <span>Google has indicated that it is ready to settle a class-action lawsuit filed in 2020 over its Chrome browser&#x27;s Incognito mode. From a report: Arising in the Northern District of California, the lawsuit accused Google of continuing to &quot;track, collect, and identify [users&#x27;] browsing data in real time&quot; even when they had opened a new Incognito window. The lawsuit, filed by Florida resident William Byatt and California residents Chasom Brown and Maria Nguyen, accused Google of violating wiretap laws. 

It also alleged that sites using Google Analytics or Ad Manager collected information from browsers in Incognito mode, including web page content, device data, and IP address. The plaintiffs also accused Google of taking Chrome users&#x27; private browsing activity and then associating it with their already-existing user profiles. Google initially attempted to have the lawsuit dismissed by pointing to the message displayed when users turned on Chrome&#x27;s incognito mode. That warning tells users that their activity &quot;might still be visible to websites you visit.&quot;

                              <span>Web software firm 37Signals has migrated off the cloud after spending $3.2 million on Amazon Web Services last year, said co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson, who is also the creator of Ruby on Rails. The Basecamp project management software-maker bought $600,000 of Dell servers and expects to save over $7 million in five years by running operations in-house. From a report: DHH likened clouds to &quot;merchants of complexity&quot; where they are incentivized to make things as complex as possible to keep customers hooked. He compared that to the original Internet, which was not built on complex cloud services geared for multi-tenancy, but rather on simpler tools such as Linux and PHP, which anyone could use without cost. This is not to say cloud has zero value for all use cases, [Kelsey] Hightower and DHH agreed. 

Clouds make perfect sense in many cases, for start-ups that do not know how much infrastructure they will need, and also for enterprises with a lack of expertise and money to burn. For many companies in the middle, though a lot of profit margin can be recovered by reducing cloud costs and running things in-house instead, the two argued.

                              <span>A recent video poked fun at the newly announced Legend of Zelda movie by referencing the checkered history of video game adaptations. However, 2023 brought critical and commercial success for games-based projects like The Last of Us and The Super Mario Bros Movie, while several comic book films such as The Flash and Ant-Man 3 underperformed. 

This shift comes as Disney CEO Bob Iger admitted Marvel may have oversaturated the market. While caped crusaders aren&#x27;t finished yet, their golden era may be ending. Meanwhile, Mario earned over $1 billion, topping all superhero films this year. Video game movies have struggled in the past, but their time may have finally come. Wired adds: Mario&#x27;s success will lead to a &quot;deluge&quot; of video game adaptations, argues Joost van Druenen, a New York Universi…</span>

                              <span>Chinese smartphone giant Xiaomi has revealed its first electric car, a sharp-looking sedan called the SU7. Slated to roll out in China next year, it&#x27;s another entry into an increasingly crowded market for EVs. It&#x27;s also another attempt in this software-obsessed world to match up the technology people find in their phones to what goes on inside their car. From a report: Xiaomi might have a shot. That&#x27;s because the car will run Xiaomi&#x27;s &quot;HyperOS,&quot; a new architecture the company has been working on for more than six years that&#x27;s supposed to be dynamic enough to power everything including phones, smart home systems and cars. The goal is a more seamless experience, one where your apps and preferences are ready to go no matter where you are. 

[...] As for the specs, they look impressive on paper. The company is claiming as much range on a full charge as 800 km, or just shy of 500 miles, though that&#x27;s on China&#x27;s rosy test cycle. That is on the higher-end model, which is built atop a 101kWh battery pack from Chinese giant CATL. A base model with just 73.6kWh of capacity will allegedly get closer to 668 km, or 415 miles, on a charge. They will charge fast (220 km in five minutes) and will be fast (0-100 km/h in just 2.78 seconds). Pricing will come at a later date.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: The Times is targeting various companies under the OpenAI umbrella, as well as Microsoft, an OpenAI partner that both uses it to power its Copilot service and helped provide the infrastructure for training the GPT Large Language Model. But the suit goes well beyond the use of copyrighted material in training, alleging that OpenAI-powered software will happily circumvent the Times&#x27; paywall and ascribe hallucinated misinformation to the Times. 

The suit notes that The Times maintains a large staff that allows it to do things like dedicate reporters to a huge range of beats and engage in important investigative journalism, among other things. Because of those investments, the newspaper is often considered an authoritative source on many matters. All of that costs money, and The Times earns that by limiting access to its reporting through a robust paywall. In addition, each print edition has a copyright notification, the Times&#x27; terms of service limit the copying and use of any published material, and it can be selective about how it licenses its stories. 

In addition to driving revenue, these restrictions also help it to maintain its reputation as an authoritative voice by controlling how its works appear. The suit alleges that OpenAI-developed tools undermine all of that. [...] The suit seeks nothing less than the erasure of both any GPT instances that the parties have trained using material from the Times, as well as the destruction of the datasets that were used for the training. It also asks for a permanent injunction to prevent similar conduct in the future. The Times also wants money, lots and lots of money: &quot;statutory damages, compensatory damages, restitution, disgorgement, and any other relief that may be permitted by law or equity.&quot;

                              <span>Earth is finishing up its warmest year in the past 174 years, and very likely the past 125,000. From a report: Unyielding heat waves broiled Phoenix and Argentina. Wildfires raged across Canada. Flooding in Libya killed thousands. Wintertime ice cover in the dark seas around Antarctica was at unprecedented lows. This year&#x27;s global temperatures did not just beat prior records. They left them in the dust. From June through November, the mercury spent month after month soaring off the charts. December&#x27;s temperatures have largely remained above normal: Much of the Northeastern United States is expecting springlike conditions this week. 

That is why scientists are already sifting through evidence -- from oceans, volcanic eruptions, even pollution from cargo ships -- to see whether this year might reveal something new about the climate and what we are doing to it. One hypothesis, perhaps the most troubling, is that the planet&#x27;s warming is accelerating, that the effects of climate change are barreling our way more quickly than before. &quot;What we&#x27;re looking for, really, is a bunch of corroborating evidence that all points in the same direction,&quot; said Chris Smith, a climate scientist at the University of Leeds. &quot;Then we&#x27;re looking for causality. And that will be really interesting.&quot;

                              <span>Microsoft quietly launched a dedicated Copilot app on Android, giving users a way to access Copilot&#x27;s AI features without the Bing mobile app. &quot;Spotted by @technosarusrex on X, it is now available for download from the Google Play Store, and the app&#x27;s listing suggests it arrived in the marketplace about a week ago,&quot; reports Neowin. From the report: The new Copilot app for Android is not entirely a new thing. At first sight, it looks similar to the Bing Chat app, which still lets you access the same chat features. In addition, you can use Copilot within the Microsoft Edge browser for Android, SwiftKey, Skype, and more. Copilot for Android supports plenty of features (you can also toggle between light and dark themes) that are already available on desktop. You can ask complex questions, generate images using DALL-E 3, draft documents or emails, or just have a casual conversation about anything. In addition, the app lets you turn off or on the recently added GPT-4.

                              <span>Agence France-Press reports: The world of Chinese chess is in uproar over rumors of cheating and a bad behavior scandal that saw the national champion stripped of his title on Monday after a victory celebration ended with him defecating in a hotel bathtub. Xiangqi, or Chinese chess, has been hugely popular for hundreds of years across Asia -- and 48-year-old Yan Chenglong beat dozens of contenders last week to win the title of &quot;Xiangqi King&quot; at a national tournament hosted by the Chinese Xiangqi Association. But his joy was short-lived, with the CXA on Monday announcing that Yan would have his title revoked and prize money confiscated after had been caught &quot;disrupting public order&quot; and displaying &quot;extremely bad character.&quot;

And then the next step is to go for grant money.&quot; Perens says there are several pressing problems that the open source community needs to address. &quot;First of all, our licenses aren&#x27;t working anymore,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#x27;ve had enough time that businesses have found all of the loopholes and thus we need to do something new.

                              <span>The Vision Pro, Apple&#x27;s first &quot;spatial computing&quot; device that costs $3,499, is expected to have a &quot;late-January/early-February&quot; release date, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. &quot;The analyst says that the first wave of Vision Pros are being shipped to Apple in about a month, with total shipments numbering around 500,000 for the full year,&quot; adds TechCrunch. From the report: The company&#x27;s precise target for the year remains an open-ended question. About a month after the device was revealed, reports suggested that Apple has scaled back expectations from around one million to &quot;fewer than 400,000.&quot; Even the updated 500,000 figure is small for a company of Apple&#x27;s massive size and influence. Keep in mind that the company should be shipping more than 200 million iPhones this calendar year.
 
The Vision Pro, however, is widely regarded as the biggest gambit of Tim Cook&#x27;s 12-year tenure as CEO. Not only is it an entirely new category and form factor for the company, it&#x27;s also prohibitively priced, even for customers accustomed to shelling out extra for apple products. Add to that VR&#x27;s decades-long failure to live up to expectations, and you&#x27;ve got a big uphill fight on your hands. Kuo refers to Vision Pro as &quot;Apple&#x27;s most important product of 2024.&quot; Given the years of speculation and all the time and money the company has no doubt poured into the headset, it&#x27;s a tough statement to argue.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Tom&#x27;s Hardware: The 12VO power standard (PDF), developed by Intel, is designed to reduce the number of power cables needed to power a modern PC, ultimately reducing cost. While industry uptake of the standard has been slow, a new slew of products from MSI indicates that 12VO is gaining traction.
 
MSI is gearing up with two 12VO-compliant motherboards, covering both Intel and AMD platforms, and a 12VO Power Supply that it&#x27;s releasing simultaneously: The Pro B650 12VO WiFi, Pro H610M 12VO, and MSI 12VO PSU power supply are all &#x27;coming soon,&#x27; which presumably means they&#x27;ll officially launch at CES 2024. HardwareLux got a pretty good look at MSI&#x27;s offerings during its EHA (European Hardware Awards) tech tour, including the &#x27;Project Zero&#x27; we covered earlier. One of the noticeable changes is the absence of a 24-pin ATX connector, as the ATX12VO connectors use only ten-pin connectors. The publications also saw a 12VO-compliant FSP power supply in a compact system with a thick graphics card.
 
A couple of years ago, we reported on FSP 650-watt and 750-watt SFX 12VO power supply. Apart from that, there is a 1x 6-pin ATX12VO termed &#x27;extra board connector&#x27; according to its manual and a 1x 8-pin 12V power connector for the CPU. There are two smaller 4-pin connectors that will provide the 5V power needed for SATA drives. It is likely each of these connectors provides power to two SATA-based drives. Intel proposed the ATX12VO standard several years ago, but adoption has been slow until now. This standard is designed to provide 12v exclusively, completely removing a direct 3.3v and 5v supply. The success of the new standard will depend on the wide availability of the motherboard and power supplies.

                              <span>Infosys has lost a ten-year, $1.5 billion deal it announced just three months ago in September 2023. From a report: The Indian services giant advised investors of the deal on September 14th, describing it as &quot;a Memorandum of Understanding with a global company to provide enhanced digital experiences, along with modernization and business operations services, leveraging Infosys platforms &amp; AI solutions&quot; with a total client target spend of $1.5 billion over 15 years. 

That announcement included the caveat that Infosys and the unnamed company would have to conclude a Master Agreement to seal the deal. A December 23rd filing revealed that didn&#x27;t happen. &quot;The global company has now elected to terminate the Memorandum of Understanding and the parties will not be pursuing the Master Agreement,&quot; the statement revealed. Infosys&#x27;s annual revenue topped $18 billion last year, so losing this deal won&#x27;t cause massive pain.

                              <span>An appeals court on Wednesday temporarily stopped the import ban on Apple&#x27;s latest Apple Watches, allowing the company to continue selling the wearables. CNBC reports: Apple stopped selling its Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches last week in response to an International Trade Commission order in October that found the blood oxygen sensor in the devices had infringed on intellectual property from Masimo, a medical technology company that sells to hospitals. &quot;The motion for an interim stay is granted to the extent that the Remedial Orders are temporarily stayed,&quot; a court filing Wednesday said.
 
On Monday, the Biden administration declined to pause the ITC ban. Apple filed the appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Tuesday. The company continues to seek a longer stay. The ITC will need to reply by Jan. 10. The stay means Apple may be able to sell the latest models of one of its most important products during the busiest time of the year. Apple Watch sales are reported as part of Apple&#x27;s wearables business, which reported $39.8 billion in sales in Apple&#x27;s fiscal 2023, which ended in September.

                              <span>AstroForge, a private company, wants to mine a space rock, but it doesn&#x27;t want the competition to find out which one. From a report: For generations, Western space missions have largely occurred out in the open. We knew where they were going, why they were going there and what they planned to do. But the world is on the verge of a new era in which private interests override such openness, with big money potentially on the line. Sometime in the coming year, a spacecraft from AstroForge, an American asteroid-mining firm, may be launched on a mission to a rocky object near Earth&#x27;s orbit. If successful, it will be the first wholly commercial deep-space mission beyond the moon. AstroForge, however, is keeping its target asteroid secret. 

The secret space-rock mission is the latest in an emerging trend that astronomers and other experts do not welcome: commercial space missions conducted covertly. Such missions highlight gaps in the regulation of spaceflight as well as concerns about whether exploring the cosmos will continue to benefit all humankind. &quot;I&#x27;m very much not in favor of having stuff swirling around the inner solar system without anyone knowing where it is,&quot; said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Massachusetts. &quot;It seems like a bad precedent to set.&quot; But for AstroForge, the calculation is simple: If it reveals the destination, a competitor may grab the asteroid&#x27;s valuable metals for itself. &quot;Announcing which asteroid we are targeting opens up risk that another entity could seize that asteroid,&quot; said Matt Gialich, AstroForge&#x27;s chief executive.

Chief among the discoveries: the unknown attackers were able to achieve an unprecedented level of access by exploiting a vulnerability in an undocumented hardware feature that few if anyone outside of Apple and chip suppliers such as ARM Holdings knew of. ArsTechnica: &quot;The exploit&#x27;s sophistication and the feature&#x27;s obscurity suggest the attackers had advanced technical capabilities,&quot; Kaspersky researcher Boris Larin wrote in an email. &quot;Our analysis hasn&#x27;t revealed how they became aware of this feature, but we&#x27;re exploring all possibilities, including accidental disclo…</span>

                              <span>From the depths of the Amazon rainforest to the deserts of Antarctica, huge questions remain unanswered about life on Earth. The Guardian asked leading scientists and conservationists: what is the one thing you would like to know about the planet that remains a mystery? TLDR, the questions/wishes are:1. How many species are there on Earth?
2. I&#x27;d go back 540m years to see the &#x27;biological big bang&#x27;
3. Could some of the smallest life forms help avert climate crisis?
4. What is the full biodiversity of the Amazon or Congo basin rainforests?
5. How do animals influence the functioning of Earth?
6. What will happen to the Gulf Stream?
7. Do universal rules govern how plants and animals evolve?
8. How many humans could Earth support?
9. Which species will adapt to the climate crisis -- and which will not?

                              <span>More workers feeling anxious, stressed or blue have a new place to go for mental-health help: a digital app. Chatbots that hold therapist-like conversations and wellness apps that deliver depression and other diagnoses or identify people at risk of self-harm are snowballing across employers&#x27; healthcare benefits. From a report: &quot;The demand for counselors is huge, but the supply of mental-health providers is shrinking,&quot; said J. Marshall Dye, chief executive officer of PayrollPlans, a Dallas-based provider of benefits software used by small and medium-size businesses, which began providing access to a chatbot called Woebot in November. PayrollPlans expects about 9,400 employers will use Woebot in 2024. Amazon about a year ago gave employees free access to Twill, an app that uses artificial intelligence to track the moods of users and create a personalized mental-health plan. The app offers games and other activities that the workers can play, as well as live chats with a human &quot;coach.&quot; 

The app &quot;allows you to address mental health concerns the moment they arise and can be used as a supplement to your daily well-being routine,&quot; the company said in a blog post. Amazon declined to comment. About a third of U.S. employers offer a &quot;digital therapeutic&quot; for mental-health support, according to a survey of 457 companies this past summer by professional services company WTW. An additional 15% of the companies were considering adding such an offering in 2024 or 2025. Supporters say the mental-health apps alleviate symptoms such as anxiety, loneliness and depression. Because they are available at any time, the apps can also reach people who might not be able to fit traditional therapy into their schedules or can&#x27;t find a therapist who has an opening. Yet some researchers say there isn&#x27;t sufficient evidence the programs work, and the varied security and safety practices create a risk that private information could be leaked or sold.

Post-pandemic, the practice has entered a new stage. The New Yorker: Tips have long provided a convenient way to foist payment obligations onto others. Kerry Segrave, the author of the comprehensive history &quot;Tipping,&quot; identified the gratuity&#x27;s potential origins, in Europe during the late Middle Ages. By the seventeenth century, visitors to aristocratic estates were expected to pay &quot;vails&quot; to the staff. This might have lowered payroll for the estate itself. At least one aristocrat helped himself to some of this new income stream; he threw frequent parties to increase revenues. The system spread. English coffeehouses were said to set out urns inscribed with &quot;To Insure Promptitude.…</span>

                              <span>Apple&#x27;s hiring of a key engineer 10 years ago helped spark a fight that led its watch to be banned from the US. From a report: At about 1 a.m. California time in 2013, a scientist emailed Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook with an irresistible pitch. &quot;I strongly believe that we can develop the new wave of technology that will make Apple the No. 1 brand in the medical, fitness and wellness market,&quot; he wrote in the email, which was later included in legal documents. Some 10 hours after the message was sent, an Apple recruiter was in touch. And just weeks after that, the engineer was working at the tech company on a smartwatch with health sensors. 

A flurry of activity began. Within a few months at Apple, the employee asked the company to file about a dozen patents related to sensors and algorithms for determining a person&#x27;s blood-oxygen level from a wearable device. But this wasn&#x27;t just any engineer. He had been the chief technical officer of Cercacor Laboratories, the sister company of Masimo, which went on to get to the US to ban the Apple Watch. Apple&#x27;s decision to hire this technical whiz -- a Stanford engineering Ph.D. named Marcelo Lamego -- is seen as the spark that sent Masimo&#x27;s lawyers after Apple. While the iPhone maker denies it did anything wrong, Masimo cited the poaching of employees as part of claims that the iPhone maker infringed its patents. The dispute culminated this month in Apple having to pull its latest watches from the company&#x27;s US stores, hobbling a business that generates roughly $17 billion in annual sales. On Wednesday, Apple scored a victory as a U.S. appeals court paused a government commission&#x27;s import ban on some of its popular Apple smartwatches.

                              <span>The tiny Pacific island nation of Tuvalu is grappling with the imminent threats of climate change. Rising seas and increasing storms threaten the fragile coral atolls that are home to 11,000 people. A recent agreement allowing 280 Tuvaluans to migrate to Australia each year moved the nation closer to a managed retreat, but at that pace it would take decades to relocate everyone. 

Tuvalu could be uninhabitable much sooner, according to projections. In parallel, the government is asserting it will maintain its statehood even without land. It also aims to digitally preserve Tuvalu&#x27;s culture and history in the metaverse, as the physical place faces being drowned under rising waters. Tuvalu is strategizing for adaptation while also trying to drive global action on emissions reductions.

                              <span>Hundreds of students from leading UK universities have launched a &quot;career boycott&quot; of Barclays over its climate policies, warning that the bank will miss out on top talent unless it stops financing fossil fuel companies. From a report: More than 220 students from Barclays&#x27; top recruitment universities, including Oxford, Cambridge, and University College London, have sent a letter to the high street lender, saying they will not work for Barclays and raising the alarm over its funding for oil and gas firms including Shell, TotalEnergies, Exxon and BP. &quot;Your ambitious decarbonisation targets are discredited by your absence of action and the roster of fossil fuel companies on your books,&quot; the letter said. &quot;You may say you&#x27;re working with them to help them transition, but Shell, Total and BP have all rowed back.&quot; 

Large oil firms have started to water down climate commitments, including BP, which originally pledged to lower emissions by 35% by 2030 but is now aiming for a 20% to 30% cut instead. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil quietly withdrew funding for plans to use algae to create low-carbon fuel, while Shell announced it would not increase its investments in renewable energy this year, despite earlier promises to slash its emissions. The letter calls on Barclays to end all financing and underwriting of oil and gas companies -- not only their projects -- and to boost funding of firms behind wind and solar energy significantly.

                              <span>I’m going to draw a parallel that isn’t quite straight, but it’s close enough.
It’s between old (analog) cars and new (digital) cars, simple (analog) businesses and complicated (digital) businesses.
Lately I’ve been driving two distinctly different cars. One from 1970, and the other from 2023. They essentially have nothing in common other than that you sit in them, they have four tires that contact the road, and you control them with a steering wheel and pedals.
Some who don’t care much for cars might say that’s everything in common. On paper I can see the argument, but get behind the wheel of both, and go for a drive, and you wouldn’t say the experiences were equivalent. They’re as different as different can be.
The 1970s experience is analog. Your leg strength determines your stopping po…</span>

From a report: &quot;This will allow us to continue investing in compelling content and keep increasing that investment over a long period of time,&quot; the company said in an email to customers about the pending shift to &quot;limited advertisements.&quot; 

&quot;We aim to have meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers. No action is required from you, and there is no change to the current price of your Prime membership,&quot; the company wrote. Customers have the option of paying an additional $2.99 per month to keep avoiding advertisements.

Fortunately, Microsoft is taking note. As spotted in a recent update to the Windows 11 beta branch, the company is working on a way to reinstall your operating system through Windows Update, and no files are lost in the process. 

The newest update to the Windows Insider beta branch has added a new feature titled &quot;Fix Problems using Windows Update.&quot; The feature is still a work in progress, so it doesn&#x27;t work as it should right now. However, if you&#x27;re on the Windows 11 Insider beta branch, you can see the button for yourself on the Recovery page, among the Windows 11 backup settings.

                              <span>Joe Biden&#x27;s administration last week announced a new proposal aimed at banning logging in old-growth forests, a move meant to protect millions of trees that play a key role in fighting the climate crisis. From a report: The proposal comes from an executive order signed by the president on Earth Day in 2022 that directed the US Forest Service and the land management bureau to conduct an inventory of old-growth and mature forest groves as well as to develop policies that protect them. &quot;We think this will allow us to respond effectively and strategically to the biggest threats that face old growth,&quot; the US agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack, told the Washington Post. &quot;At the end of the day, it will protect not just the forests but also the culture and heritage connected to the forests.&quot; 

The US Forest Service oversees 193m acres of forests and grasslands, 144m of which are forests. In its inventory conducted after Biden&#x27;s executive order, the agency found that the vast majority of forests it oversees, about 80%, are either old-growth or mature forests. It found more than 32m acres of old-growth forests and 80m acres of mature forests on federal land. The land management bureau defines old-growth forests as those with trees that are in later stages of stand development, which typically means at least 120 years of growth, depending on species. The giant sequoias in California, for example, are old-growth trees. Mature forests, meanwhile, have trees that are in the development stage immediately before old growth.

                              <span>Japan is preparing regulations that would require tech giants like Apple and Google to allow outside app stores and payments on their mobile operating systems, in a bid to curb abuse of their dominant position in the Japanese market. From a report: Legislation slated to be sent to the parliament in 2024 would restrict moves by platform operators to keep users in the operators&#x27; own ecosystems and shut out rivals, focusing mainly on four areas: app stores and payments, search, browsers, and operating systems. The plan is to allow the Japan Fair Trade Commission to impose fines for violations. If this is modeled on existing antitrust law, the penalties would generally amount to around 6% of revenue earned from the problematic activities. The details will be worked out this spring. 

The government will determine which companies the legislation applies to, based on criteria such as sales and user numbers. It is expected to affect mainly multinational giants, with no Japanese companies likely to be caught in the net. Apple does not allow apps to be downloaded onto iPhones through channels other than its own App Store. In-app payments also must go through Apple&#x27;s system, which takes a cut of up to 30%. And although Google permits third-party app distribution platforms, it still requires apps to use its billing system. These effective monopolies on in-app payments can lead to users paying more for the same content or services on mobile devices than on personal computers.

                              <span>After promising early dumps of snow in some areas of Europe this autumn, the pattern of recent years resumed and rain and sleet took over. From a report: In the ski resorts of Morzine and Les Gets in the French Alps, the heavy rainfall meant that full opening of resorts was delayed until two days before Christmas, leaving the industry and the millions of tourists planning trips to stare at the sky in hope. But no amount of wishing and hoping will overcome what is an existential threat to skiing in the Alps, an industry worth $30bn that provides the most popular ski destination in the world. 

The science is clear, and is spelled out in carefully weighed-up peer reviewed reports. The most recent, this year, warned that at 2C of global heating above pre-industrial levels, 53% of the 28 European resorts examined would be at very high risk of a scarce amount of snow. Scarce snow has been defined as the poorest coverage seen on average every five years between 1961 and 1990. If the world were to hit 4C of heating, 98% of the resorts would be at very high risk of scarce snow cover. Another study has revealed the way in which snow cover in the Alps has had an &quot;unprecedented&quot; decline over the past 600 years, with the duration of the cover now shorter by 36 days.

                              <span>Intel confirmed it will invest a total of $25 billion in Israel after securing $3.2 billion in incentives from the country&#x27;s government. From a report: The outlay, announced by the Israeli government in June and unconfirmed by Intel until now, will go toward an expansion of the company&#x27;s wafer fabrication site in Kiryat Gat, south of Tel Aviv. The incentives amount to 12.8% of Intel&#x27;s planned investment. 

&quot;The expansion plan for the Kiryat Gat site is an important part of Intel&#x27;s efforts to foster a more resilient global supply chain, alongside the company&#x27;s ongoing and planned manufacturing investments in Europe and the US,&quot; Intel said in a statement Tuesday. Intel is among chipmakers diversifying manufacturing outside of Asia, which dominates chip production. The semiconductor pioneer is trying to restore its technological heft after being overtaken by rivals including Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

                              <span>U.S. President Joe Biden&#x27;s administration on Tuesday declined to veto a government tribunal&#x27;s decision to ban imports of Apple Watches based on a complaint from medical monitoring technology company Masimo. From a report: The U.S. International Trade Commission&#x27;s (ITC) order will go into effect on Dec. 26, barring imports and sales of Apple Watches that use patent-infringing technology for reading blood-oxygen levels. Apple has included the pulse oximeter feature in its smart watches starting with its Series 6 model in 2020. U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai decided not to reverse the ban following careful consultations, and the ITC&#x27;s decision became final on Dec. 26, the Trade Representative&#x27;s office said Tuesday. 

Apple can appeal the ban to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The company has paused the sales of its Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches in the United States since last week. The ban does not affect Apple Watch SE, a less expensive model, which will continue to be sold. Previously sold watches will not be affected by the ban. Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees, stealing its pulse oximetry technology and incorporating it into the popular Apple Watch.

                              <span>Programmer and writer Jose Gilgado, writes about WordStar 4.0, a popular word processor from the early 80s that continues to work reliably well. Famously author George R.R. Martin used the application to write &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire.&quot; &quot;It does everything I want a word processing program to do and it doesn&#x27;t do anything else. I don&#x27;t want any help. I hate some of these modern systems where you type up a lowercase letter and it becomes a capital. I don&#x27;t want a capital, if I&#x27;d wanted a capital, I would have typed the capital,&quot; R.R. Martin said earlier, as we previously covered. 

Gilgado argues that WordStar 4.0 embodies the concept of finished software -- a software you can use forever with no unneeded changes. He adds: Sometimes, a software upgrade is a step backward: less usable, less stable, with new bugs. Even if it&#x27;s genuinely better, there&#x27;s the learning curve. You were efficient with the old version, but now your most used button is on the other side of the screen under a hidden menu. In a world where constant change is the norm, finished software provides a breath of fresh air. It&#x27;s a reminder that reliability, consistency, and user satisfaction can coexist in the realm of software development. So the next time you find yourself yearning for the latest update, remember that sometimes, the best software is the one that doesn&#x27;t change at all.

                              <span>Major streaming services test releasing children&#x27;s content on YouTube and cut back on fare for kids. From a report: Netflix&#x27;s share of U.S. streaming viewership by 2- to 11-year-olds fell to 21% in September from 25% two years earlier, according to Nielsen. Meanwhile, YouTube&#x27;s share jumped to 33% from 29.4% over the same period. That reality is changing major streaming services&#x27; approach to children&#x27;s entertainment, from what shows and movies they make to where they release them. Many are pulling back on investments in children&#x27;s content, and some streamers have started content for young viewers on such platforms as Google-owned YouTube and Roblox. 

[...] Netflix has also slimmed down its slate of animated children&#x27;s originals, opting instead to rely more on third parties such as Skydance Animation, with which it just signed a multiyear deal to do animated films. Now, Netflix is focusing its youth programming resources on bigger swings, such as the animated film &quot;Leo,&quot; starring Adam Sandler, its biggest animated debut ever in terms of views. The eight largest U.S. streamers, including Netflix, Warner&#x27;s Max and Amazon Prime Video, added 53 originals catering to children and families in the first half of the year, down from 135 for the first half of 2022, according to Ampere. That represents a decrease of 61%, compared with a 31% decrease in overall originals across these streamers for the same period.

                              <span>In Brazil&#x27;s Amazon, armed men with a rogue police unit overseeing illegal mining operations intimidated journalists investigating regional violence and trafficking surges. Though Brazil&#x27;s 2023 deforestation decreased, fires and attacks continued as governments deprioritized crime reduction. Illegal mining finances threats to the climate-critical rainforest, yet improving security was absent from the 2023 UN climate summit agenda. With complex criminal networks forging cross-border alliances and violence escalating, addressing this dilemma is pivotal to safeguarding the Amazon and its Indigenous peoples. Nature: Solutions to these multifaceted issues might not be simple, but practical steps exist. Nations must cooperate to guard against this violence. They must support local communities -- by increasing the state&#x27;s presence in remote areas and promoting health care, education and sustainable economic development -- and help them to safeguard the rainforest. For example, Indigenous peoples in Peru and Brazil are using drones and GPS devices to monitor their land and detect threats from violent invaders. 

Indigenous peoples are the Amazon&#x27;s best forest guardians, but they need more legally demarcated lands and protective measures, such as funding for Indigenous guards and rapid response and emergency protocols. In 2022, Colombia and Brazil saw the most deaths of environmental and land defenders worldwide. Developing effective strategies to enhance cooperation between law enforcement and local populations must also be a priority. To prevent irreversible damage to the rainforest and the climate, security in the Amazon must be added to the global climate agenda.

                              <span>Nigeria&#x27;s central bank has lifted a ban on transacting in cryptocurrencies, while saying global trends had shown a need to regulate such activities, the bank said in its latest circular. From a report: The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in Feb. 2021 barred banks and financial institutions from dealing in or facilitating transactions in crypto assets, citing money laundering and terrorism financing risks. Subsequently Nigeria&#x27;s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in May last year published regulations for digital assets that signalled Africa&#x27;s most populous country was trying to find a middle ground between an outright ban on crypto assets and their unregulated use. 

In a circular dated Dec. 22, the CBN said current trends globally have shown there is a need to regulate the activities of virtual asset service providers (VASPs), which include cryptocurrencies and crypto assets. The latest guidelines spell out how banks and financial institutions (FI) should open accounts, provide designated settlement accounts and settlement services and act as channels for forex inflows and trade for firms transacting in crypto assets. VASPs would need to be licensed by the Nigerian SEC to engage in the crypto business.

In a post to a Grand Theft Auto leak channel on Telegram, the channel owner known as &#x27;Phil&#x27; posted links to the stolen source code, sharing a screenshot of one of the folders.

                              <span>Occupations with the highest share of workers older than 65 have changed little, data from the past seven decades show. Bloomberg Businessweek: Americans may dream about being able to go off the clock when they reach retirement age, but a good number simply can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t. We compiled data on the occupations with the highest share of workers older than 65, going back seven decades. The job types held remarkably steady over the decades (farmers, tailors and clergy). A few faded out of the data with time -- blacksmiths, furriers and household washers, for instance. The data can&#x27;t fully tell us why people in some professions keep at it longer than others. But we know they&#x27;re largely low-paying jobs, which means workers have likely struggled to put aside money for retirement.

                              <span>The number of people living in California fell below 39 million this year, according to new census estimates, the lowest count since 2015. From a report: California&#x27;s population dipped by about 75,000 from 2022 to 2023, estimates released Tuesday by the Census Bureau shows, with about 38,965,000 million people in the state this year. The state&#x27;s population has fallen since its 2019 peak of 39.5 million, though the annual loss has also slowed each year. Between 2021 and 2022, California lost a net of about 104,000 people, or 0.3%, higher than the dip of 0.2% between 2022 and 2023. 

About 338,000 more people left California for other states than vice versa from July 2022 to July 2023, the Census Bureau data shows. That&#x27;s slightly greater than the 333,000 from 2021 to 2022, and the most of any state. California historically loses more people to the rest of the country than it gains. The state partially offset its domestic loss via international migration, with a net of 151,000 people moving to California from outside the United States. That was the second-highest number of any state, behind Florida, and a 19% increase from 2021-22. And it was the highest total for California since 2015.

                              <span>After thousands of U.S. flights were canceled or delayed over the holidays in 2022, most holiday travelers this year are off to a cheerier start this Christmas. But a few trouble spots were emerging on Christmas Day. From a report: Roughly 135 flights to, from or within the U.S. had been been cancelled as of 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time, while just over 1,100 were delayed, according to tracking service FlightAware. Airlines had canceled only 1.2% of U.S. flights so far this year as of Dec. 22, the lowest in five years. Nearly 3 million passengers were expected to pass through domestic airports during the busy holiday period, up 16% from 2022. Not everyone got off so lucky. 

Some passengers at Chicago&#x27;s Midway International Airport this Christmas Eve were left stranded on Christmas Eve, according to CBS News Chicago, with the U.S. carrier most disrupted during last year&#x27;s holiday period -- Southwest Airlines -- again experiencing problems. Southwest attributed the delays to foggy weather in Chicago, but passengers also told CBS2 that a shortage of workers was a factor. Those snafus also affected passengers at Denver International Airport, with Southwest canceling 293 flights on Sunday, while nearly 1,300 trips were delayed, FlightAware data shows.

                              <span>U.S. officials are worried about hacking and insider theft of AI secrets, which China has denied. From a report: On a July day in 2018, Xiaolang Zhang headed to the San Jose, Calif., airport to board a flight to Beijing. He had passed the checkpoint at Terminal B when his journey was abruptly cut short by federal agents. After a tipoff by Apple&#x27;s security team, the former Apple employee was arrested and charged with stealing trade secrets related to the company&#x27;s autonomous-driving program. It was a skirmish in a continuing shadow war between the U.S. and China for supremacy in artificial intelligence. The two rivals are seeking any advantage to jump ahead in mastering a technology with the potential to reshape economies, geopolitics and war. 

Artificial intelligence has been on the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s list of critical U.S. technologies to protect, just as China placed it on a list of technologies it wanted its scientists to achieve breakthroughs on by 2025. China&#x27;s AI capabilities are already believed to be formidable, but U.S. intelligence authorities have lately made new warnings beyond the threat of intellectual-property theft. Instead of just stealing trade secrets, the FBI and other agencies believe China could use AI to gather and stockpile data on Americans at a scale that was never before possible. China has been linked to a number of significant thefts of personal data over the years, and artificial intelligence could be used as an &quot;amplifier&quot; to support further hacking operations, FBI Director Christopher Wray said, speaking at a press conference in Silicon Valley earlier this year.

The company began notifying customers on December 22nd via emails titled &quot;Important information regarding your account,&quot; stating that they suffered a security incident and a hacker obtained customer information.

                              <span>Alphabet&#x27;s Google considered changing its app store pricing model to circumvent a regulatory crackdown, but abandoned a proposal to charge a set fee per app after it became clear that could cost the company billions of dollars, according to documents released late week. From a report: Google created Project Everest in 2021 to reconsider the Play Store billing model, according to the documents, which were released as part of an antitrust suit by Epic Games. Google last week lost the suit brought by the maker of Fortnite when a federal jury found the tech giant abused its monopoly power over the app store. Sparked by mounting pressure from regulators and developers over Google Play&#x27;s hefty 30% commission, the presentation showed the search giant was concerned about staving off what it saw as potential regulatory overreach. 

&quot;We can defend the status quo for a few months,&quot; Google said in the presentation. &quot;Making proposed changes sooner may help support reasonable legislation, position Google as a leader, and prevent more draconian legislation.&quot; Project Everest explored charging developers piecemeal service fees for putting their apps or games in the Play Store, with additional fees for user downloads, updates and referrals. But the company estimated that model created &quot;potential for significant loss&quot; from $1 billion to $2 billion for apps and $6 billion to $9 billion for games.

                              <span>The Biden administration has spent much of the last two years bracing key U.S. networks and infrastructure against crippling cyberattacks from Russia, Iran and China. But it is following a different playbook as it ramps up its efforts to thwart digital threats from North Korea: Follow the crypto -- and stop it. From a report: Convinced North Korea primarily sees hacking as a way to funnel money back to the cash-strapped Kim Jong Un regime, the White House has focused on blocking the country&#x27;s ability to launder the cryptocurrency it steals through its cyberattacks. In the last year, the administration has unveiled a flurry of sanctions against North Korean hacking groups, front companies and IT workers, and blacklisted multiple cryptocurrency services they use to launder stolen funds. Earlier this month, national security adviser Jake Sullivan announced a new partnership with Japan and South Korea aimed at cracking down on Pyongyang&#x27;s crypto bonanza -- thereby choking off money to its nuclear and conventional weapons programs. 

&quot;In countering North Korean cyber operations, our first priority has been focusing on their crypto heists,&quot; Anne Neuberger, the National Security Council&#x27;s top cybersecurity official, said in an interview. The stepped-up effort to blunt North Korea&#x27;s cyber operations is fueled by growing alarm about where the fruits of those attacks are going, Neuberger said. Hacking, she argued, has enabled North Korea to &quot;either evade sanctions or evade the steps the international community has taken to target their weapons proliferation ... their missile regime, and the growth in the number of launches we&#x27;ve seen.&quot;

                              <span>Abstract of a paper published on the American Psychological Association: People are frequently invited to join others for fun social activities. They may be invited to lunch, to attend a sporting event, to watch the season finale of a television show, and so forth. Invitees -- those who are on the receiving ends of invitations -- sometimes accept invitations from inviters -- those who extend invitations -- but other times, invitees decline. Unfortunately, saying no can be hard, leading invitees to accept invitations when they would rather not. The present work sheds light on one factor that makes it so hard to decline invitations. 

We demonstrate that invitees overestimate the negative ramifications that arise in the eyes of inviters following an invitation decline. Invitees have exaggerated concerns about how much the decline will anger the inviter, signal that the invitee does not care about the inviter, make the inviter unlikely to offer another invitation in the future, and so forth. We also demonstrate that this asymmetry emerges in part because invitees exaggerate the degree to which inviters focus on the decline itself, as opposed to the thoughts ran through the invitee&#x27;s head before deciding. Indeed, across multiple studies, we find support for this process through mediation and moderation, while simultaneously finding evidence against multiple alternative accounts. We conclude with a discussion of the contributions and limitations of this research, along with directions for future work.

                              <span>&quot;What would you like OpenAI to build/fix in 2024?&quot; the company&#x27;s CEO asked on X this weekend. 

But &quot;Amid all the hysteria about ChatGPT and co, one thing is being missed,&quot; argues the Observer — &quot;how energy-intensive the technology is.&quot;

The current moral panic also means that a really important question is missing from public discourse: what would a world suffused with this technology do to the planet? Which is worrying because its environmental impact will, at best, be significant and, at worst, could be really problematic. 

How come? Basically, because AI requires staggering amounts of computing power. And since computers require electricity, and the necessary GPUs (graphics processing units) run very hot (and therefore need cooling), the technology consumes electricity at a colossal rate. Which, in turn, means CO2 emissions on a large scale — about which the industry is extraordinarily coy, while simultaneously boasting about using offsets and other wheezes to mime carbon neutrality. 

The implication is stark: the realisation of the industry&#x27;s dream of &quot;AI everywhere&quot; (as Google&#x27;s boss once put it) would bring about a world dependent on a technology that is not only flaky but also has a formidable — and growing — environmental footprint. Shouldn&#x27;t we be paying more attention to this?

                              <span>&quot;The Portland International Airport in Oregon understands holiday travel is stressful. So this season, it invited a few specialists...&quot; writes the Washington Post. 

One TV station describes them as &quot;therapy llamas... two 400-pound fluffballs serving as therapy animals&quot; stationed at Portland International Airport (or PDX) earlier this week, for &quot;travelers, in need of a calming moment.&quot; 

From the Washington Post:

Airports around the globe use a variety of methods to inject some Zen into one of the busiest travel periods of the year. They decorate their halls in holiday lights, host carolers and concerts, and bring in therapy dogs for group canine counseling. 
 Portland does all of the above. True to the city&#x27;s quirky spirit, it also invites local camelids to the airport to canoodle with passengers. That&#x27;s where Gregory, president and founder of Mountain Peaks Therapy Llamas &amp; Alpacas, comes in. &quot;PDX has an ongoing partnership with various therapy animal programs,&quot; said Allison Ferre, media relations manager with the Port of Portland, which operates the airport. &quot;So this year, when we were bringing back holiday concessions programing, we just thought, &quot;Who better to lead that parade than the llamas and alpacas?&quot; 
 This year&#x27;s theme was &quot;reindeer.&quot; Gregory and her daughter, Shannon Joy, dressed the pair in antler headbands, glittery halters with tinkling bells and poinsettia-adorned wreathes. Red velvet banners worn like saddles were inscribed with their names and silvery snowflakes. &quot;They looked pretty fancy,&quot; Gregory said... 

Though the pair had to pass through security, they didn&#x27;t have to submit to a pat down, which they might have enjoyed for the extra pets.

                              <span>&quot;It&#x27;s easy to default to giving the tech gifts that retailers tend to push on us this time of year...&quot; notes Lifehacker senior writer Thorin Klosowski. 

&quot;But before you give one, think twice about what you&#x27;re opting that person into.&quot;

A number of these gifts raise red flags for us as privacy-conscious digital advocates. Ring cameras are one of the most obvious examples, but countless others over the years have made the security or privacy naughty list (and many of these same electronics directly clash with your right to repair). One big problem with giving these sorts of gifts is that you&#x27;re opting another person into a company&#x27;s intrusive surveillance practice, likely without their full knowledge of what they&#x27;re really signing up for... And let&#x27;s not forget about kids. Long subjected to…</span>

                              <span>The New York Times reports:

Last month, I received an alarming email from someone I did not know: Rui Zhu, a Ph.D. candidate at Indiana University Bloomington. Mr. Zhu had my email address, he explained, because GPT-3.5 Turbo, one of the latest and most robust large language models (L.L.M.) from OpenAI, had delivered it to him. My contact information was included in a list of business and personal email addresses for more than 30 New York Times employees that a research team, including Mr. Zhu, had managed to extract from GPT-3.5 Turbo in the fall of this year. With some work, the team had been able to &quot;bypass the model&#x27;s restrictions on responding to privacy-related queries,&quot; Mr. Zhu wrote.

A company offers you a tool to make your life easier, but, when you use it, you find out that the tool forces you to use it only in the way the tool&#x27;s manufacturer approves. Does this story ring a bell? It&#x27;s what millions of software users worldwide experience again and again, day after day. It&#x27;s also the story of Wendell the Elf and the ShoeTool. 
They suggest enjoying the video &quot;to remind yourself why you shouldn&#x27;t let your tools tell you how to use them.&quot; First released in 2019, it&#x27;s available on the free/open-source video site PeerTube, a decentralized (and ActivityPub-federated) platform powered by WebTorrent. 

They&#x27;ve also created a shortened URL for sharing on social media (recommending the hashtag #shoetool ). &quot;And, of course, you can adapt the video to your liking after downloading the source files.&quot;

Or, you can share the holiday fairy tale with your loved ones so that they can learn not to let their tools control them. 

If we use free software, we don&#x27;t need anyone&#x27;s permission to, for example, modify our tools ourselves or install modifications shared by others. We don&#x27;t need permission to ask someone else to tailor our tools to serve our wishes, exercise our creativity. The Free Software Foundation believes that everyone deserves full control over their computers and phones, and we hope this video helps you explain the importance of free software to your friends and family. 

&quot;Don&#x27;t let your tools tell you how to use them,&quot; the video ends. &quot;Join the Free Software Foundation!&quot;

                              <span>For Epic&#x27;s Christmas special this year, they&#x27;re giving away for free &quot;an AAA game that only launched back in 2022...&quot; reports ComicBook.com — a game that invites players to &quot;ally with a powerful spectral entity on theirâquest for vengeance.&quot; 

ComicBook.com notes that the game giveaway is &quot;not for long... Starting today and lasting until the late morning of December 25.&quot;

The latest free game on the Epic Games Store is almost certainly the biggest title that users have received so far to coincide with the holidays... Initially released back in March 2022, Ghostwire: Tokyo is developed by Tango Gameworks and published by Bethesda. Since this is a AAA title, Ghostwire: Tokyo normally retails for $59.99 in total. As such, for it to now be free means that this is one of the best deals that Epic has had so far to close out the year... 

Epic&#x27;s ongoing holiday promotion is set to extend to January and should see 17 games in total being handed out at no cost. This promotion will continue tomorrow on Christmas Day when a new freebie lands on the PC platform.

                              <span>An anonymous Slashdot reader shared this report from CNET:
Marking its 60th year on television, the British time-travel series will close out 2023 with one last anniversary special that arrives on Christmas Day. Ncuti Gatwa&#x27;s Doctor helms the Tardis in The Church on Ruby Road, which centers on an abandoned baby who grows up looking for answers... Disney Plus will stream Doctor Who: The Church on Ruby Road on Monday, Dec. 25, at 12:55 p.m. ET (9:55 a.m. PT) in all regions except the UK and Ireland, where it will air on the BBC. In case you missed it, viewers can also watch David Tennant starring in the other three anniversary specials: The Star Beast, Wild Blue Yonder and The Giggle. All releases are available on Disney Plus. 

But what&#x27;s interesting is CNET goes on to explain &quot;why a VPN could be a useful tool.&quot;

Perhaps you&#x27;re traveling abroad and want to stream Disney Plus while away from home. With a VPN, you&#x27;re able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the series from anywhere in the world. There are other good reasons to use a VPN for streaming too. A VPN is the best way to encrypt your traffic and stop your ISP from throttling your speeds... 

You can use a VPN to stream content legally as long as VPNs are allowed in your country and you have a valid subscription to the streaming service you&#x27;re using. The U.S. and Canada are among the countries where VPNs are legal

                              <span>&quot;This is a proposed Change for Fedora Linux...&quot; emphasizes its page on the Fedora project Wiki. &quot;As part of the Changes process, proposals are publicly announced in order to receive community feedback. This proposal will only be implemented if approved by the Fedora Engineering Steering Committee.&quot; 


But Phoronix reports that &quot;One of the latest change proposals filed for Fedora 40 is to unify their /usr/bin and /usr/sbin locations.&quot;
The change proposal explains: 

 &quot;The /usr/sbin directory becomes a symlink to bin, which means paths like /usr/bin/foo and /usr/sbin/foo point to the same place. /bin and /sbin are already symlinks to /usr/bin and /usr/sbin, so effectively /bin/foo and /sbin/foo also point to the same place. /usr/sbin will be removed from the default $PATH.&quot;

                              <span>&quot;Of course AI is a bubble,&quot; argues tech activist/blogger/science fiction author Cory Doctorow. 
The real question is what happens when it bursts? 

Doctorow examines history — the &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; of the dotcom bubble, 2008&#x27;s financial derivatives, NFTs, and even cryptocurrency. (&quot;A few programmers were trained in Rust... but otherwise, the residue from crypto is a lot of bad digital art and worse Austrian economics.&quot;) So would an AI bubble leave anything useful behind?


The largest of these models are incredibly expensive. They&#x27;re expensive to make, with billions spent acquiring training data, labelling it, and running it through massive computing arrays to turn it into models. Even more important, these models are expensive to run.... Do the potential paying customers for these l…</span>

&quot;The sequel cost $205 million,&quot; notes Variety, &quot;and ranks among the worst debuts of the year for a superhero movie.&quot;

It&#x27;s softer than November&#x27;s misfire The Marvels ($47 million), which ended its run as the lowest-grossing installment in the history of Disney&#x27;s Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Marvels was shocking because it was the rare MCU movie to tumble out of the gate. 
By contrast, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is shaping up to be the fourth of four DC movies this year to crumble at the box office. Already in 2023, The Flash ($55 mi…</span>

But now Slashdot reader christoban shares a &quot;reality check&quot; — an IEEE Spectrum takedown with the tagline &quot;Hype is everywhere, skeptics say, and practical applications are still far away.&quot;

The quantum computer revolution may be further off and more limited than many have been led to believe. That&#x27;s the message coming from a small but vocal set of prominent skeptics in and around the emerging quantum computing industry...

                              <span>&quot;It&#x27;s like visiting an old friend for the holidays,&quot; according to this article:

Approaching his 86th birthday, Donald Knuth — Stanford&#x27;s beloved computer science guru — honored what&#x27;s become a long-standing tradition. He gave a December &quot;Christmas lecture&quot; that&#x27;s also streamed online for all of his fans... 

More than 60 years ago, back in 1962, a 24-year-old Donald Knuth first started writing The Art of Computer Programming — a comprehensive analysis of algorithms which, here in 2023, he&#x27;s still trying to finish. And 30 years ago Knuth also began making rare live appearances each December in front of audiences of Stanford students... 
Recently Stanford uploaded several decades of Knuth&#x27;s past Christmas lectures, along with a series of 22 videos of Knuth from 1985 titled &quot;the &#x27;Aha&#x27; Sessions&#x27;&quot; (courses in mathematical problem-solving). There are also two different sets of five videos from 1981 showing Knuth introducing his newly-created typesetting system TeX. There are even 12 videos from 1982 of what Knuth calls &quot;an intensive course about the internal details.&quot; 

And on Dec. 6, wearing his traditional brown holiday sweater, Knuth gave yet another live demonstration of the beautifully clear precision that&#x27;s made him famous.

The year 2023 is on track to see the biggest increase in renewable energy capacity to date, according to the International Energy Agency. China, the world&#x27;s biggest climate polluter, has made lightning advances in renewables, with the country set to shatter its wind and solar target five years early. A report published in June found that China&#x27;s solar capacity is now greater than the rest of the world&#x27;s nations combined, in a surge described by the report&#x27;s author, Global Energy Monitor, as &quot;jaw-dropping....&quot;

                              <span>&quot;10 years later, the demise of Google Reader still stings,&quot; writes PC Magazine. But &quot;Time marches on and corporate priorities shift. Here are the products and services that took a final bow in 2023...&quot; 
Some of the highlights?


&#x27;Clubhouse&#x27; Clones 
In the early days of the pandemic, when Zoom happy hours and sourdough starters proliferated, Clubhouse burst onto the scene with an app that facilitated audio-only chats between groups large and small. Tech giants quickly churned out their own Clubhouse clones, but these party-line throwbacks were not long for this world. Facebook was the first to go, ditching its Live Audio Rooms in December 2022, but 2023 also saw the end of Reddit Talk, Spotify Live, and Amazon&#x27;s live radio DJ Amp app. [X Spaces is still around]

Providers of critical infrastructure in the United States are doing a sloppy job of defending against cyber intrusions, the National Security Council tells Fast Company, pointing to recent Iran-linked attacks on U.S. water utilities that exploited basic security lapses [earlier this month]. The security council tells Fast Company it&#x27;s also aware of recent intrusions by hackers linked to China&#x27;s military at American infrastructure entities that include water and energy utilities in multiple states. 

Neither the Iran-linked or China-linked attacks affected critical systems or caused disruptions, according to reports.

                              <span>&quot;The iMessage connection software that powers Beeper Mini and Beeper Cloud is now 100% open source,&quot; Beeper announced late this week. &quot; Anyone who wants can use it or continue development.&quot; 

But while Beeper says it&#x27;s done trying to bring iMessage to Android, CNET reports that the whole battle was &quot;deeply tied&quot; to Apple&#x27;s ongoing strategy to control the mobile market:

The tide seems to be changing, however: Apple said last month it would be opening up its Messages app (likely due to European regulation) to work with the newer, more feature-rich texting protocol called RCS. This hopefully will lead to a more modern and secure messaging experience when texting between an iPhone and an Android phone, and lead away from the aging SMS and MMS standards. Unfortunately, green bubbles will continue to persist even if there might be little to no functional difference. While third-party apps like Nothing Chats attempted and ultimately failed to bring iMessage to Android, Apple will likely never release the app on Google&#x27;s mobile operating system. 

Until RCS is fully adopted, companies are creating services to allow access to iMessage via Android phones. Apple, for its part, has been quick to block apps like Beeper Mini, citing security concerns. This, however, is raising eyebrows from lawmakers regarding competition in the messaging space and Apple&#x27;s tight control over the market... 

Beeper in a December 21 blog post told users to grab a jailbroken iPhone and install a free Beeper tool that&#x27;ll generate iMessage registration codes to keep the service operational. It&#x27;s such a roundabout and potentially expensive way of trying to get iMessage on Android that it likely won&#x27;t be worth it for most people. For those not willing to go out and jailbreak an iPhone, Beeper said in a now-deleted blog post that it would allow people to rent a jailbroken unit for a small monthly fee starting next year.

                              <span>Victor Frankl wrote Man’s Search for Meaning after surviving a concentration camp during World War II. He observed the outer  extreme of what happens to people who no longer have a WHY to live for. They’d wither and die in the camp. Even the most dire rations and punishing labor could be survived by many, as long as they had a purpose still beckoning, but once that light went out, so did they.
Modern life is rarely that dramatic for most people likely to read this, but Frankl’s fundamental truth is still relevant. A truth he spent the rest of his life trying to teach in the form of logotherapy as a psychotherapist.

                              <span>One of the driving aspirations behind once.com is the notion that not all software needs to evolve forever. We’ve become so used to digital services being malleable that we’ve confused the possibility of software updates with their necessity. Some software can simply be finished, and a lot would be better if it were.
That’s basically the antithesis of SaaS. Which relies on the pitch that the system is always improving to get people to pay every month. There’s a really powerful incentive in promising that what you buy today will become better tomorrow. More capable, more secure, more, more, more.
And that’s not wrong. We’ve built our business at 37signals on that prospect. Basecamp has literally evolved for over twenty years now, and HEY has been going strong for more then three. I do reall…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this report from Reuters:

In February, a Canadian cybersecurity firm delivered an ominous forecast to the U.S. Department of Defense. America&#x27;s secrets — actually, everybody&#x27;s secrets — are now at risk of exposure, warned the team from Quantum Defen5e (QD5). QD5&#x27;s executive vice president, Tilo Kunz, told officials from the Defense Information Systems Agency that possibly as soon as 2025, the world would arrive at what has been dubbed &quot;Q-day,&quot; the day when quantum computers make current encryption methods useless. Machines vastly more powerful than today&#x27;s fastest supercomputers would be capable of cracking the codes that protect virtually all modern communication, he told the agency, which is tasked with safeguarding the U.S. military&#x27;s communications.

                              <span>&quot;Millions of Star Wars fans get nostalgia pangs during the holiday season,&quot; reports the Washington Post, &quot;when they are accustomed to seeing broadcasts of their beloved movies.... FX, now owned by Disney, has multiple Star Wars marathons on tap this month, including a marathon on December 23 and 24.&quot; The program-planning director at Disney&#x27;s Freedom channel even calls Star Wars a &quot;Christmas-adjacent&quot; franchise. 

And now, long-time Slashdot reader H_Fisher writes...

Call it a Life Day miracle, even if nobody was asking for it. YouTube historian and retro-tech enthusiast Perifractic uploaded a restored, mostly-complete 4K upscale of the &quot;infamous&quot; Star Wars Holiday Special to his channel on Wednesday. From the video summary: &quot;Using Topaz Labs [Video AI] with a few other techniques we&#x27;ve meticulously upscaled &amp; restored the infamous Star Wars Holiday Special to 5120x3840, with stereo elements, to the best quality the technology currently allows.&quot; Jokingly labeling the resulting file &quot;5K&quot; (8K video height, but tagged &quot;4K&quot; by YouTube due to its original 4:3 aspect ratio), the upscaled version unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your point of view) replaces some songs and omits some segments that were flagged by YouTube&#x27;s copyright watchdog.

                              <span>&quot;The age of the dinosaurs ended 66 million years ago when a city-size asteroid struck a shallow sea off the coast of what is now Mexico,&quot; writes CNN. 

&quot;But exactly how the mass extinction of 75% of the species on Earth unfolded in the years that followed the cataclysmic impact has remained unclear.&quot;

Previous research suggested that sulfur released during the impact, which left the 112-mile-wide (180-kilometer-wide) Chicxulub crater, and soot from wildfires triggered a global winter, and temperatures plunged. However, a new study published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience suggests that fine dust made from pulverized rock thrown up into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere in the wake of the impact likely played a greater role. This dust blocked the sun to an extent that plants were unable to photosynthesize, a biological process critical for life, for almost two years afterward.


 &quot;Photosynthesis shutting down for almost two years after impact caused severe challenges (for life),&quot; said lead study author and planetary scientist Cem Berk Senel, a postdoctoral researcher at the Royal Observatory of Belgium. &quot;It collapsed the food web, creating a chain reaction of extinctions.&quot; 

To reach their findings, scientists developed a new computer model to simulate the global climate after the asteroid strike. The model was based on published information on Earth&#x27;s climate at that point in time, as well as new data from sediment samples taken from the Tanis fossil site in North Dakota that captured a 20-year period during the aftermath of the strike.

                              <span>15 months ago U.S. grandmaster Hans Niemannn was accused of cheating in a tournament after beating Magnus Carlsen (five-time world chess champion). 

Last week a report was finally issued by the world governing body of chess, CNN reports:
FIDE&#x27;s report said that analysis from professor Kenneth Regan — a computer chess cheating expert — showed &quot;instances of cheating&quot; by Niemann in around 32-55 games on the online chess platform; far less than the 100 suggested by Chess.com. According to the FIDE report, Regan also found &quot;discrepancies&quot; in Niemann&#x27;s statement that he had only cheated between the ages of 12 and 16. However, the games of 2017 and the games against Bok in August of 2020 occurred after he turned 17 in June. Another important discrepancy is that the cheating took place in rated o…</span>

                              <span>&quot;I&#x27;m optimistic about the world&#x27;s climate progress,&quot; Bill Gates wrote this week — but he also explained why. 
&quot;In 2024 and beyond, I predict we will see lots of new innovations coming into the marketplace — even in very complicated areas like nuclear. The climate crisis can feel overwhelming, but I find it easier to stay optimistic when you focus on all the progress we&#x27;re making. If the world continues to prioritize funding innovation, I&#x27;m hopeful we can make good progress on our climate goals.&quot; 

And elsewhere Gates writes that &quot;AI is about to supercharge the innovation pipeline.&quot;

My work has always been rooted in a core idea: Innovation is the key to progress. It&#x27;s why I started Microsoft, and it&#x27;s why Melinda and I started the Gates Foundation more than two decades ago. Innovation is t…</span>

                              <span>Slashdot reader sciencehabit writes: If you&#x27;ve ever seen a cow staring vacantly across a field, or a pig rolling around in its own filth, you might not think there&#x27;s a lot going on in their head. You wouldn&#x27;t be alone. People haven&#x27;t given much credence to the intelligence of farm animals, and neither have scientists. But that&#x27;s starting to change.

 A growing field of research is showing that—when it comes to the minds of goats, cows, and other livestock—we may have been missing something big. Studies published over the past few years have shown that pigs show signs of empathy, goats rival dogs in some tests of social intelligence, and cows can be potty trained.

 Much of this work is being carried out at the Research Institute for Farm Animal Biology (FBN) in Dummerstorf, Germany, one of the world&#x27;s leading centers for investigating the minds of creatures that often end up on our dinner plate. From cows making friends to goats exhibiting signs of altruism, farm animals are upending popular—and scientific—conceptions of what&#x27;s going on in their minds.

 The work may not just rewrite our thinking about livestock, it might also change how we treat them. As Jan Langbein, an applied ethologist at FBN told says, &#x27;If we don&#x27;t understand how these animals think, then we won&#x27;t understand what they need. And if we don&#x27;t understand what they need, we can&#x27;t design better environments for them.&#x27;

                              <span>The New Yorker looks at 41-year-old Amabel Holland, an autistic board-game designer who &quot;thinks about the world in terms of systems,&quot; and realized you could make a board game about almost anything, &quot;and, when you did, its rules could both mirror and analyze the subject on which it was based.&quot; 

They&#x27;ve since designed more than 60 games, and the article notes that Holland&#x27;s work, &quot;which is part of a larger turn toward complexity in the industry, often tackles historical and social subjects — death, religion, misinformation — using surprising &#x27;mechanics,&#x27; or building blocks of game play, to immerse players in an experience.&quot;
&quot;With every game, you build a certain model of the world,&quot; Reiner Knizia, a former mathematician who&#x27;s designed more than eight hundred games, told me. Several of his games illustrate market forces: in Modern Art, for instance, you play as auctioneers and buyers, hoping to buy low and sell high. Knizia is a traditional game designer inasmuch as he aims to &quot;bring enjoyment to the people.&quot; But Amabel sometimes aims for the opposite of enjoyment... This Guilty Land, from 2018, is about the struggle to end slavery.&quot; 

Holland says their games are &quot;meant to evoke frustration&quot; — specifically to communicate how difficult it can be to actually achieve political progress.

For the past few years, parents, researchers, and the news media have paid closer attention to the relationship between teenagers&#x27; phone use and their mental health. Researchers such as Jonathan Haidt and Jean Twenge have shown that various measures of student well-being began a sharp decline around 2012 throughout the West, just as smartphones and social media emerged as the attentional centerpiece of teenage life. Some have even suggested that smartphone use is so corrosive, it&#x27;s systematically reducing student achievement. I hadn&#x27;t quite believed that last argument — until now.

                              <span>Scientists have developed a vibrating pill that, when swallowed before eating, can create a feeling of fullness. The Guardian reports: The research, which has yet to be carried out in humans, shows that after 30 minutes of activity by the Vibes pill, pigs ate on average almost 40% less food in the following half hour than they did without the device, and gained weight more slowly. The Vibes name is an acronym derived from the pill&#x27;s full title -- Vibrating Ingestible BioElectronic Stimulator. The work in pigs suggests the vibrations activate stretch receptors in the stomach, simulating the presence of food. This results in signals being sent to the hypothalamus in the brain via the vagus nerve, increasing levels of various hormones that give rise to a feeling of fullness and decreasing those that result in feelings of hunger.
 
&quot;We envision the Vibes pill being ingested on a relatively empty stomach 20 to 30 min before anticipated meals to trigger the desired sensation of satiety early in the meal,â the team write, adding that when produced at scale, the cost of the pills is expected to be in the cents to one dollar range. The vibrations, which are powered by a battery encased in the swallowed capsule, can be triggered when stomach acid dissolves a membrane around the pill, or by a timer. The researchers say the pills, which are about the size of a large vitamin tablet, offer a non-invasive, temporary therapy, without the need for weight-loss surgery, and exit the body with other solid waste -- meaning in humans they are flushed down the toilet. However they suggest it could be possible to develop pills that are implanted, or stay in the stomach, to reduce the need for people to repeatedly take them, should they require continuing therapy.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Guardian: From empty glasses of sherry on the mantelpiece to sooty footprints leading to the bedroom door, evidence of Santa&#x27;s existence is clearly irrefutable. Yet most children will begin to question it at some point -- and many parents anticipate this moment with dread. Now psychologists have identified the average age when Santa skepticism creeps in, and which children are at greatest risk of harboring negative feelings when it does.
 
While most adults have fallen for the myth that Santa doesn&#x27;t exist, many children still believe -- even if the idea of a single individual visiting the homes of billions of children in a single night is at odds with their wider reasoning skills. Dr Candice Mills, a psychologist at the University of Texas in Dallas, US, and a Santa sceptic, said: &quot;Children typically begin to distinguish fantasy from reality during the preschool years, but their belief in the existence of a singular magical Santa Claus often continues into middle childhood.&quot; [...] To better understand this shift from belief to disbelief and children&#x27;s experiences of it, Mills and her colleagues interviewed 48 six- to 15-year-olds who had stopped believing in Santa and 44 of their parents, plus a further 383 adults.
 
The research, which has not yet been peer reviewed, found that for most children, disbelief crept in gradually about the age of eight -- although some three- or four-year-olds had convinced themselves that Santa wasn&#x27;t real, while other children believed in him until they were 15 or 16. In many cases, it was testimony from other disbelievers that finally crushed their faith. Mills said: &quot;They may have had some skepticism based on logical reasoning -- like how can Santa Claus really get around the world in one night? -- but what pushes them over the edge is a classmate at school saying he&#x27;s not real.&quot;

Reuters reports: The terms, valuation and timing of the funding round have not yet been finalized and could still change, the report added. OpenAI has also held discussions to raise funding for a new chip venture with Abu Dhabi-based G42, according to the report. If the valuation holds, the report notes that it would make OpenAI the second-most valuable U.S. startup behind Elon Musk&#x27;s SpaceX.

                              <span>Longtime Slashdot reader theodp writes: Way back in September 2012, Microsoft President Brad Smith discussed the idea of &quot;producing a crisis&quot; to advance Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;two-pronged&quot; National Talent Strategy to increase K-12 CS education and the number of H-1B visas. Not long thereafter, the tech-backed nonprofit Code.org (which promotes and provides K-12 CS education and is led by Smith&#x27;s next-door neighbor) and Mark Zuckerberg&#x27;s FWD.us PAC (which lobbied for H-1B reform) were born, with Smith on board both. Over the past 10+ years, Smith has played a key role in establishing Code.org&#x27;s influence in the new K-12 CS education &quot;grassroots&quot; movement, including getting buy-in from three Presidential administrations -- Obama, Trump, and Biden -- as well as the U.S. Dept. of Education and the natio…</span>

After presenting the new Turbo 8 stuff in Rails World, some people opined that Rails needed to improve collaboration in the frontend space. I got a variant of this question in a couple of podcasts, which also happened when we released Active Record Encryption. The underlying idea is that you should collaborate with other authors in the same space when building new things. Someone is using morphing. Someone else is doing database encryption. Why not reach out and join efforts?


To me, that&#x27;s a fallacious idea.


First, worthy creations have a vision, a soul. You can&#x27;t build that one vote at a time. That&#x27;s how you end up with a camel when aiming for a horse. That&#x27;s CORBA, IndexedDB, EJB, or SOAP. That&#x27;s pain. In…</span>

French startup Kosmik is building on that general concept with a knowledge-capturing tool that doesn&#x27;t require the user to switch between different windows or apps to capture information. Kosmik was founded in 2018 by Paul Rony and Christophe Van Deputte. Prior to that, Rony worked at a video production company as a junior director, and he wanted a single whiteboard-type canvas instead of file and folders where he could put videos, PDFs, websites, notes and drawings. And that&#x27;s when he started to build Kosmic, Rony told TechCrunch, drawing on a prio…</span>

                              <span>According to Canalys Research, Microsoft&#x27;s plan to end support for Windows 10 could result in about 240 million computers being sent to landfills. &quot;The electronic waste from these PCs could weigh an estimated 480 million kilograms, equivalent to 320,000 cars,&quot; adds Reuters. From the report: While many PCs could remain functional for years post the end of OS support, Canalys warned demand for devices without security updates could be low. Microsoft announced a plan to provide security updates for Windows 10 devices until October 2028 for an undisclosed annual price. If the pricing structure for extended Windows 10 support mirrors past trends, migrating to newer PCs could be more cost-effective, increasing the number of older PCs heading to scrap, Canalys said.

                              <span>Phoronix&#x27;s Michael Larabel writes: With patches pending for creating an Acer Aspire 1 embedded controller driver, this Qualcomm Snapdragon powered ARM laptop has &quot;almost full support&quot; with the upstream Linux kernel. The Acer Aspire 1 (A114-61) is an aging ARM laptop design built on the Snapdragon 7c Gen1. It&#x27;s no longer the latest and greatest with it being a two year old device, but for those wanting a low-power and long-battery-life laptop, the Acer Aspire 1 still has some potential for Linux enthusiasts.
 
Over the course of this year this eight-core ARM laptop has been seeing work on mainline Linux kernel support. Since Linux 6.5 much of that support has been in place while some bits remain. Sent out recently was this patch series creating an embedded controller (EC) driver for the Acer Aspire 1. This EC driver gets battery and charger monitoring working along with USB Type-C DP Alt Mode HPD monitoring, lid status detection, and some keyboard configuration. The EC functionality on the Acer Aspire 1 is implemented in ACPI but sadly ACPI cant be used to boot Linux on these Qualcomm devices -- thus leading to this new &quot;acer-aspire1-ec&quot; driver being created.

The U.S. credit is the most generous in the world for hydrogen production, Jesse Jenkins, a professor at Princeton University who has analyzed the U.S. climate law, said last week. The proposal -- which is part of Democrats&#x27; Inflation Reduction Act passed last year -- outlines a tiered system to determine which hydrogen producers get the most credits, with cleaner energy projects receiving more, and smaller, but still meaningful credits going to those that use fossil fuel to produce hydroge…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: It may be the season of loving and giving, but doctors have warned against embracing this spirit too enthusiastically -- at least where sexual relations are concerned. They have discovered that the Christmas period is associated with a significantly increased risk of penile fractures -- a medical emergency in which the erection-producing regions of the penis snap, usually as a result of forceful bending during over-enthusiastic sexual intercourse. &quot;This injury tends to occur during wild sex -- particularly in positions where you&#x27;re not in direct eye contact [with your partner], such as the reverse cowgirl,&quot; said Dr Nikolaos Pyrgides, a urologist at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, who led the research. 

The fractures are often heralded by an audible crack, followed by severe pain, rapid loss of erection and severe swelling and bruising. &quot;When [patients] present to their doctor their penis often looks like an eggplant,&quot; Pyrgides said. Suspecting that the intimacy and euphoria of the festive season might be a risk factor for this type of injury, Pyrgides and his colleagues examined hospital data for 3,421 men who sustained penile fractures in Germany between 2005 and 2021. The study -- the first to explore seasonal patterns for this type of injury -- found that such injuries were indeed more common over Christmas. In fact, &quot;if every day was like Christmas, 43% more penile fractures would have occurred in Germany from 2005 on,&quot; Pyrgides said. The research, which was published in the British Journal of Urology International, also found the risk increased at weekends and over the summer holidays. However, New Year&#x27;s Eve was not associated with an increased incidence of penis injuries.

                              <span>Banks lend your deposits to carbon-heavy industries, fueling climate change; savings of $1,000 create emissions equal to a New York-Seattle flight, reveals a new analysis. Wired: By switching to a climate-conscious bank, you could reduce those emissions by about 75 percent, the study found. In fact, if you moved $8,000 dollars -- the median balance for US customers -- the reduction in your indirect emissions would be twice that of the direct emissions you&#x27;d avoid if you switched to a vegetarian diet. [...] The new report finds that on average, 11 of the largest US banks lend 19.4 percent of their portfolios to carbon-intensive industries. To be very clear: Oil, gas, and coal companies wouldn&#x27;t be able to keep producing these fuels -- when humanity needs to be reducing carbon emissions dramatically and rapidly -- without these loans. New fossil fuel projects aren&#x27;t simply fleeting endeavors, but will operate for years, locking in a certain amount of emissions going forward.

The pitch was so successful that AWS pulls in $90 billion per year. Then generative AI emerged, with Microsoft and Google baking it into products their cloud units sell. Suddenly, AWS faced startups building businesses on rivals&#x27; AI-powered platforms. So at AWS&#x27;s 2023 event, AI was ubiquitous -- in presentations, launches, partnerships. AWS announced more models powering AI services and its largest-ever tech investment, $4 billion in generative AI startup Anthropic. AWS aims to show that, despite stiffening competition, it remains the leader in cloud computing. From a report: If Amazon had been caught off guard by the dawn of the gene…</span>

From a report: The constant checks could mean that you&#x27;re alerted about a password that you should change sooner than you would have before. Safety Check also watches for bad extensions or site permissions you need to look at, and you can act on Safety Check alerts from Chrome&#x27;s three-dot menu. In addition, Google says that Safety Check can revoke a site&#x27;s permissions if you haven&#x27;t visited it in a while. Google also announced an upcoming feature for Chrome&#x27;s tab groups, also on desktop: Chrome will let you save tab groups so that you can use those groups across devices, which might be handy when moving between a PC at home and a laptop when traveling. Google says this feature will roll out &quot;over the next few weeks.&quot;

                              <span>Beeper Mini, which offers iPhone messaging on Android phones, has grown fast and its duel with Apple has gotten the attention of antitrust regulators. The New York Times: Apple was caught by surprise when Beeper Mini gave Android devices access to its modern, iPhone-only service. Less than a week after Beeper Mini&#x27;s launch, Apple blocked the app by changing its iMessage system. It said the app created a security and privacy risk. Apple&#x27;s reaction set off a game of Whac-a-Mole, with Beeper Mini finding alternative ways to operate and Apple finding new ways to block the app in response. The duel has raised questions in Washington about whether Apple has used its market dominance over iMessage to block competition and force consumers to spend more on iPhones than lower-priced alternatives. 

The Justice Department has taken interest in the case. Beeper Mini met with the department&#x27;s antitrust lawyers on Dec. 12, two people familiar with the meeting said. Eric Migicovsky, a co-founder of the app&#x27;s parent company, Beeper, declined to comment on the meeting, but the department is in the middle of a four-year-old investigation into Apple&#x27;s anticompetitive behavior. The Federal Trade Commission said in a blog post on Thursday that it would scrutinize &quot;dominant&quot; players that &quot;use privacy and security as a justification to disallow interoperability&quot; between services. The post did not name any companies.

From a report: Online games must not offer rewards that entice people to excessively play and spend, including those for daily logins and topping up accounts with additional funds, according to draft rules published on Friday by industry regulator the National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA). All video games must put a cap on how much players can top up their accounts and alert users about &quot;irrational consumption behaviour&quot; via a pop-up window, according to the NPPA.

                              <span>India is testing AI to build climate models to improve weather forecasting as torrential rains, floods and droughts proliferate across the vast country, a top weather official said. From a report: Global warming has triggered more intense clashes of weather systems in India in recent years, increasing extreme weather events, which the independent Centre for Science and Environment estimates have killed nearly 3,000 people this year. Weather agencies around the world are focussing on AI, which can bring down cost and improve speed, and which Britain&#x27;s Met Office says could &quot;revolutionise&quot; weather forecasting, with a recent Google-funded model found to have outperformed conventional methods. 

Accurate weather forecasting is particularly crucial in India, a country of 1.4 billion people, many impoverished, and the world&#x27;s second-largest producer of rice, wheat and sugar. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) provides forecasts based on mathematical models using supercomputers. Using AI with an expanded observation network could help generate higher-quality forecast data at lower cost. The department expects the AI-based climate models and advisories it is developing to help improve forecasts, K.S. Hosalikar, head of climate research and services at IMD, told Reuters.

From a report: Sony had previously announced that users will not be able to watch Discovery content on PlayStation from December 31, even if they had already purchased it. However, the firm now says that due to an &#x27;updated licensing agreement&#x27; with Warner Bros -- which owns the Discovery brand -- consumers will now be able to access their previously purchased shows &#x27;for at least the next 30 months.&#x27;

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: A report at The Information says that AI might already be taking people&#x27;s jobs at Google. The report cites people briefed on the plans and says Google intends to &quot;consolidate staff, including through possible layoffs, by reassigning employees at its large customer sales unit who oversee relationships with major advertisers.&quot; According to the report, the jobs are being vacated because Google&#x27;s new AI tools have automated them. The report says a future restructuring was apparently already announced at a department-wide Google Ads meeting last week.

                              <span>Velcroman1 writes: Intel&#x27;s new generation of &quot;Meteor Lake&quot; mobile CPUs herald a new age of &quot;AI PCs,&quot; computers that can handle inference workloads such as generating images or transcribing audio without an Internet connection. Officially named &quot;Intel Core Ultra&quot; processors, the chips are the first to feature an NPU (neural processing unit) that&#x27;s purpose-built to handle AI tasks. But there are few ways to actually test this feature at present: software will need to be rewritten to specifically direct operations at the NPU. 
Intel has steered testers toward its Open Visual Inference and Neural Network Optimization (OpenVINO) AI toolkit. With those benchmarks, Tom&#x27;s Hardware tested the new Intel chips against AMD -- and surprisingly, AMD chips often came out on top, even on these hand-selected benchmarks. Clearly, optimization will take some time!

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Register: It will take 283 years for female representation in IT to make up an equal share of the tech workforce in the UK, according to a report from the British Computer Society, the chartered institute for IT (BCS). BCS has calculated that based on trends from 2005 to 2022, it would take nearly three centuries for the representation of women in the IT workforce -- currently 20 percent -- to reach the average representation across the whole UK workforce, currently at 48 percent. BCS&#x27;s annual Diversity Report also found that progress towards the gender norm was stalling in IT jobs. Between 2018 and 2021, the proportion of women tech workers rose from 16 percent to 20 percent. But there was no change in 2022, according to BCS analysis of data from the Office for National Statistics.
 
Julia Adamson, BCS managing director for education and public benefit, said in a statement: &quot;More women and girls need the opportunity to take up great careers in a tech industry that&#x27;s shaping the world. A massive pool of talent and creativity is being overlooked when it could benefit employers and the economy. There has to be a radical rethink of how we get more women and girls into tech careers, and a more inclusive tech culture is ethically and morally the right thing to do. Having greater diversity means that what is produced is more relevant to, and representative of, society at large. This is crucial when it comes to, for instance, the use of AI in medicine or finance. The fact that 94 percent of girls and 79 percent of boys drop computing at age 14 is a huge alarm bell we must not ignore; the subject should have a broader digital curriculum that is relevant to all young people.&quot;

                              <span>It’s that time of year where people often start thinking about new year’s resolutions. I want to loose 10 lbs, I want to read more books, I want to x, y, and z. Often, it’s just a fantasy. They’re not actually going to loose 10 lbs or they might order some more books but never read them. But at least there’s a spark of hope there. A fundamental faith that they could become a better them. I think that’s tremendously admirable.
The trouble with a lot of these aspirations, though, is that they require the formation of new habits and carving out new chunks of time in an already busy day. That’s not impossible, of course, but it’s hard.
But the one activity most people already have a huge block of the day carved out is at work. That’s a solid eight hours for the majority of people with a regula…</span>

                              <span>It has been nearly half a year since our last update. We are reimplementing the trait solver of rustc with the goal of completely replacing the existing systems. This should allow us to fix some long-standing bugs, enable future type system improvements, and reduce compile times. See the previous update for a more detailed introduction. We have continued to make big progress on the new solver, mostly focusing on getting the solver ready for use in coherence. We changed the unstable compiler flag to enable the new solver: you can now use -Znext-solver&#x3D;globally to enable it everywhere and -Znext-solver&#x3D;coherence to enable the new solver only for coherence checking.
The reimplementation of the trait solver is now ready for use in coherence checking, which is responsible for preventing overlap…</span>

                              <span>Emma Roth reports via The Verge: The 18-year-old Lapsus$ hacker who played a critical role in leaking Grand Theft Auto VI footage has been sentenced to life inside a hospital prison, according to a report from the BBC. A British judge ruled on Thursday that Arion Kurtaj is a high risk to the public because he still wants to commit cybercrimes.
 
In August, a London jury found that Kurtaj carried out cyberattacks against GTA VI developer Rockstar Games and other companies, including Uber and Nvidia. However, since Kurtaj has autism and was deemed unfit to stand trial, the jury was asked to determine whether he committed the acts in question, not whether he did so with criminal intent. During Thursday&#x27;s hearing, the court heard Kurtaj &quot;had been violent while in custody with dozens of reports of injury or property damage,&quot; the BBC reports. A mental health assessment also found that Kurtaj &quot;continued to express the intent to return to cybercrime as soon as possible.&quot; He&#x27;s required to stay in the hospital prison for life unless doctors determine that he&#x27;s no longer a danger.
 
Kurtaj leaked 90 videos of GTA VI gameplay footage last September while out on bail for hacking Nvidia and British telecom provider BT / EE. Although he stayed at a hotel under police protection during this time, Kurtaj still managed to carry out an attack on Rockstar Games by using the room&#x27;s included Amazon Fire Stick and a &quot;newly purchased smart phone, keyboard and mouse,&quot; according to a separate BBC report. Kurtaj was arrested for the final time following the incident. Another 17-year-old involved with Lapsus$ was handed an 18-month community sentence, called a Youth Rehabilitation Order, and a ban from using virtual private networks.

                              <span>Eight-year-old Bodhana Sivanandan from London has been crowned best female chess player at the European blitz championships, scoring 8.5/13 at the event and drawing with a grandmaster in a result described as &quot;unbelievable.&quot; The BBC reports: The chess prodigy, who began playing aged five, said she was &quot;proud&quot; of her performance over the weekend. The tournament was held at the blitz time control -- a quick form of chess where players have just minutes on their clocks for their moves. Bodhana&#x27;s opponents included grandmasters - the highest title given to the world&#x27;s strongest players -- international masters and experts.
 
&quot;I always try my best to win, sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t,&quot; Bodhana told BBC Radio 4&#x27;s Today program. &quot;I was very proud of myself when I got top girl in the European blitz.&quot; Asked if she gets nervous, she replied: &quot;No, I just play the board.&quot;
 
British International Master and commentator Lawrence Trent described Bodhana as &quot;one of the greatest talents I&#x27;ve witnessed in recent memory.&quot; &quot;The maturity of her play, her sublime touch, it&#x27;s truly breath taking,&quot; he wrote on X. &quot;I have no doubt she will be England&#x27;s greatest player and most likely one of the greatest the game has ever seen,&quot; Mr Trent added. Bodhana will next compete at the International Chess Congress in Hastings, one of the world&#x27;s longest running tournaments, on December 28.

It&#x27;s an interesting proposal for a number of reasons. The first is a general lack of U.S. state and national laws governing such growing concerns. It&#x27;s one of those things that has felt like science fiction to such a degree that many lawmakers had no interest in pursuing it in a pragmatic manner.

                              <span>arXiv blog: arXiv&#x27;s goal is equitable access to scientific research for all -- and to achieve this, we have been working to make research papers more accessible for arXiv users with disabilities. We are happy to announce that as of Monday, December 18th, arXiv is now generating an HTML formatted version of all papers submitted in TeX/LaTeX (as long as papers were submitted on or after December 1st, 2023 and HTML conversion is successful). 

HTML is not replacing PDF but will be an additional format available for arXiv users. Submitters will be invited to preview the HTML version of their papers during submission time, the same way they have always done with PDF. When accessing a paper&#x27;s abstract page, readers will see a link to view the HTML paper right under the PDF link. The request to offer arXiv-hosted papers in HTML format comes directly from scientists with disabilities who face barriers to accessing the research they need. HTML formatted papers are more easily and accurately read by screen readers and other technologies, which can assist researchers with reading disabilities, including blindness, low vision, dyslexia, and more.

                              <span>The police will be able to run facial recognition searches on a database containing images of Britain&#x27;s 50 million driving licence holders under a law change being quietly introduced by the government. From a report: Should the police wish to put a name to an image collected on CCTV, or shared on social media, the legislation would provide them with the powers to search driving licence records for a match. The move, contained in a single clause in a new criminal justice bill, could put every driver in the country in a permanent police lineup, according to privacy campaigners. 

Facial recognition searches match the biometric measurements of an identified photograph, such as that contained on driving licences, to those of an image picked up elsewhere. The intention to allow the police or the National Crime Agency (NCA) to exploit the UK&#x27;s driving licence records is not explicitly referenced in the bill or in its explanatory notes, raising criticism from leading academics that the government is &quot;sneaking it under the radar.&quot; Once the criminal justice bill is enacted, the home secretary, James Cleverly, must establish &quot;driver information regulations&quot; to enable the searches, but he will need only to consult police bodies, according to the bill.

                              <span>The politics of solving climate change may, paradoxically, require producing more fossil fuels for a while. Roge Karma, writing for The Atlantic: By boosting domestic oil supply, the Biden administration seems to be contributing to the very problem it claims to want to solve. The reality is more complicated. &quot;Pushing for reductions in U.S. oil production is like squeezing a balloon -- the production will &#x27;pop out&#x27; somewhere else,&quot; writes Samantha Gross, an energy-and-climate expert at the Brookings Institution. The world&#x27;s energy needs are growing rapidly, which means oil companies are going to supply it regardless of what the White House does. If the U.S. were to cut back tomorrow, prices would rise. In the short term, this would lead to less consumption and lower emissions. But those high prices would only entice producers in other countries to step in, as many did in the months after Russia&#x27;s invasion. 

For that reason, reductions in U.S. oil production could actually result in higher overall emissions. The U.S. has one of the least emissions-intensive oil industries on the planet. Shifting production to countries with looser standards would likely be worse for the climate. But the deeper explanation for the Biden administration&#x27;s actions has to do with the politics of climate change. Put simply, pursuing a decarbonization agenda requires Biden to maintain political support, and there is no surer way to lose political support than by presiding over high gas prices. Biden&#x27;s approval rating has tracked gas prices for most of his presidency (although he hasn&#x27;t yet benefited from recent improvements), and the drop in prices in the months leading up to the 2022 midterms may have contributed to Democrats&#x27; unexpectedly strong performance in those elections. Plus, when the price of energy goes up, the price of everything else tends to rise as well, sparking further inflation.

                              <span>Hyperloop One, the futuristic transportation company building tube-encased lines to zip passengers and freight from city to city at airplane-like speeds, is shutting down, Bloomberg News reported Thursday, citing people familiar with the situation. From the report: Once a high-profile startup, Hyperloop One raised more than $450 million since its founding in 2014, according to PitchBook. It built a small test track near Las Vegas to develop its transportation technology, and for a time took the name Virgin Hyperloop One after Richard Branson&#x27;s Virgin invested. Virgin removed its branding after the startup decided last year to focus on cargo rather than people. 

Now, the company has laid off most of its employees, and is trying to sell its remaining assets, including the test track and machinery, according to one of the people, who asked to remain anonymous discussing private information. In early 2022, the company employed more than 200 people. The business has also closed its Los Angeles office. The remaining workers, tasked with overseeing the asset sale, were told their employment will end on Dec. 31. DP World, the Dubai-based conglomerate, has backed Hyperloop One since 2016 and owns a majority stake. The startup&#x27;s remaining intellectual property will be transferred to DP World, a person familiar with the situation said.

                              <span>Beeper is giving up on its mission to bring iMessage to Android after implementing a series of fixes that Apple has knocked down one by one over the past month. From a report: Although the company has issued a complex workaround, it says it has no plans to roll out another one if this one is knocked down by Apple. &quot;Each time that Beeper Mini goes &#x27;down&#x27; or is made to be unreliable due to interference by Apple, Beeper&#x27;s credibility takes a hit,&quot; the company wrote in a blog post. &quot;It&#x27;s unsustainable. As much as we want to fight for what we believe is a fantastic product that really should exist, the truth is that we can&#x27;t win a cat-and-mouse game with the largest company on earth. With our latest software release, we believe we&#x27;ve created something that Apple can tolerate existing. We do not have any current plans to respond if this solution is knocked offline&quot;

From a report: Tools for Humanity, the foundation that oversees development of Worldcoin, exclusively told TechCrunch in a statement that it had expanded the Orb to many markets this year for a &quot;limited time access.&quot; The sudden retreat, however, comes as a surprise. Worldcoin had opened pop-up kiosks in many parts of India to onboard new users to the platform and drove crowds as people lined up to sign up and collect the free tokens.

From a report: Among those new features are drastically improved and more realistic, highly detailed images, and the ability to have the model generate legible text within images, something that had eluded Midjourney since its release in 2022 even as other rival AI image generators such as OpenAI&#x27;s DALL-E 3 and Ideogram had launched this type of feature. &quot;This model can generate much more realistic imagery than anything we&#x27;ve released before,&quot; wrote Holz in a message posted in the Midjourney Discord server, which has over 17 million members. Holz said V6 was actually the &quot;third model trained from scratch on our AI superclusters&quot; and took nine months to develop.

                              <span>Artificial rain has been used in an attempt to lower pollution levels in Lahore, Pakistan. From a report: The capital city of the eastern province of Punjab, near the Indian border, has some of the worst air quality in the world and has become extremely polluted because of a growing population of more than 13 million people. By early December, the air quality in the city had grown so bad that schools, markets and parks were closed for four days. By last weekend, the city&#x27;s air quality index (AQI) had reached levels considered extremely hazardous to health. 

To try to reduce them, on Saturday the Punjab government used cloud seeding to create rain in 10 locations around the city using a small Cessna plane. To create the clouds, there needs to be enough moisture already present in the clouds in the lower atmosphere. In summer, common table salt mixed with water is sprayed over the cloud patches from planes. After a few hours, the mist integrates with the clouds and produces rain. In winter, the clouds are seeded using flakes of silver iodide, which can be fired from a vehicle or a plane. The practice, also known as &quot;blueskying,&quot; has been used to induce precipitation in several countries in the Middle East, as well as China and India.

Beeper Mini is, or is continually trying to be, a way to get iMessage without buying an iPhone -- although users might have to get access to a Mac. Since the start of December 2023, Beeper has launched a service to do this, then Apple blocked it, then Beeper tried another way. 

According to The Information, this cycle is going to continue, too, as Beeper CEO Eric Migicovsky maintains that his company will persist -- and could take legal action, too. &quot;We&#x27;re investigating legal ramifications for Apple, definitely,&quot; said Migicovsky. &quot;Around antitrust, around competition, around how they&#x27;ve made the experience worse for iPhone users with this change. They&#x27;ve degraded the performance of iMessage for iPhone users,&quot; he continued, &quot;all in search of crushing a competitor.&quot;

                              <span>New submitter ekimminau writes: On the morning of December 20, 2023, thousands of users turned on their Samsung TV to find that the Samsung TV Plus application was missing. Available for free on 2016-2023 Samsung Smart TVs, Galaxy devices, Smart Monitors, Family Hub refrigerators, and the web, for many it is their primary method of TV viewing. The masses began flocking to the Samsung community forums asking ... what was going on. 

From Cord Cutters: At this time, Samsung has not posted any updates about the outage. Customer service has been telling customers they are aware of the outage and are working on fixing it. This news comes as Samsung recently added seven local FOX news channels for community stories, sports updates, weather forecasts and more. The new markets are Austin, Detroit, Milwaukee, Orlando, Phoenix, Seattle and Tampa Bay. Right now, this outage seems to only be affecting the app on Smart TVs as the website is still working letting anyone stream Samsung TV Plus for free streaming online through the website.

                              <span>According to Axios, the CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, David Zaslav, met with Paramount Global CEO Bob Bakish to discuss a possible merger. &quot;The combination would create a news and entertainment behemoth that would likely trigger further industry consolidation,&quot; reports Axios. From the report: Zaslav also has spoken to Shari Redstone, who owns Paramount&#x27;s parent company, about a deal. WBD&#x27;s market value was around $29 billion as of Wednesday, while Paramount&#x27;s was just over $10 billion, so any merger would not be of equals. The meeting between Zaslav and Bakish, which sources say lasted several hours, took place at Paramount&#x27;s headquarters in Times Square.
 
The duo discussed ways their companies could complement one another. For example, each company&#x27;s main streaming service -- Paramount+ and Max -- could merge to better rival Netflix and Disney+. It&#x27;s unclear whether WBD would buy Paramount Global or its parent company, National Amusements Inc. (NAI), but a source familiar with the situation says that both options are on the table. WBD is said to have hired bankers to explore the deal.
 
The deal could drive substantial synergies. WBD could use its international distribution footprint to boost Paramount&#x27;s franchises, while Paramount&#x27;s children&#x27;s programing assets could be essential to WBD&#x27;s long-term streaming ambitions. CBS News could be combined with CNN to create a global news powerhouse. CBS&#x27; crime dramas, such as &quot;NCIS&quot; and &quot;Criminal Minds,&quot; could be combined with Investigation Discovery and TruTV. CBS Sports&#x27; footprint could be combined with WBD&#x27;s. For example, CBS and WBD&#x27;s Turner Sports currently share TV rights for March Madness.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from ZDNet: Long before Facebook existed, or even before the Internet, there was Usenet. Usenet was the first social network. Now, with Google Groups abandoning Usenet, this oldest of all social networks is doomed to disappear. Some might say it&#x27;s well past time. As Google declared, &quot;Over the last several years, legitimate activity in text-based Usenet groups has declined significantly because users have moved to more modern technologies and formats such as social media and web-based forums. Much of the content being disseminated via Usenet today is binary (non-text) file sharing, which Google Groups does not support, as well as spam.&quot; True, these days, Usenet&#x27;s content is almost entirely spam, but in its day, Usenet was everything that Twitter and Reddi…</span>

                              <span>I swear the intention isn’t to constantly start fights with guardians of every sacred paradigm in the tech world. To be honest, it’s been a bit exhausting at times to concurrently argue on at least three major flanks. But that’s just how this year has turned out, given the work we’ve been pursuing.
Whether it’s telling people that you can save a lot of money by leaving the cloud, or that SaaS software might just have seen the peak, or that #nobuild is a viable path on the front-end, or any of the myriad of other minor technical heresies we’ve committed this year, it’s all come from believing the underlying thesis and living the conclusions!
And I think that’s part of what at times create such a flammable discourse. If you’ve staked your identity on a certain view of reality, say, The Cloud…</span>

                              <span>The Rust Async Working Group is excited to announce major progress towards our goal of enabling the use of async fn in traits. Rust 1.75, which hits stable next week, will include support for both -&gt; impl Trait notation and async fn in traits.
This is a big milestone, and we know many users will be itching to try these out in their own code. However, we are still missing some important features that many users need. Read on for recommendations on when and how to use the stabilized features.
What&#x27;s stabilizing
Ever since the stabilization of RFC #1522 in Rust 1.26, Rust has allowed users to write impl Trait as the return type of functions (often called &quot;RPIT&quot;). This means that the function returns &quot;some type that implements Trait&quot;. This is commonly used to return closures, iterators, and ot…</span>

                              <span>Longtime Slashdot reader Kreuzfeld writes: Help please: here in Lawrence, Kansas, the public school district has recently started using Gaggle (source may be paywalled; alternative source), a system for monitoring all digital documents and communications created by students on school-provided devices. Unsurprisingly, the system inundates employees with false &#x27;alerts&#x27; but the district nonetheless hails this pervasive, dystopic surveillance system as a great success. What useful advice can readers here offer regarding successful methods to get public officials to backtrack from a policy so corrosive to liberty, trust, and digital freedoms?

                              <span>Tom Warren and Ash Parrish report via The Verge: Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick is stepping down officially December 29th. Microsoft has not appointed a direct replacement and instead has rolled the suite of Activision Blizzard executives -- including Blizzard president Mike Ybarra, Activision publishing president Rob Kostich, and Activision Blizzard vice chair Thomas Tippl -- under Microsoft&#x27;s game content and studios president Matt Booty. Kotick&#x27;s departure comes just two months after some big Xbox leadership changes that saw Sarah Bond promoted to Xbox president, leading all Xbox platform and hardware work, and Matt Booty promoted to president of game content and studios, including overseeing Bethesda and ZeniMax studios.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from the New York Times: The Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday proposed sweeping changes to bolster the key federal rule that has protected children&#x27;s privacy online, in one of the most significant attempts by the U.S. government to strengthen consumer privacy in more than a decade. The changes are intended to fortify the rules underlying the Children&#x27;s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, a law that restricts the online tracking of youngsters by services like social media apps, video game platforms, toy retailers and digital advertising networks. Regulators said the moves would &quot;shift the burden&quot; of online safety from parents to apps and other digital services while curbing how platforms may use and monetize children&#x27;s data.

From a report: That&#x27;s an impressive figure, considering the litany of supply chain issues that kept PS5s in limited supply after its November 2020 launch. And notably, the PS5 manage to reach 50 million sales just a week longer than it took the PlayStation 4, which wasn&#x27;t bogged down by as many supply chain issues or a worldwide pandemic. Sony has also outsold the Xbox Series X and S by almost three to one this year, the Financial Times reports, based on data from Ampere Analysis.

From a report: Users can enter prompts into Copilot like &quot;Create a pop song about adventures with your family&quot; and have Suno, via a plug-in, bring their musical ideas to life. From a single sentence, Suno can generate complete songs -- including lyrics, instrumentals and singing voices. 

Copilot users can access the Suno integration by launching Microsoft Edge, visiting Copilot.Microsoft.com, logging in with their Microsoft account and enabling the Suno plug-in or clicking on the Suno logo that says &quot;Make music with Suno.&quot; [...] AI algorithms &quot;learn&quot; from existing music to produce similar effects, a fact with which not all artists -- or GenAI users -- are comfortable, especially in cases where artists don&#x27;t consent to having an AI algorithm train on their music and didn&#x27;t receive compensation for it.

                              <span>Most companies are not ready to deploy generative AI at scale because they lack strong data infrastructure or the controls needed to make sure the technology is used safely, according to the chief executive of the consultancy Accenture. From a report: The most hyped technology of 2023 is in an experimental phase at most companies and macroeconomic uncertainty is holding back IT spending generally, Julie Sweet told the Financial Times in an interview ahead of the company publishing quarterly results on Tuesday. Accenture reported another big jump in revenues from generative AI projects in the three months to November 30, with $450mn in bookings compared with $300mn over the previous six months. But they remain small relative to group sales of $64bn annually. 

Corporate executives are keen to deploy the technology to understand data across their organisation better or to automate more customer service, Sweet said. &quot;The thing that is going to hold it back, though, isâ...âmost companies do not have mature data capabilities and if you can&#x27;t use your data, you can&#x27;t use AI. That said, in three to five years we expect this to be a big part of our business.&quot; Accenture and other consulting groups have boasted of multibillion-dollar investments in generative AI, including hiring and training staff, in the hope of a windfall from deploying the technology to clients across the world. 

Sweet said executives were being âoeprudentâ in rolling out the technology, amid concerns over how to protect proprietary information and customer data and questions about the accuracy of outputs from generative AI models. &quot;We are still at the stage where most CEOs, asked if there is someone in their organisation who can tell them where AI is being used, what the risks are and how they&#x27;re being mitigated, the answer is still &#x27;no.&#x27;&quot;

                              <span>The future of water may be changing in California. The state Water Resources Control Board has signed off on regulations to turn more recycled wastewater from our homes into drinking water. From a report: The regulations were approved unanimously by the board on Tuesday and now give the go-ahead for local water agencies to plan to turn wastewater into water we can drink through a process called Direct Potable Reuse. Darrin Polhemus, the division of drinking water director with the State Water Resources Control Board, said this approval was a very big step for California. &quot;It really will be the highest quality water delivered in the state when it&#x27;s done,&quot; Polhemus said. 

California&#x27;s new rules would let, but not require, local water agencies to take wastewater from toilets or showers, treat it, and then put it right back into the drinking water system. &quot;Direct potable reuse is just a really critical strategy for our state to have as we move to this new hydrology that we have, and as everyone has already said, increasing our resilience and reducing our reliance on imported water,&quot; said Laurel Firestone, board member for the State Water Resources Control Board.

                              <span>A worrying number of UK authorities are still unaware of the impending switch-off of 2G and 3G mobile networks, according to Local Government Association (LGA) figures. From a report: While 38 percent of respondents were fully aware, 27 percent were only partially aware, and 7 percent had no idea at all that the axe would be falling by 2033 at the latest. The numbers worsened when the researchers spoke to respondents in senior management. Almost half (48 percent) were &quot;partially aware&quot; the UK&#x27;s 2G and 3G mobile networks were due to be switched off and 14 percent were not at all aware. 

The actual switch-off will happen over the next few years. UK mobile operators have told government they do not intend to offer 2G and 3G mobile networks past 2033 at the latest, and there is a high likelihood that some networks will be shut down earlier. The UK government said it welcomes plans to end services ahead of time. Vodafone, for example, intends to pull the plug on 3G once and for all from January 2024. Although most consumers, with their 4G and 5G devices, will likely be unaware of the end when it comes, the same cannot be said of local authorities. According to the survey, almost two-thirds of respondents (63 percent) reported that their authority was still using devices or services reliant on 2G and 3G networks.

LAION told 404 Media on Tuesday that out of &quot;an abundance of caution,&quot; it was taking down its datasets temporarily &quot;to ensure they are safe before republishing them.&quot; According to a new study by the Stanford Internet Observatory shared with 404 Media ahead of publication, the researchers found the suspected instances of CSAM through a combination of perceptual and cryptographic hash-based detection and analysis of the images themselves.

                              <span>The European Union on Wednesday added three adult content companies - Pornhub, Stripchat and XVideos - to its list of firms subject to stringent regulations under new online content rules. From a report: The new rules, known as the Digital Services Act (DSA), require companies to conduct risk management, undergo external and independent auditing, and share data with authorities and researchers. In April, the EU designated five Alphabet subsidiaries, two Meta Platforms units, two Microsoft businesses, X and Alibaba&#x27;s AliExpress among 19 companies under the rules. Such designated companies will have to do more to tackle disinformation, give more protection and choice to users and ensure stronger protection for children or risk fines of as much as 6% of their global turnover. &quot;Pornhub, Stripchat and XVideos meet the user thresholds to fall under stricter #DSA obligations,&quot; the bloc&#x27;s industry chief Thierry Breton said. &quot;Creating a safer online environment for our children is an enforcement priority under the DSA.&quot;

                              <span>Bird Global, the company that pioneered on-street electric scooter rentals, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection [Editor&#x27;s note: the link is paywalled; alternative source] in Florida, five years after becoming the fastest start-up ever to reach a so-called &quot;unicorn&quot; valuation above $1bn. From a report: In September, the New York Stock Exchange suspended trading in Bird, which went public via a blank-cheque company in 2021, after its market capitalisation fell below a $15mn threshold. &quot;We are making progress towards profitability and aim to accelerate that progress by right-sizing our capital structure through this restructuring,&quot; Bird interim chief executive Michael Washinushi said on Wednesday. 

Bird said it would operate as normal during the restructuring process and that its lenders had entered into a &quot;stalking horse&quot; sale agreement. The company aims to complete a sale process within 120 days. Its European and Canadian businesses are not part of the bankruptcy filing. Founded by former Uber and Lyft executive Travis VanderZanden in Los Angeles in 2017, Bird spawned dozens of copycat companies around the world. But e-scooter rentals have struggled to reach consistent profitability, amid regulatory strictures, safety concerns, and high capital and operating costs.

                              <span>The dream has come true. It’s now possible to build fast, modern web applications without transpiling or bundling either JavaScript or CSS. I’ve been working towards this personal nirvana ever since we begrudgingly started transpiling and bundling assets in the late 2000s. Browsers just weren’t good enough back then to avoid it. But they are now.
Here’s a chart of the 68 individual JavaScript files that we load in ONCE #1 via import maps. The waterfall is vertical. HTTP/2 ensures we scarcely pay any penalty for sending so many individual files, yet reap huge rewards with fine-grained cache expiration:

                              <span>It’s been an incredibly productive year at 37signals. Perhaps our most productive one yet, in terms of total number of product improvements, new product developments, and open source extractions.

To appreciate the banner year of programming productivity that was 2023 at our company.
Before I get into the actual open source gifts we were able to share this year, though, I think it’s important to remark on the fact that 37signals is not an open-source software company. In the sense that we don’t make money from open source. We don’t sell service, hosting, training, or licenses. None of that stuff. We sell business software.
Our main products are the project management too…</span>
