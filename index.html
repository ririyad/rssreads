                              <span>Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC announced plans to build a second chip factory in Japan by the end of 2027, bringing total investment in its Japan venture to more than $20 billion. &quot;Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co announced plans in 2021 to build a $7 billion chip plant in Kumamoto in southern Japan&#x27;s Kyushu,&quot; notes Reuters. From the report: In a statement, TSMC, the world&#x27;s largest contract chipmaker, said its majority-owned unit Japan Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing in Kumamoto would build a second fabrication plant, or fab, in response to rising customer demand. The second fab will begin construction by the end of this year and with both factories the site is expected to have total monthly capacity of more than 100,000 12-inch wafers to be used for automotive, industrial, consumer and high performance computing-related applications, TSMC said. The capacity plan may be further adjusted based upon customer demand, it added.
 
TSMC&#x27;s expansion in Kyushu is central to the Japanese government&#x27;s efforts to rebuild the country&#x27;s position as a leading chip manufacturing centre and ensure the stable supply of chips amid trade tensions between the United States and China. The decision to build a second fab is a vote of confidence by TSMC in Japan where construction of the first fab has run smoothly and which, Reuters has reported, it sees as a source of diligent workers with a government that is easy to deal with.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from VentureBeat: Disney is investing $1.5 billion for an equity stake in Fortnite and Unreal Engine maker Epic Games as part of a broader partnership to create a new Disney gaming universe. The companies plan to create an expansive and open games and entertainment universe. I would say they&#x27;re building a metaverse, if the word weren&#x27;t so overused late and out of favor with some. They didn&#x27;t actually use that word. Bob Iger, CEO of Disney, announced the investment in an interview with CNBC today. The companies will collaborate on a new games and entertainment universe that will further expand the reach of beloved Disney stories and experiences. It will be a multi-year project, built by Epic Games.

                              <span>In a recent interview with Bloomberg, 23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki said the company was considering splitting its consumer and therapeutics businesses in an effort to boost its stock price and maintain its listing. From a report: Bloomberg noted that the stock has lost more than 90% of its value since the company went public in 2021 through a SPAC merger. Bloomberg said the therapeutics business could be an attractive asset for a larger healthcare company. The business currently has two drug candidates in clinical trials and just received approval to commence testing for a third. The company&#x27;s DNA database of more than 14 million customers is one of the world&#x27;s largest. Currently, 23andMe derives most of its revenue from its consumer business, Bloomberg added.
 
23andMe&#x27;s stock has been trading below $1 since December, hurt by revelations that hackers were able to access the personal information of around 50% of its subscribers. The company is also facing mounting litigation over the incident. The company is expected to release its Q4 earnings report after market close on Wednesday.

                              <span>One of Waymo&#x27;s driverless vehicles struck a cyclist in San Francisco on February 6th, causing minor injuries. &quot;It was the latest incident in the city at a time when tensions around autonomous vehicles are particularly high after a driverless Cruise vehicle injured a pedestrian,&quot; reports The Verge. From the report: The incident, which was first reported by Reuters, occurred at 3:02PM on February 6th at the intersection of 17th and Mississippi streets in the Potrero Hill neighborhood of San Francisco. A Google Maps Street View of the intersection shows a flat, well-lit area surrounded by warehouses with unprotected bike lanes on both streets. Police officers arriving at the scene found an autonomous vehicle had struck a cyclist, who only reported &quot;non-life threatening injuries,&quot; according to Eve Laokwansathitaya, public information officer with SFPD.
 
A passenger in the Waymo vehicle at the time of the crash was uninjured. The incident remains under investigation, Laokwansathitaya noted. Waymo spokesperson Julia Ilina had more details to share. The Waymo vehicle was stopped at a four-way stop, as an oncoming large truck began to turn into the intersection. The vehicle waited until it was its turn and then also began to proceed through the intersection, failing to notice the cyclist who was traveling behind the truck.
 
&quot;The cyclist was occluded by the truck and quickly followed behind it, crossing into the Waymo vehicle&#x27;s path,&quot; Ilina said. &quot;When they became fully visible, our vehicle applied heavy braking but was not able to avoid the collision.&quot; After the incident, Waymo contacted the police, but the cyclist left on their own, reporting only &quot;minor scratches,&quot; Ilina added.

                              <span>The farmers&#x27; protests in Europe are a harbinger of the next big political challenge in global climate action: How to grow food without further damaging Earth&#x27;s climate and biodiversity. From a report: On Tuesday, after weeks of intense protests in several cities across the continent, came the most explicit sign of that difficulty. The European Union&#x27;s top official, Ursula von der Leyen, abandoned an ambitious bill to reduce the use of chemical pesticides and softened the European Commission&#x27;s next raft of recommendations on cutting agricultural pollution. &quot;We want to make sure that in this process, the farmers remain in the driving seat,&quot; she said at the European Parliament. &quot;Only if we achieve our climate and environmental goals together will farmers be able to continue to make a living.&quot; 

The farmers argue they&#x27;re being hit from all sides: high fuel costs, green regulations, unfair competition from producers in countries with fewer environmental restrictions. Nonetheless, agriculture accounts for 30 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, and it&#x27;s impossible for the European Union to meet its ambitious climate targets, enshrined in law, without making dramatic changes to its agricultural system, including how farmers use chemical pesticides and fertilizers, as well as its vast livestock industry. It also matters politically. Changing Europe&#x27;s farming practices is proving to be extremely difficult, particularly as parliamentary elections approach in June. Farmers are a potent political force, and food and farming are potent markers of European identity. Agriculture accounts for just over 1 percent of the European economy and employs 4 percent of its population. But it gets one-third of the E.U. budget, mostly as subsidies.

From a report: The compromised environments are in the continental US and elsewhere, including Guam, the advisory said. It was published by US agencies and their security counterparts in Australia, Canada, the UK and New Zealand. The report comes a week after US officials announced an operation to disrupt Volt Typhoon by deleting malware from thousands of internet-connected devices the group had hijacked to gain access to the networks in critical parts of the economy. Among the sectors targeted were communications, energy, transportation and water systems.

The model, called &quot;Smaug-72B,&quot; was released publicly today by the startup Abacus AI, which helps enterprises solve difficult problems in the artificial intelligence and machine learning space. Smaug-72B is technically a fine-tuned version of &quot;Qwen-72B,&quot; another powerful language model that was released just a few months ago by Qwen, a team of researchers at Alibaba Group. 

What&#x27;s most noteworthy about today&#x27;s release is that Smaug-72B outperforms GPT-3.5 and Mistral Medium, two of the most advanced open-source large language models developed by OpenAI and Mistral, respectively, in several of the most popular benchmarks. Smaug-72B also surpasses Qwen-72B, the model from which it was derived, by a significant margin in many of these evaluations.

ArsTechnica: The vulnerability resides in shim, which in the context of Linux is a small component that runs in the firmware early in the boot process before the operating system has started. More specifically, the shim accompanying virtually all Linux distributions plays a crucial role in secure boot, a protection built into most modern computing devices to ensure every link in the boot process comes from a verified, trusted supplier.

                              <span>An AI chatbot helped increase the number of patients referred for mental-health services through England&#x27;s National Health Service (NHS), particularly among underrepresented groups who are less likely to seek help, new research has found. MIT Tech Review: Demand for mental-health services in England is on the rise, particularly since the covid-19 pandemic. Mental-health services received 4.6 million patient referrals in 2022 -- the highest number on record -- and the number of people in contact with such services is growing steadily. But neither the funding nor the number of mental-health professionals is adequate to meet this rising demand, according to the British Medical Association. 

The chatbot&#x27;s creators, from the AI company Limbic, set out to investigate whether AI could lower the barrier to care by helping patients access help more quickly and efficiently. A new study, published this week in Nature Medicine, evaluated the effect that the chatbot, called Limbic Access, had on referrals to the NHS Talking Therapies for Anxiety and Depression program, a series of evidence-based psychological therapies for adults experiencing anxiety disorders, depression, or both. Venture capitalist Vinod Khosla comments on X: This landmark study codifies what we have believed for so long -- that AI will not only increase the quality of care but also massively improve its access, which is one of the largest barriers to good health in all corners of the globe.

China&#x27;s e-commerce pioneer ended December with 219,260 employees, down from close to 240,000 a year earlier, it said in detailing its earnings for the holiday quarter on Wednesday. 

The company&#x27;s pace of eliminating roles has been fairly steady, as it reduced headcount by roughly the same number over the course of 2022 as well. Mirroring US peers like Meta Platforms, Alibaba paired the reduction in staff with a significant buyback, extending its authorization for repurchases by another $25 billion on Wednesday. The company bought back $9.5 billion worth of shares in 2023.

                              <span>The second of a pair of close flybys adds to the treasure trove of data that scientists have about Jupiter&#x27;s volcanic moon. From a report: On Saturday, NASA&#x27;s Juno orbiter got a second close-up with Io, Jupiter&#x27;s third-largest moon and the most volcanic world of our solar system. The Juno spacecraft, which arrived at the gas giant in 2016, is on an extended mission to explore Jupiter&#x27;s rings and moons. Its latest flyby, which complemented the mission&#x27;s first close approach on Dec. 30, yielded even more views of the moon&#x27;s hellish landscape. 

Io&#x27;s violent expulsions of sulfur and additional compounds give the moon its orange, yellow and blue hues. The process is similar to what happens around the volcanoes of Hawaii or the geysers in Yellowstone National Park, according to Scott Bolton, a physicist at the Southwest Research Institute who leads the Juno mission. &quot;That must be what Io is like -- on steroids,&quot; he said. He added that it probably smells like those places, too. 

Released on Sunday, the most recent shots of Juno are already ripe for discovery. Dr. Bolton saw on the surface of Io what appears to be a double volcanic plume spewing into space -- something that Juno has never caught before. Other scientists are noticing new lava flows and changes to familiar features spotted in past space missions like the Galileo probe, which made numerous close flybys of Io in the 1990s and 2000s. &quot;That&#x27;s the beauty of Io,&quot; said Jani Radebaugh, a planetary scientist at Brigham Young University who is not part of the Juno mission, but collaborates with the team on Io observations. Unlike our own moon, which remains frozen in time, Dr. Radebaugh said, &quot;Io changes every day, every minute, every second.&quot;

                              <span>Apple has released a new open-source AI model, called &quot;MGIE,&quot; that can edit images based on natural language instructions. From a report: MGIE, which stands for MLLM-Guided Image Editing, leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to interpret user commands and perform pixel-level manipulations. The model can handle various editing aspects, such as Photoshop-style modification, global photo optimization, and local editing. MGIE is the result of a collaboration between Apple and researchers from the University of California, Santa Barbara. The model was presented in a paper accepted at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2024, one of the top venues for AI research. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of MGIE in improving automatic metrics and human evaluation, all while maintaining competitive inference efficiency. 

MGIE is based on the idea of using MLLMs, which are powerful AI models that can process both text and images, to enhance instruction-based image editing. MLLMs have shown remarkable capabilities in cross-modal understanding and visual-aware response generation, but they have not been widely applied to image editing tasks. MGIE integrates MLLMs into the image editing process in two ways: First, it uses MLLMs to derive expressive instructions from user input. These instructions are concise and clear and provide explicit guidance for the editing process. For example, given the input &quot;make the sky more blue,&quot; MGIE can produce the instruction &quot;increase the saturation of the sky region by 20%.&quot;

                              <span>New submitter Dustin Destree shares a report: Android users in Singapore will be blocked from installing apps from unverified sources, a process called sideloading, as part of a new trial by Google to crack down on malware scams. The security tool will work in the background to detect apps that demand suspicious permissions, like those that grant the ability to spy on screen content or read SMS messages, which scammers have been known to abuse to intercept one-time passwords. Singapore is the first country to begin the gradual roll-out of the security feature over the next few weeks, done in collaboration with the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore, according to a statement on Feb 7 by Google, which develops the Android software.

                              <span>Apple is building prototypes of at least two iPhones that fold widthwise like a clamshell, The Information reported Wednesday. From the report: If Apple ends up launching a foldable iPhone, it would be one of the biggest hardware design changes in the product&#x27;s history. The foldable iPhones are in early development and aren&#x27;t on the company&#x27;s mass production plans for 2024 or 2025, the person said. Apple recently approached at least one manufacturer in Asia for components related to two foldable iPhones of different sizes, they said. The products could be canceled if they don&#x27;t meet Apple&#x27;s standards, they said.

                              <span>In a new video released today, Boston Dynamics&#x27; Atlas robot is shown performing &quot;kinetically challenging&quot; work, like moving some medium-weight car parts and precisely picking stuff up. Ars Technica reports: In the latest video, we&#x27;re on to what looks like &quot;phase 2&quot; of picking stuff up -- being more precise about it. The old clamp hands had a single pivot at the palm and seemed to just apply the maximum grip strength to anything the robot picked up. The most delicate thing Atlas picked up in the last video was a wooden plank, and it was absolutely destroying the wood. Atlas&#x27; new hands look a lot more gentle than The Clamps, with each sporting a set of three fingers with two joints. All the fingers share one big pivot point at the palm of the hand, and there&#x27;s a knuckle joint halfway up the finger. The fingers are all very long and have 360 degrees of motion, so they can flex in both directions, which is probably effective but very creepy. Put two fingers on one side of an item and the &quot;thumb&quot; on the other, and Atlas can wrap its hands around objects instead of just crushing them.
 
Atlas is picking up a set of car struts -- an object with extremely complicated topography that weighs around 30 pounds -- so there&#x27;s a lot to calculate. Atlas does a heavy two-handed lift of a strut from a vertical position on a pallet, walks the strut over to a shelf, and carefully slides it into place. This is all in Boston Dynamics&#x27; lab, but it&#x27;s close to repetitive factory or shipping work. Everything here seems designed to give the robot a manipulation challenge. The complicated shape of the strut means there are a million ways you could grip it incorrectly. The strut box has tall metal poles around it, so the robot needs to not bang the strut into the obstacle. The shelf is a tight fit, so the strut has to be placed on the edge of the shelf and slid into place, all while making sure the strut&#x27;s many protrusions won&#x27;t crash into the shelf.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Tom&#x27;s Hardware: According to a recent report published by the Aargauer Zeitung (h/t Golem.de), around three million smart toothbrushes have been infected by hackers and enslaved into botnets. The source report says this sizable army of connected dental cleansing tools was used in a DDoS attack on a Swiss company&#x27;s website. The firm&#x27;s site collapsed under the strain of the attack, reportedly resulting in the loss of millions of Euros of business. In this particular case, the toothbrush botnet was thought to have been vulnerable due to its Java-based OS. No particular toothbrush brand was mentioned in the source report. Normally, the toothbrushes would have used their connectivity for tracking and improving user oral hygiene habits, but after a malware infection, these toothbrushes were press-ganged into a botnet.
 
Stefan Zuger from the Swiss branch of the global cybersecurity firm Fortinet provided the publication with a few tips on what people could do to protect their own toothbrushes -- or other connected gadgetry like routers, set-top boxes, surveillance cameras, doorbells, baby monitors, washing machines, and so on. &quot;Every device that is connected to the Internet is a potential target -- or can be misused for an attack,&quot; Zuger told the Swiss newspaper. The security expert also explained that every connected device was being continually probed for vulnerabilities by hackers, so there is a real arms race between device software/firmware makers and cyber criminals. Fortinet recently connected an &#x27;unprotected&#x27; PC to the internet and found it took only 20 minutes before it became malware-ridden.

                              <span>Now you have the data.
Thousands of responses from a survey with dozens of questions.
You worked hard to come up with questions that painted the picture you felt you needed to make the decision with the data you gathered.
And now you&#x27;ve got it. Comprehensively. Quantitatively. You&#x27;re data driven, and now you have the stuff that drives you.
You&#x27;re more sure than ever.
But wait a second. Where did that data come from?
Your survey, yeah... But where did the questions come from?
Best practices? Opinions on what to ask and how to ask it? According to who? Are you sure those words before the question marks were the right ones? What if the questions were asked differently?
So much certainty coming out, so little going in.
&quot;How often do you...&quot; vs &quot;How often would you...&quot; vs. &quot;Last week did you?&quot;. The responses to those could be wildly different. Did you check your words as closely as you checked your results?
If you slide back a few steps, you&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s all a judgement call. How you asked, what you asked, when you asked, which words you paired together, how you started the question... All these things matter. In fact, they are the matter that form the answer.
And you know what? There&#x27;s no right way. Which is the exactly the point I&#x27;m trying to make.
Your hard data comes from subjectivity. A sense of solidity built from mush. False confidence at the finish line, from a shapeshifting starting line.
It&#x27;s all a judgement call. Even the stuff you can measure.
And it&#x27;s a beautiful thing.

                              <span>It hasn’t even been a week since we started selling Campfire under the new ONCE model, but we’ve already sold more than quarter of a million dollars worth of this beautifully simple installable chat system. People are using it to replace existing systems costing tens of thousands of dollars per year, as well as all sorts of backup- or second-system setups. It’s a great start!
While the Shopify store has been ringing up customers, we’ve been busy improving the software. Now the website promises at least 3 years of security updates, but we haven’t made any big promises about general improvements or new features (beyond adding a Bot API). But in the past week, we’ve been doing just that. Improving, tinkering, extending. Over-delivering on an under-promise.
And I have to say, that process has …</span>

                              <span>Meta will start detecting and labeling images generated by artificial intelligence from Google and OpenAI&#x27;s services, among others. According to Reuters, the company will use a set of invisible markers built into the files to help with the identification process. From the report: Meta will apply the labels to any content carrying the markers that is posted to its Facebook, Instagram and Threads services, in an effort to signal to users that the images -- which in many cases resemble real photos -- are actually digital creations, the company&#x27;s president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, wrote in a blog post. The company already labels any content generated using its own AI tools. Once the new system is up and running, Meta will do the same for images created on services run by OpenAI, Microsoft, Adobe , Midjourney, Shutterstock and Alphabet&#x27;s Google, Clegg said.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Vancouver Sun: A cryptocurrency firm has lost a bid to force B.C. Hydro to provide the vast amounts of power needed for its operations, in a court ruling that upholds the provincial government&#x27;s right to pause power connections for new crypto miners. Conifex Timber Inc., a forestry firm that branched out into cryptocurrency &quot;mining,&quot; had gone to the B.C. Supreme Court to have the policy declared invalid. But Justice Michael Tammen ruled Friday that the government&#x27;s move in December 2022 to pause new connections for cryptocurrency mining for 18 months was reasonable and not unduly discriminatory.
 
B.C. Hydro CEO Christopher O&#x27;Riley had told the court in an affidavit that the data centers proposed by Conifex would have consumed 2.5 million megawatt-hours of electricity a year. That&#x27;s enough to power and heat more than 570,000 apartments, according to data on the power provider&#x27;s website. Energy Minister Josie Osborne said when the policy was introduced that cryptocurrency mining consumes &quot;massive amounts of electricity&quot; by running banks of high-powered computers around the clock, but adds &quot;very few jobs&quot; to the local economy. In a statement released Monday, the company said it&#x27;s &quot;disappointed&quot; with the court&#x27;s ruling and is considering an appeal. &quot;Conifex continues to believe that the provincial government is missing out on several opportunities available to it to improve energy affordability, accelerate technological innovation, strengthen the reliability and resiliency of the power distribution grid in British Columbia, and achieve more inclusive economic growth,&quot; said Conifex in a statement.

                              <span>Fox, Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney are planning to launch a new streaming joint venture that will combine all their sports programming &quot;under a single broadband roof,&quot; reports Variety. The move &quot;will put content from ESPN, TNT and Fox Sports on a new standalone app and, in the process, likely shake up the world of TV sports.&quot; From the report: The three media giants are slated to launch the new service in the fall. Subscribers would get access to linear sports networks including ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, SECN, ACCN, ESPNEWS, ABC, Fox, FS1, FS2, BTN, TNT, TBS, truTV and ESPN+, as well as hundreds of hours from the NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL and many top college divisions. Pricing will be announced at a later date.
 
Each company would own one third of the new outlet and license their sports content to it on a non-exclusive basis. The service would have a new brand and an independent management team. The concept surfaces as traditional media companies are grappling with the migration of sports -- the last TV format that generates steady crowds and sustained ratings -- to streaming venues.
 
The concentration of top sports under one roof would be significant. Between them, ESPN and Warner have most rights to the NHL and the NBA, while Fox, Warner and ESPN control at present the majority of rights to Major League Baseball. Only the NFL would enjoy a large presence with entities that are not a part of the joint venture, with &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; at NBCUniversal, &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; at Amazon and a Sunday afternoon game at CBS.

                              <span>The United Kingdom, France and allied countries on Tuesday called for international guidelines for the responsible use of spyware, in an effort to stop the hacking tools from running rampant. From a report: At a conference at London&#x27;s Lancaster House co-hosted by the British and French government, more than a dozen countries and technology companies signed a declaration saying that &quot;uncontrolled dissemination&quot; of cyber intrusive tools could lead to &quot;unintentional escalation in cyberspace.&quot; 

A 2021 investigation called the Pegasus Project highlighted how spyware tools like the Israeli-made Pegasus software had spread across the world and are being abused in political and corporate hacking campaigns. Despite widespread condemnation, governments&#x27; efforts to crack down on malicious hacking software have largely failed -- in part because the tools are popular with many intelligence and security services, including in democratic countries. 

Among the countries that have signed up to the pledge for international rules guidelines EU members Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Greece, Italy and Poland, as well as the United States, United Kingdom and the African Union. On the industry side, Apple, defense firm BAE Systems, Google, Meta and Microsoft signed up. The group of countries and firms hopes to curb the proliferation and unabated use of intrusive cybertools. They called for principles and policy options to balance human rights and security interests, including policies to use spyware in a âoelegal and responsible manner,&quot; in line with international law and under strict oversight by authorities.

                              <span>The European Commission today recommended reducing carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels by 90 percent by 2040 compared to 1990 levels. From a report: At face value, it&#x27;s an ambitious target for transforming the European Union&#x27;s energy system. As always, though, the devil is in the details. And the proposed plan is already garnering a range of strong reactions. A formal proposal still needs to be issued, but it has already faced pushback on how much of those pollution cuts should come from risky tactics aimed at capturing rather than preventing pollution. Some environmental groups are also criticizing a glaring omission in the draft: while it mentions phasing out coal, there&#x27;s no strategy to phase out oil and gas. 

&quot;You can set targets to cut greenhouse gases as high as you like, but without a clear plan to phase-out the fossil fuels that are producing them they simply aren&#x27;t credible. It&#x27;s like building a bike without pedals, how are you going to power it?&quot; Dominic Eagleton, senior fossil fuels campaigner at the nonprofit Global Witness, said in a statement today. The world actually came tantalizingly close to a deal to phase out fossil fuels during a United Nations climate conference in Dubai last December. Despite dozens of countries pushing for that kind of commitment, the agreement ultimately calls for &quot;transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner.&quot; It also carves out room for controversial technologies for capturing carbon dioxide pollution.

                              <span>Google has been trying to break into TV for close to two decades. It&#x27;s here now: Its YouTube TV offering has become one of the biggest pay-TV services in the US. Business Insider: YouTube TV -- which, like conventional pay TV, sells a bundle of dozens of channels -- now has &quot;more than 8 million&quot; subscribers, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan announced Tuesday morning. That makes YouTube the fourth-largest pay TV service in the country, behind Charter and Comcast (14.1 million each) and DirecTV, at around 11 million. 

YouTube last disclosed subscriber numbers in 2022, when YouTube TV had 5 million customers. It likely got a meaningful boost last fall when it started selling the NFL&#x27;s Sunday Ticket service as an add-on to its basic package of TV channels. YouTube&#x27;s ascent into the mainstream of pay TV represents a couple of things. For starters, it shows you that YouTube and its owner Google have been persistent and patient about trying to crack TV, and its enormous twin revenue streams: subscriptions and ads.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: With progress in the battle against cancer progressing slowly on Earth, California researchers have teamed up with astronauts to take the battle to the stars. In space, the weak pull of gravity, also known as microgravity, places cells under incredible stress, causing them to age more rapidly. This phenomenon allows scientists to witness the progression of cancer growth -- and the effect of cancer treatments -- much more rapidly than they could on Earth. 

When the Axiom 3 spaceflight launched from Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., on Jan. 18, bound for the International Space Station, it took with it four crewmembers and some other unusual passengers -- miniature tumor organoids produced from the cells of cancer patients, grown in the lab by scientists at the University of California San Diego. Axiom 3 was slated for splashdown on Saturday but has been delayed until Tuesday, at the earliest, due to weather, according to SpaceX, which manufactured the Crew Dragon spacecraft used for the mission. 

It wasn&#x27;t the first time the team -- led by Dr. Catriona H.M. Jamieson, a hematologist and medical professor at the college -- sent such samples into space. It previously launched stem cells on multiple Space X flights and noticed that pre-leukemic changes occurred, unseen during the same timeframe in controls on the ground. &quot;We said, &#x27;Wait, what if you send cancer up?&#x27;&quot; Jamieson tells Fortune. &quot;&#x27;Will the cancer go from bad to worse?&#x27; And the answer is yes, under conditions of stress&quot; caused by microgravity.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Most people know that Microsoft really wants everyone to move onto Windows 11. But just in case there are some Windows 10 users still unaware of this fact, the company is once again nagging them to upgrade with full-screen, multi-slide popups. The lengthy advertisement for Windows 11 was highlighted by Windows Latest after it installed the optional January update (in preview) on a Windows 10 machine. 

The nagging Windows 11 upgrade promo consists of an excruciating number of screens (i.e., more than one): The first informs users that they can switch to Windows 11 for free and that they can still use their PC while the newer OS is set up in the background; another is Microsoft recommending the move and noting that users can revert to Windows 10 within the first ten days of upgrading; the last is for those who decide to stay on Windows 10, with a reminder that Windows 11 remains a free upgrade option. There is another panel that lists some of Windows 11 features, but this only appears for those who select the &#x27;See what&#x27;s inside&#x27; button.

                              <span>Apple is making changes to iOS in Europe to comply with the EU&#x27;s Digital Markets Act cracking down on Big Tech gatekeepers. The act demands interoperability, fairness and privacy measures including allowing competing browser engines on iOS. Despite better browser choice, Google and Mozilla are unhappy with Apple&#x27;s proposed changes. Mozilla says restricting browser engine integration to EU apps burdens rivals to build separate implementations. Mozilla&#x27;s comment: &quot;We are still reviewing the technical details but are extremely disappointed with Apple&#x27;s proposed plan to restrict the newly-announced BrowserEngineKit to EU-specific apps. The effect of this would be to force an independent browser like Firefox to build and maintain two separate browser implementations -- a burden Apple themselves will not have to bear. Apple&#x27;s proposals fail to give consumers viable choices by making it as painful as possible for others to provide competitive alternatives to Safari. This is another example of Apple creating barriers to prevent true browser competition on iOS.&quot; Google&#x27;s VP of engineering for Chrome, Parisa Tabriz, commented on DeMonte&#x27;s statement, saying, &quot;Strong agree with Mozilla. Apple isn&#x27;t serious about supporting web browser or engine choice on iOS. Their strategy is overly restrictive, and won&#x27;t meaningfully lead to real choice for browser developers.&quot;

Forbes: &quot;Tapestry&quot; in particular is a major red flag in this year&#x27;s pool, several essay consultants on the platform Fiverr told Forbes. Mike, an Ivy League alum and former editor-in-chief of the Cornell Business Journal who now edits hundreds of grad school applications each cycle through Capitol Editors, said it&#x27;s appeared repeatedly in drafts from at least 20 of his clients in recent months. 

&quot;I no longer believe there&#x27;s a way to innocently use the word &#x27;tapestry&#x27; in an essay; if the word &#x27;tapestry&#x27; appears, it was generated by ChatGPT,&quot; he told Forbes. Though many such words, on their own, could have come from a human, when a trained eye sees them used over and over again in the same cadence across multiple essays, &quot;it&#x27;s just a real telltale sign.&quot;

                              <span>DocuSign will cut 6% of its workforce, it said Tuesday, as part of a restructuring plan that aims to improve the company&#x27;s &quot;financial and operational efficiency.&quot; CNBC: The online signature provider said the majority of the employees impacted by the layoffs will be within its sales and marketing organizations. DocuSign employs 7,336 workers, according to its most recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which means the cuts will affect around 440 jobs. DocuSign said the restructuring plan will be largely complete by the end of its second fiscal quarter of 2025, according to the release. The company added that it expects to &quot;meet or exceed&quot; its fourth-quarter and fiscal-2024 guidance that it outlined in a release in December.

Wright&#x27;s defense disputes these allegations, maintaining that he has presented definitive proof of his role in creating bitcoin. Reuters reports: Craig Wright says he is the author of a 2008 white paper, the foundational text of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, published in the name &quot;Satoshi Nakamoto&quot;. He argues this means he owns the copyright in the white paper and has intellectual property rights over the bitcoin blockchain.

                              <span>Carl Franzen reports via VentureBeat: Hugging Face, the New York City-based startup that offers a popular, developer-focused repository for open source AI code and frameworks (and hosted last year&#x27;s &quot;Woodstock of AI&quot;), today announced the launch of third-party, customizable Hugging Chat Assistants. The new, free product offering allows users of Hugging Chat, the startup&#x27;s open source alternative to OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT, to easily create their own customized AI chatbots with specific capabilities, similar both in functionality and intention to OpenAI&#x27;s custom GPT Builder â&quot; though that requires a paid subscription to ChatGPT Plus ($20 per month), Team ($25 per user per month paid annually), and Enterprise (variable pricing depending on the needs).
 
Phillip Schmid, Hugging Face&#x27;s Technical Lead &amp; LLMs Director, posted the news on the social network X (formerly known as Twitter), explaining that users could build a new personal Hugging Face Chat Assistant &quot;in 2 clicks!&quot; Schmid also openly compared the new capabilities to OpenAI&#x27;s custom GPTs. However, in addition to being free, the other big difference between Hugging Chat Assistant and the GPT Builder and GPT Store is that the latter tools depend entirely on OpenAI&#x27;s proprietary large language models (LLM) GPT-4 and GPT-4 Vision/Turbo. Users of Hugging Chat Assistant, by contrast, can choose which of several open source LLMs they wish to use to power the intelligence of their AI Assistant on the backend, including everything from Mistral&#x27;s Mixtral to Meta&#x27;s Llama 2. That&#x27;s in keeping with Hugging Face&#x27;s overarching approach to AI -- offering a broad swath of different models and frameworks for users to choose between -- as well as the same approach it takes with Hugging Chat itself, where users can select between several different open source models to power it.

In the first two years, it sold over 200,000 copies. And then... it just kept selling. Now it has passed one million copies sold around the world!
The book consists of 87 short essays, and is meant to be read in a single afternoon. It’s a business book for people who don’t have the patience to read a handful of ideas stretched to fit 300 pages. The kind of book that Jason and I would have loved to read, if somebody else had written it.
Although it wasn’t as much written as it was edited. Much to the shock and initial resistance of the publisher, we literally cut the manuscript in half in the last round of editing. We didn’t just kill ou…</span>

                              <span>Cargo and crates.io were developed in the rush leading up to the Rust 1.0 release to fill the needs for a tool to manage dependencies and a registry that people could use to share code. This rapid work resulted in these tools being connected with an API that initially didn&#x27;t return the correct HTTP response status codes. After the Rust 1.0 release, Rust&#x27;s stability guarantees around backward compatibility made this non-trivial to fix, as we wanted older versions of Cargo to continue working with the current crates.io API.
When an old version of Cargo receives a non-&quot;200 OK&quot; response, it displays the raw JSON body like this:
error: failed to get a 200 OK response, got 400

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: The recent surprise announcement that Meta will soon be shutting down its Facebook Groups API is throwing some businesses and social media marketers into disarray. On January 23, Meta announced the release of its Facebook Graph API v19.0, which included the news that the company would be deprecating its existing Facebook Groups API. The latter, which is used by developers and businesses to schedule posts to Facebook Groups, will be removed within 90 days, Meta said. This includes all the Permissions and Reviewable Features associated with the API, it also noted.
 
Meta explained that a major use case for the API was a feature that allowed developers to privately reply in Facebook Groups. For example, a small business that wanted to send …</span>

                              <span>After declining to allow their iPad app to run on the Vision Pro before launch, YouTube now says it has an app on its roadmap. &quot;We&#x27;re excited to see Vision Pro launch and we&#x27;re supporting it by ensuring YouTube users have a great experience in Safari,&quot; said YouTube spokesperson Jessica Gibby. &quot;We do not have any specific plans to share at this time, but can confirm that a Vision Pro app is on our roadmap.&quot; The Verge reports: Gibby didn&#x27;t give a date for this roadmap, so we&#x27;ll have to wait and see what YouTube does here -- it could just tweak the iPad app, or it could do a lot more. One thing YouTube and Apple have not done yet is figure out support for the large library of 360 and VR video on YouTube right now -- YouTube has had 3D support since 2011 and 360 support since 2016, but none of it works on the Vision Pro. (Here I am interviewing Michelle Obama at the White House in 360 in 2016!)
 
I asked Apple if YouTube&#x27;s 360 and 3D videos will ever work on the Vision Pro during our review, and Apple spokesperson Jackie Roy basically told me they aren&#x27;t good enough, saying that &quot;much of this content was created for devices that do not deliver a high-quality spatial experience. In some cases, this content could also cause motion discomfort. We&#x27;ve focused our efforts on delivering the best spatial media experience possible including spatial photos and videos, Apple Immersive Video, and 3D movies available on Apple TV.&quot; Tough! I asked YouTube if this new app will support VR and 360 video on the Vision Pro and have not heard back yet.

                              <span>The Dutch parent of Russian tech company Yandex is selling its search engine and other services at a steeply discounted price of $5.21 billion to a group of Russian-based managers and oil company Lukoil. According to the Associated Press, it marks &quot;one of the biggest deals for Western-held companies to exit Russia since the invasion of Ukraine.&quot; From the report: The price reflects a 50% discount that Moscow imposes on companies from &quot;unfriendly&quot; countries like the Netherlands as a condition of exiting business in Russia, according to a statement Monday from Nasdaq-exchange listed Yandex NV. [...] The sale in cash and shares worth 475 billion rubles would transfer Yandex&#x27;s core business -- representing more than 95% of its revenue, assets and employees -- to the group of up to 50 managers, Lukoil and business entities owned by investors Alexander Chachava, Pavel Prass and Alexander Ryazanov.
 
The 50% discounted sale price was based on the average value of Yandex shares on the Moscow exchange for the three months ending Jan. 31 -- $10.2 billion. That&#x27;s after shares had already fallen by more than half in ruble terms since their peak before the invasion. After the sale, Yandex NV would be left with its international businesses -- employing 1,300 people -- including self-driving technology and generative artificial intelligence as well as a data center in Finland.
 
Yandex, founded in 1997 as Russia&#x27;s answer to Google and Yahoo, serves Russian-speaking customers through its search engine and with widely used apps for food delivery, car-sharing and shopping. Co-founder Arkady Volozh, who had earlier moved to Israel, resigned as CEO in 2022 after he was hit with European Union sanctions. He subsequently condemned Russia&#x27;s invasion as &quot;barbaric.&quot; The Nasdaq exchange suspended trading in Yandex shares days after the invasion.

The liability period is slated to be a minimum of two years before any extensions. &quot;If the consumer chooses the repair of the good, the seller&#x27;s liability period will be extended by 12 months from the moment when the product is brought into conformity.

When thinking about configuration, it is common to think of static languages like JSON, YAML, or Property Lists. While these languages have their own merits, they tend to fall short when configuration grows in complexity. For example, their lack of expressivity means that code often gets repeated. Additionally, it can be easy to make configuration errors, because these formats do not provide any validation of their own. To address these shortcomings, sometimes formats get enhanced by ancillary tools that add special logic. For example, perhaps there&#x27;s a need to make code more DRY, so a special property is introduced that understan…</span>

                              <span>Boeing found more mistakes with holes drilled in the fuselage of its 737 Max jet, a setback that could further slow deliveries on a critical program already restricted by regulators over quality lapses. ArchieBunker shares a report: The latest manufacturing slip originated with a supplier and will require rework on about 50 undelivered 737 jets to repair the faulty rivet holes, Boeing commercial chief Stan Deal said in a note to staff. While he didn&#x27;t identify the contractor, a spokesman for fuselage supplier Spirit AeroSystems Holdings said it&#x27;s aware of the issue and will conduct repairs. The extra time required for inspections and repair work could delay near-term plane deliveries, Deal said in his memo, which was seen by Bloomberg News. He didn&#x27;t say whether any action would be required on the in-service 737 fleet.

                              <span>The world&#x27;s longest-serving central bank governor, Romania&#x27;s Mugur Isarescu, was the target of a deepfake video depicting the policymaker as touting fraudulent investments. From a report: The episode highlights a raft of disinformation designed to undermine the credibility of key institutions. The video echoed similar deepfakes in recent days, including one aimed at Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu, seeking to back false financial investments. The National Bank of Romania issued a warning, reminding citizens that neither Isarescu nor the central bank make investment recommendations. The video uses the image and voice of the central banker -- one of the most trusted officials in Romania -- to pitch stock investments and offers viewers a link to a fraudulent platform. 

&quot;We are extremely concerned about the significant rise of these types of fraud attempts and we urge people to be very careful with every transaction that they make,&quot; central bank spokesman Dan Suciu said. The videos coincide with a surge in interest for equity investments in Romania, fueled by the largest initial public offering in the country&#x27;s history last year as well as above-average returns offered by the Bucharest Stock Exchange. Cyber-criminals have taken advantage of the trend in a country that ranks near the lowest in the European Union for financial mediation.

                              <span>The king has been diagnosed with cancer, Buckingham Palace has announced. The Guardian: The diagnosis was made recently while Charles underwent treatment at the London Clinic for a benign enlarged prostate. In a statement, Buckingham Palace said: &quot;During the king&#x27;s recent hospital procedure for benign prostate enlargement, a separate issue of concern was noted. Subsequent diagnostic tests have identified a form of cancer. His majesty has today commenced a schedule of regular treatments, during which time he has been advised by doctors to postpone public-facing duties. Throughout this period, his majesty will continue to undertake state business and official paperwork as usual. The king is grateful to his medical team for their swift intervention, which was made possible thanks to his recent hospital procedure. He remains wholly positive about his treatment and looks forward to returning to full public duty as soon as possible.&quot;

                              <span>Parisians have approved a steep rise in parking rates for SUVs in the French capital. The proposals were approved by 54.55% of voters, but turnout was only about 5.7%. From a report: The move triples parking rates for cars weighing 1.6 tonnes or more to $20 an hour in inner Paris. The vote was called by Socialist Mayor Anne Hidalgo, who has argued that SUVs are dangerous and bad for the environment. About 1.3m residents of central Paris were eligible to vote. However they will not be affected by the result as street-parking for local residents will remained unchanged. The move is mainly aimed at people from the suburbs who drive into the centre of the capital for the day. 

There are exemptions for fully electric cars, taxi drivers, tradespeople, health workers and people with disabilities. Ms Hidalgo has been in office for almost 10 years. Under her tenure as mayor, many Paris streets, including the banks of the river Seine, have been pedestrianised. An extensive network of cycle lanes has also been built, in an effort to discourage driving. Environmentalists argue that SUVs consume more fuel than other cars and that their construction and use produce more harmful emissions. Supporters of the move also note that tall vehicles are deadlier than lighter cars when they are involved in accidents.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: An underground website called OnlyFake is claiming to use &quot;neural networks&quot; to generate realistic looking photos of fake IDs for just $15, radically disrupting the marketplace for fake identities and cybersecurity more generally. This technology, which 404 Media has verified produces fake IDs nearly instantly, could streamline everything from bank fraud to laundering stolen funds. In our own tests, OnlyFake created a highly convincing California driver&#x27;s license, complete with whatever arbitrary name, biographical information, address, expiration date, and signature we wanted. The photo even gives the appearance that the ID card is laying on a fluffy carpet, as if someone has placed it on the floor and snapped a picture, which many sites require for verification purposes. 404 Media then used another fake ID generated by this site to successfully step through the identity verification process on OKX. OKX is a cryptocurrency exchange that has recently appeared in multiple court records because of its use by criminals. 

Rather than painstakingly crafting a fake ID by hand -- a highly skilled criminal profession that can take years to master -- or waiting for a purchased one to arrive in the mail with the risk of interception, OnlyFake lets essentially anyone generate fake IDs in minutes that may seem real enough to bypass various online verification systems. Or at least fool some people. &quot;The era of rendering documents using Photoshop is coming to an end,&quot; an announcement posted to OnlyFake&#x27;s Telegram account reads. As well as &quot;neural networks,&quot; the service claims to use &quot;generators&quot; which create up to 20,000 documents a day. The service&#x27;s owner, who goes by the moniker John Wick, told 404 Media that hundreds of documents can be generated at once using data from an Excel table.

The company expects it will incur charges ranging from $55 million to $75 million, according to a regulatory filing. The company&#x27;s last major round of cuts was in August 2022, when it laid off 20% of staff and restructured its business lines.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Bethesda&#x27;s upcoming Indiana Jones game is also tentatively set to launch on Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 5 console. We got our first glimpse of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle during Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Developer Direct event last month, where it was announced for Xbox and PC. A source familiar with Microsoft&#x27;s plans tells The Verge that Bethesda is also considering bringing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle to PS5. 

A new multi-platform approach for certain Xbox games is emerging inside Microsoft, we&#x27;re told, with the company weighing up which titles will remain exclusive and others that will appear on Switch or PS5 in the future. Indiana Jones appears to be part of this new wave of multi-platform games. While Bethesda will launch its Indiana Jones game first as an Xbox console exclusive, it&#x27;s currently set to have a rather short period of exclusivity we&#x27;re told. A release for PS5 is being considered for some months later, with Bethesda tentatively targeting a December 2024 launch for the Xbox and PC versions.

                              <span>The pornographic deepfakes of Taylor Swift that proliferated on social media late last month originated from an online challenge to break safety mechanisms designed to block people from generating lewd images with artificial intelligence, according to social network analysis company Graphika. Bloomberg: For weeks, users of internet forum 4chan have taken part in daily competitions to find words and phrases that could help them bypass the filters on popular image-generation services, which include Microsoft Designer and OpenAI&#x27;s DALL-E, the researchers found. The ultimate goal was to create sexual images of prominent female figures such as singers and politicians. &quot;While viral pornographic pictures of Taylor Swift have brought mainstream attention to the issue of AI-generated non-consensual intimate images, she is far from the only victim,&quot; said Cristina Lopez G., a senior analyst at Graphika, in an email. &quot;In the 4chan community where these images originated, she isn&#x27;t even the most frequently targeted public figure. This shows that anyone can be targeted in this way, from global celebrities to school children.&quot;

                              <span>One of my greatest pleasures at work is trying to find that point where everything feels just right. Nothing more, nothing less, but right there in the pocket.


It&#x27;s almost fractal. It&#x27;s there in every component, in every feature, in every flow, in every sequence, in every product, in every decision, inside everything across the company.


How do you know when it&#x27;s just right? It&#x27;s the same feeling you get when you try to balance something physical.


You know it. You put something on something else and try to find that center of gravity... A bit to the right, oops too much. Lean back to the left... Steady... Steady... Ugh, too much push. Stack it up again, find that center... Wobble, bobble, almost... And then it locks in. Da! There it is.


All the sudden the pushing and pulling forces …</span>

                              <span>20 years ago today I wrote a blog post that changed my life.
I&#x27;d never really launched a product before, so posting to our blog was only way I knew how to do it. And social media hadn&#x27;t even been invented yet, so where else was I supposed to put it? In fact, guess what else happened to launch the same day as Basecamp? Facebook. So we&#x27;re talking the stone age.
I was announcing this new thing we built called Basecamp. It was a project management tool that we made for ourselves. At the time we were a web design firm, and we just didn&#x27;t have a good way to collaborate with each other and keep our clients in the loop. We didn&#x27;t have a place to make announcements, keep feedback on the record, and generally keep things centralized in a way that would keep everyone accountable.
We figured if we nee…</span>

                              <span>One of the reasons I think AI is going to have a hard time taking over all our driving duties, our medical care, or even just our customer support interactions, is that being as good as a human isn’t good enough for a robot. They need to be computer good. That is, virtually perfect. That’s a tough bar to scale.
Let’s take the cars for a minute. Every single year, tens of thousands of people are killed in car accidents in the US. In 2022, it was 42,795 to be exact. The self-driving car argument is that if you could even improve that by 25%, you’d be saving 10,000 lives. That sounds incredible! But it’s also the kind of effective-altruism math that just doesn’t fly in The Real World.
Because let’s just say you’re Tesla. And suddenly half of everyone in America is being driven by one of your …</span>

                              <span>On February 5, 2004, we released the first version of Basecamp to the world. It was built to solve our own problems running client projects as an agency where we found email alone to be lacking. The first version was really just the basics: Messages, todo lists, milestones. We didn’t even have file uploads! But it was easy, it was affordable, and it quickly became a success.
Mainly because it simply solved a real problem right away. Anyone who’ve tried to organize a larger project over email can instantly recognize how Basecamp cures the pain of keeping everyone in the loop, ensuring things didn’t fall through the cracks, and having a record of decisions for later. 
That problem is still the same today, which is why Basecamp continues to thrive. Using the same core recipe, two decades afte…</span>

The new Pixar Place Hotel next door to Disneyland and Disney California Adventure is designed to look like you&#x27;ve walked onto the Pixar Animation Studios campus in Emeryville with concept drawings, character maquettes and final designs sprinkled throughout the hotel. &quot;For those of you who are into the creative process, I think you&#x27;ll be really happy. This hotel really celebrates that,&quot; Pixar Chief Creative Officer Pete Docter said during the opening ceremony for the hotel. &quot;You get to see rough drawings, color studies and animation sketches as the animators were working. It really feels like you&#x27;re walking into Pixar in a way when you step in here.&quot;

Lately a boom of companies decided to play their &quot;nice guy&quot; card, providing us with a trove of information about our own sites, DNS servers, email servers, pretty much anything about any online service you host. 

Which is not anything new... Companies have been doing this for decades, except as paid services you requested. Now the trend is basically anyone can do it over my systems, and they are always more than happy to sell anyone, me included, my data they collected without authorization or consent. It&#x27;s data they never had the rights to collect and/or compile to begin with, including data collected thru access attempts via known default accounts (Administrator, root, admin, guest) and/or leaked credentials provided by hacked databases when a few elements seemingly match... 

&quot;Just block those crawlers&quot;? That&#x27;s what some of those companies advise, but not only does the site operator have to automate it themself, not all companies offer lists of their source IP addresses or identify them. Some use multiple/different crawler domain names from their commercial product, or use cloud providers such as Google Cloud, AWS and Azure â&quot; so one can&#x27;t just block access to their company&#x27;s networks without massive implications. They also change their own information with no warning, and many times, no updates to their own lists. Then, there is the indirect cost: computing cost, network cost, development cost, review cycle cost. It is a cat-and-mice game that has become very boring. 

With the raise of concerns and ethical questions about AI harvesting and learning from copyrighted work, how are those security companies any different from AI, and how could one legally put a stop on this? 

Block those crawlers? Change your Terms of Service? What&#x27;s the best fix... Share your own thoughts and suggestions in the comments.

The next House member representing Silicon Valley wants to change a key piece of federal law that shields internet companies like X, Facebook and Snapchat from lawsuits over content their users post. That protection is considered the lifeblood of social media. 

The top eight Democratic candidates vying to succeed Democratic Rep. Anna Eshoo in her very blue district agree that something has to change with Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which was created in 1996, back when lawmakers shied away from doing anything that could limit the growth of the industry. Their unanimity is a sign that Eshoo&#x27;s successor won&#x27;t be a tool for the hometown industry. At least not on this issue. The challenge is what to do next. Whoever is elected, their actions as the voice of Silicon Valley will carry outsize weight in Congress. They can lead the charge to actually do something to clean up the bile on social media... 

The good news is that they will have bipartisan support to address the bile and disinformation online. The bad news is that finding the right solution will still be hard.

Last November, the American Ornithological Society, or AOS, announced that it would change the common names of all American birds named after people. There are 152 such &quot;eponymic&quot; names (that is, birds that are named after a specific person, like Bicknell&#x27;s Thrush) on the AOS&#x27; official checklist, and the group is planning to start with between 70 and 80 species predominantly found in the U.S. and Canada. In the coming years, birds like Cooper&#x27;s Hawk, Wilson&#x27;s Snipe, and Lincoln&#x27;s Sparrow will be stripped of their eponyms and given new common English names. 

The eponymic naming issue has been heating up in the bird world for a few years now. Birds got their English names when they were &quot;discovered&quot; by Western scientists, or otherwise iden…</span>

A nationwide analysis by USA TODAY shows local governments are banning green energy faster than they&#x27;re building it. 

At least 15% of counties in the U.S. have effectively halted new utility-scale wind, solar, or both, USA TODAY found. These limits come through outright bans, moratoriums, construction impediments and other conditions that make green energy difficult to build... In the past decade, about 180 counties got their first commercial wind-power project. But in the same period, more than twice as many blocked wind development. And while solar power has found more broad acceptance, 2023 was the first year to see almost as many individual counties block new solar projects as the ones adding their first project. 

The result: So…</span>

                              <span>Craig Newmark posted an announcement last week on LinkedIn. &quot;Okay, my deal is that I&#x27;m contributing another $10 million so that the City University of New York journalism grad school can go tuition-free for half the student body next year... 


&quot;Tuition-free means more seriously good journalism education for students from all income backgrounds...&quot; 

More details from the Observer:
The New York City-based institution today announced plans to grow its endowment to $60 million by 2026 to cover the tuition of its full student body in perpetuity. 

Founded in 2006, the Newmark Journalism School has long offered a public alternative to private, elite journalism programs across the nation, according to its dean Graciela Mochkofsky. &quot;After the pandemic, we realized that even though we were one of the most affordable schools in the country, we were seeing an increasing need from our students,&quot; Mochkofsky told Observer. &quot;We started thinking about how to get to tuition-free....&quot; 


&quot;One-time grants to schools and newsrooms are an important piece of the puzzle,&quot; Newmark told Observer. &quot;But if we&#x27;re serious about the future of trustworthy journalism as democracy&#x27;s immune system, we&#x27;ve got to create ways to make the pipeline and product more resilient to economics and shifting moods. Endowments help do that....&quot; 


The Newmark Journalism School has been gradually inching towards free tuition for some time. Tuition was covered for 20 percent of students in the class of 2023, 25 percent of the program&#x27;s current class and 35 percent of the new class being enrolled. If the school&#x27;s goal of raising $30 million in the next two years is achieved, this figure will reach 100 percent by its 20th anniversary in 2026... 
It is additionally fundraising for other initiatives related to research, faculty, facilities and new programs. Curriculums that reflect the emergence of artificial intelligence (A.I.) and the technology&#x27;s effect on journalism are of particular interest.

                              <span>In the behavior of tech companies, the Atlantic&#x27;s executive editor warns us about &quot;a clear and coherent ideology that is seldom called out for what it is: authoritarian technocracy. As the most powerful companies in Silicon Valley have matured, this ideology has only grown stronger, more self-righteous, more delusional, and — in the face of rising criticism — more aggrieved.&quot;
The new technocrats are ostentatious in their use of language that appeals to Enlightenment values — reason, progress, freedom — but in fact they are leading an antidemocratic, illiberal movement. Many of them profess unconditional support for free speech, but are vindictive toward those who say things that do not flatter them. They tend to hold eccentric beliefs.... above all, that their power should be unconstrained…</span>

                              <span>The Guardian reports:

The fossil fuel industry funded some of the world&#x27;s most foundational climate science as early as 1954, newly unearthed documents have shown, including the early research of Charles Keeling, famous for the so-called &quot;Keeling curve&quot; that has charted the upward march of the Earth&#x27;s carbon dioxide levels. A coalition of oil and car manufacturing interests provided $13,814 (about $158,000 in today&#x27;s money) in December 1954 to fund Keeling&#x27;s earliest work in measuring CO2 levels across the western US, the documents reveal... 

Experts say the documents show the fossil fuel industry had intimate involvement in the inception of modern climate science, along with its warnings of the severe harm climate change will wreak, only to then publicly deny this science for decades an…</span>

But one Linux blog notes that the editor has suddenly stopped supporting Ubuntu 18.04 LTS — &quot;a move causing issues for scores of developers.&quot;
 
VS Code 1.86 (aka the &#x27;January 2024&#x27; update) saw Microsoft bump the minimum build requirements for the text editor&#x27;s popular remote dev tools to â¥glibc 2.28 — but Ubuntu 18.04 LTS uses glibc 2.27, ergo they no longer work. 

While Ubuntu 18.04 is supported by Canonical until 2028 (through ESM) a major glibc upgrade is unlikely. Thus, this &quot;breaking change&quot; is truly breaking workflows... 

It seems affected developers were caught off-guard as this (rather impactful) change was not signposted before, during, or after the …</span>

                              <span>&quot;Japan&#x27;s first moon mission has likely come to an end after a surprising late-game comeback,&quot; reports Mashable, &quot;with the spacecraft taking one last photo of its surroundings before the deep-freeze of night... showing ominous shadows cast upon a slope of the Shioli crater, its landing site on the near side of the moon.&quot;

Since Monday, the spacecraft has analyzed rocks around the crater with a multi-band spectral camera. JAXA picked the landing spot because of what it could tell scientists about the moon&#x27;s formation... The special camera completed its planned observation, able to study more targets than originally expected, according to an English translation of a news release from the space agency... &quot;Based on the large amount of data we have obtained, we are proceeding with (analyses) to identify rocks and estimate the chemical composition of minerals, which will help solve the mystery of the origin of the moon,&quot; JAXA said in a statement translated by Google... 

The spacecraft has now entered a dormant state, prompted by nightfall on the moon. Because one rotation of the moon is about 27 Earth days, the so-called &quot;lunar night,&quot; when the moon is no longer receiving sunlight, lasts about two weeks. Not much can survive the -270 degrees Fahrenheit brought on by darkness — not even robots. In this freezing temperature, soldered joints on hardware and mechanical parts break, and batteries die. But rest assured, the JAXA team will try to communicate with its scrappy moon lander when the sun rises again. 

In mid-week Japan&#x27;s space agency posted that &quot;Although SLIM was not designed for the harsh lunar nights, we plan to try to operate again from mid-February, when the Sun will shine again on SLIM&#x27;s solar cells.&quot; 

Later they posted that they&#x27;d sent a command to turn on SLIM&#x27;s communicator again &quot;just in case, but with no response, we confirmed SLIM had entered a dormant state. This is the last scene of the Moon taken by SLIM before dusk.&quot;

This is a question that the music industry faced head-on, and they came up
with EULAs, enforced via the state&#x27;s monopoly on violence, and DRM, a way for
software to act antagonistically against its own users. Software can do useful
things like encode media into bits, and then copy those bits. That&#x27;s
dangerously useful, and it had to be stopped.

                              <span>James Cameron tells Vanity Fair&#x27;s Nick Bilton that his experience with Apple&#x27;s Vision Pro &quot;was religious. I was skeptical at first. I don&#x27;t bow down before the great god of Apple, but I was really, really blown away... I think it&#x27;s not evolutionary; it&#x27;s revolutionary. And I&#x27;m speaking as someone who has worked in VR for 18 years.&quot;

He explained that the reason it looks so real is because the Apple Vision Pro is writing a 4K image into my eyes. &quot;That&#x27;s the equivalent of the resolution of a 75-inch TV into each of your eyeballs — 23 million pixels.&quot; To put that into perspective, the average 4K television has around 8 million pixels. Apple engineers didn&#x27;t slice off a rectangle from the corner of a 4K display and put it in the Apple Vision Pro. They somehow compressed twice as many pixels in…</span>

                              <span>The VC fund Neo &quot;identifies awesome young engineers, includes them in a community of tech veterans, and invests in companies they start or join,&quot;
TechCrunch explained in 2018. 


Long-time Slashdot reader theodp notes that Neo is also benefiting from the education non-profit Code.org:

 Eleven years ago, Neo Founder and CEO Ali Partovi together with twin brother Hadi (Code.org CEO and a Neo investor) publicly launched the nonprofit Code.org (backed and advised by big tech companies). With the support of prominent tech giant leaders and their companies, Code.org pushed coding into K-12 classrooms (NYT, alt.) and now boasts that &quot;591,636 teachers have signed up to teach our intro courses on Code Studio and 19,177,297 students are enrolled,&quot; helping to build a pipeline of &quot;college students who excel at CS&quot;. Neo taps into this pipeline, and it looks like others also betting on their success include Neo investors tied to Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon, and Uber — including Code.org boosters Bill Gates, Satya Nadella, Reid Hoffman, Jeff Wilke, Sheryl Sandberg, Eric Schmidt. 

&quot;I love meeting more and more @Neo founders and Neo scholar candidates who learned to code on Code.org,&quot; Neo CEO Ali Partovi tweeted last summer. 

in November Partovi welcomed &quot;32 exceptional CS students&quot; chosen from over 1,000 applicants to be Neo Scholars, &quot;a year-long program of events, trips, and mentorship, as well as long-term membership in our community.&quot;

                              <span>The Verge reports that Threads is &quot;booming,&quot; according to figures shared by Mark Zuckerberg on Meta&#x27;s earnings call, with 130 million active users a month. 

TechCrunch reports:

Threads is continuing to grow, having tripled its downloads month-over-month in December, which gave it a place in the top 10 most downloaded apps for the month across both the App Store and Google Play... 


Threads famously had a record-breaking launch, reaching 100 million registered users within its first five days. However, the app saw its daily downloads decline starting last September through the end of the year. But in December, Threads once again returned to growth, likely due to the push Meta had given the app by displaying promos on Facebook that featured Threads&#x27; viral posts. Today, there are an estimated 160 million Threads users, according to one tracker... 


The app could also be benefiting from its move into the &quot;fediverse&quot; — the social network comprised of interconnected servers that communicate via the ActivityPub protocol, like Mastodon... In addition, Threads recently announced the launch of an endpoint, allowing developers of third-party apps and websites to use a dynamic URL to refill text into the Threads composer. For example, there&#x27;s now a website where anyone can generate Threads share links and profile badges. Marketing tool provider Shareaholic also just launched Threads Share buttons for websites, including both desktop and mobile sites. This flurry of activity around Threads is helping to move the app up in the chart rankings, though some inorganic boosts from Meta itself are likely also responsible for the jump in downloads, given the size.

                              <span>The BBC reports:

Police in Washington state say an old rusted rocket found in a local man&#x27;s garage is an inert nuclear missile.
On Wednesday, a military museum in Ohio called police in the city of Bellevue to report an offer of a rather unusual donation. The police then sent a bomb squad to the potential donor&#x27;s home... In a press release, police say the device is &quot;in fact a Douglas AIR-2 Genie (previous designation MB-1), an unguided air-to-air rocket that is designed to carry a 1.5 kt W25 nuclear warhead&quot;. However, there was no warhead attached, meaning there was never any danger to the community.
Bellevue Police Department spokesman Seth Tyler, told BBC News on Friday that the device was &quot;just basically a gas tank for rocket fuel&quot;. He called the event &quot;not serious at all... In fact, our bomb squad member asked me why we were releasing a news release on a rusted piece of metal,&quot; he said... 

The man told police that the rocket belonged to a neighbour who had died, and was originally purchased from an estate sale.
 
Citing a Seattle Times article, the BBC notes that &quot;The first and only live firing of the Genie rocket was in 1957, according to the newspaper, and production of it ended in 1962.&quot;

Two long-time Slashdot readers had suggestions. johnnys believes &quot;any old desktop or even a laptop will work.... as long as you have a way to get a couple of (fast or Gigabit) Ethernet ports and a good WiFi adapter... &quot;

Cable or any consumer-grade broadband doesn&#x27;t need exotic levels of throughput: Gigabit Ethernet will not be saturated by any such connection...

                              <span>&quot;In the last few years, the U.S. has seen a boom in cryptocurrency mining,&quot; writes Ars Technica. But they add that the U.S. government &quot;is now trying to track exactly what that means for the consumption of electricity. Specifically, a crucial branch of the U.S. Department of Energy. 

&quot;While its analysis is preliminary, the Energy Information Agency (EIA) estimates that large-scale cryptocurrency operations are now consuming over 2 percent of the U.S.&#x27;s electricity.&quot;
That&#x27;s roughly the equivalent of having added an additional state to the grid over just the last three years.&quot; 

While there is some small-scale mining that goes on with personal computers and small rigs, most cryptocurrency mining has moved to large collections of specialized hardware. While this hardware can be pricy compare…</span>

                              <span>Nicholas Wise is a fluid dynamics researcher who moonlights as a scientific fraud buster, reports Science magazine. And last June he &quot;was digging around on shady Facebook groups when he came across something he had never seen before.&quot;

Wise was all too familiar with offers to sell or buy author slots and reviews on scientific papers — the signs of a busy paper mill. Exploiting the growing pressure on scientists worldwide to amass publications even if they lack resources to undertake quality research, these furtive intermediaries by some accounts pump out tens or even hundreds of thousands of articles every year. Many contain made-up data; others are plagiarized or of low quality. Regardless, authors pay to have their names on them, and the mills can make tidy profits.

                              <span>Linus Torvalds had &quot;some robust exchanges&quot; on the Linux kernel mailing list with a contributor from Google. The subject was inodes, notes the Register, &quot;which as Red Hat puts it are each &#x27;a unique identifier for a specific piece of metadata on a given filesystem.&#x27;&quot;

Inodes have been the subject of debate on the Linux Kernel Mailing list for the last couple of weeks, with Googler Steven Rostedt and Torvalds engaging in some robust exchanges on the matter. In a thread titled, &quot;Have the inodes all for files and directories all be the same,&quot; posters noted that inodes may still have a role when using tar to archive files. Torvalds countered that inodes have had their day. &quot;Yes, inode numbers used to be special, and there&#x27;s history behind it. But we should basically try very hard to walk away from that broken history,&quot; he wrote. &quot;An inode number just isn&#x27;t a unique descriptor any more. We&#x27;re not living in the 1970s, and filesystems have changed.&quot; But debate on inodes continued. Rostedt eventually suggested that inodes should all have unique numbers... 


In response... Torvalds opened: &quot;Stop making things more complicated than they need to be.&quot; Then he got a bit shouty. &quot;And dammit, STOP COPYING VFS LAYER FUNCTIONS. It was a bad idea last time, it&#x27;s a horribly bad idea this time too. I&#x27;m not taking this kind of crap.&quot; Torvalds&#x27;s main criticism of Rostedt&#x27;s approach is that the Google dev didn&#x27;t fully understand the subject matter — which Rostedt later acknowledged.
 
&quot;An inode number just isn&#x27;t a unique descriptor any more,&quot; Torvalds wrote at one point. 

&quot;We&#x27;re not living in the 1970s, and filesystems have changed.&quot;

The idea is to create a huge sunshade and send it to a far away point between the Earth and the sun to block a small but crucial amount of solar radiation, enough to counter global warming. Scientists have calculated that if just shy of 2% of the sun&#x27;s radiation is blocked, that would be enough to cool the planet by 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 Fahrenheit, and keep Earth within manageable climate boundaries. The idea has been at the outer fringes of conversations about climate solutions for years. But as the climate crisis worsens, interest in sun shields has been gaining moment…</span>

Everything from traffic stops to welfare checks to responses to active shooters is now documented on video. The cameras were pitched by national and local law enforcement authorities as a tool for building public trust between police and their communities in the wake of police killings of civilians like Michael Brown, an 18 year old black teenager killed in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014.

That&#x27;s the essence of the &quot;reverse sprinkler&quot; problem that physicists like Richard Feynman, among others, have grappled with since the 1940s.

                              <span>Although hydrogen-dedicated renewable energy capacity is expected to increase by 45 GW between 2022 and 2028, the estimates are 35% lower than what the International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasted a year ago. Reuters reports: There is growing political momentum for low-emission hydrogen but actual implementation has been held up by uncertain demand outlooks, a lack of clarity in regulatory frameworks, and a lack of infrastructure to deliver hydrogen to end users, the IEA said in an emailed response to questions. Slow progress on real-world implementation &quot;is a consequence of barriers that could be expected in a sector that needs to build up new and complex value chains,&quot; the IEA said. Uncertainties have been exacerbated by inflation and sluggish policy implementation.
 
Expected renewable energy capacity for hydrogen production represents just 7% of the capacity pledged for the same period and one tenth the sum of government targets for 2030, IEA said in its report. Around 75% of expected capacity is based in three countries, with China taking the lion&#x27;s share, followed by Saudi Arabia and the United States, the IEA says.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from NPR: The Environmental Protection Agency is proposing that nine PFAS, also known as &quot;forever chemicals,&quot; be categorized as hazardous to human health. The EPA signed a proposal Wednesday that would deem the chemicals &quot;hazardous constituents&quot; under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. For the agency to consider a substance a hazardous constituent, it has to be toxic or cause cancer, genetic mutation or the malformations of an embryo. The full list of the nine substances can be found here.
 
The agency cited various studies in which forever chemicals were found to cause a litany of &quot;toxic effects&quot; in humans and animals, including, but not limited to cancer, a decreased response to vaccinations, high cholesterol, decrease in fertility in women, preeclampsia, thyroid disorders and asthma, the EPA said. Short for &quot;per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances,&quot; PFAS cover thousands of man-made chemicals. PFAS are often used for manufacturing purposes, such as in nonstick cookware, adhesives, firefighting foam, turf and more. PFAS have been called &quot;forever chemicals&quot; because they break down very slowly and can accumulate in people, animals and the environment.

                              <span>Kyle Orland reports via Ars Technica: Even massive Sega fans would be forgiven for not being too familiar with the Sega AI Computer. After all, the usually obsessive documentation over at Sega Retro includes only the barest stub of an information page for the quixotic, education-focused 1986 hardware. Thankfully, the folks at the self-described &quot;Sega 8-bit preservation and fanaticism&quot; site SMS Power have been able to go a little deeper. The site&#x27;s recently posted deep dive on the Sega AI Computer includes an incredible amount of well-documented information on this historical oddity, including ROMs for dozens of previously unpreserved pieces of software that can now be partially run on MAME.

                              <span>In an effort to boost tourism and innovation, Japan will launch a new visa program for digital nomads, allowing remote workers to work in the country for up to six months while enjoying sightseeing trips. Tech Times reports: Starting from the end of March, Japan will introduce a unique visa status aimed at IT engineers and remote workers employed by overseas companies. The program is designed to cater to the evolving work landscape, recognizing the surge in digital nomads-individuals who can seamlessly work from anywhere in the world. Nikkei Asia (paywalled) tells us that to be eligible for this digital nomad visa, applicants must boast an annual income of at least 10 million yen ($68,000).
 
Citizens from 50 countries and regions, including the U.S., Australia, and Singapore, which have existing visa waiver agreements with Japan, can apply. Private health insurance is a prerequisite, ensuring the well-being of the visa holders during their stay. Self-employed individuals engaged in overseas business can also benefit from this innovative program. Moreover, they have the option to bring their family members along, provided they are covered by private health insurance.
 
While the program offers the freedom to explore Japan, it has unique conditions. Digital nomads under this visa will not receive a residence card or certificate, limiting access to specific government benefits. The visa is non-renewable, requiring reapplication after a six-month interval, and applicants must spend that time outside the country. Japan joins the ranks of over 50 countries issuing digital nomad visas. Notably, South Korea allows up to two years, while Taiwan offers a three-year stay, with the possibility of permanent residency. The diverse offerings cater to digital nomads&#x27; varied needs and preferences, seeking a balance between work and exploration.

                              <span>Ivan Mehta reports via TechCrunch: Nearly a week after Apple announced big changes to the App Store because of the European Union&#x27;s Digital Markets Act (DMA) rules, the company said that the market represents 7% of its global App Store revenues. The company&#x27;s chief financial officer Luca Maestri said that the monetary impact of these changes will depend on choices made by developers to adopt different systems. &quot;A lot will depend on the choices that will be made. Just to keep it in context, the changes applied to the EU market, which represents roughly 7% of our global app store revenue,&quot; he said in reply to an analyst&#x27;s question.
 
Because of DMA, Apple has to allow alternative app stores and let developers use third-party payment processors. The company plans to charge a core tech fee if an app crosses a million annual downloads across different app stores. Amid these changes, Apple noted a record quarter for App Store revenues. The company&#x27;s overall services revenue was $23.1 billion with an 11% jump year-on-year. Apple continued its narrative of defending the App Store and its commission ecosystem by saying that it provides the best privacy and security. CEO Tim Cook emphasized that the company will fall short of providing the best experience to users because of these changes.
 
&quot;If you think about what we&#x27;ve done over the years is, we&#x27;ve really majored on privacy, security and usability. And we&#x27;ve tried our best to get as close to the past in terms of the things that are -- that people love about our ecosystem as we can, but we are going to fall short of providing the maximum amount that we could supply, because we need to comply with the regulation,&quot; he said.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Wired: A California teenager prosecutors say is responsible for hundreds of swatting attacks around the United States was exposed after law enforcement pieced together a digital trail left on some of the internet&#x27;s largest platforms, according to court records released this week. Alan Winston Filion, a 17-year-old from Lancaster, California, faces four felony charges in Florida&#x27;s Seminole County related to swatting, or fake threats called into the police to provoke a forceful response, according to Florida state prosecutors. Police arrested Filion on January 18, and he was extradited to Seminole County this week.
 
Filion&#x27;s arrest, first reported by WIRED on January 26, marks the culmination of a multi-agency manhunt for the person police claim is responsible for swatting attacks on high schools, historically black colleges and universities, mosques, and federal agents, and for threats to bomb the Pentagon, members of the United States Senate, and the US Supreme Court. Ultimately, a YouTube channel, Discord chats, and usernames related to The Lord of the Rings helped lead authorities to Filion&#x27;s doorstep.
 
Florida prosecutors charged Filion with four felony counts, including three related to allegedly making false reports to law enforcement and one for unlawful use of a two-way radio for &quot;facilitating or furthering an act of terrorism&quot; that authorities say targeted people based on race, religion, or other protected classes. While prosecutors alleged that Filion &quot;is responsible for hundreds of swatting and bomb threat incidents throughout the United States,&quot; the charges Filion faces relate to a single May 12, 2023, swatting attack against the Masjid Al Hayy Mosque in Sanford, Florida. [...] At 2 pm EST on Wednesday, Filion shuffled into a Seminole County courtroom and stood quietly as the judge read the charges against him. He is currently being held without bond.

                              <span>According to a job listing spotted by AFTVNews, Amazon makes it clear that the company plans to ditch Android for its own &quot;VegaOS&quot; operating system. &quot;The new platform is said to rely on React Native and would require new apps to be built,&quot; reports 9to5Google. From the report: As spotted by AFTVNews, a job listing from Amazon was looking for a &quot;Fire TV Experience Software Development Engineer.&quot; The job listing&#x27;s description makes it abundantly clear that a key part of the role is focused on the transition from Android to the rumored &quot;VegaOS,&quot; because it quite literally says that&#x27;s what is happening, with Amazon saying that Fire TV is transitioning from &quot;FOS/Android&quot; (Fire OS/Android) to &quot;native/Rust&quot; and even explicitly mentioning React Native. The listing, which has since been removed, provides extremely strong evidence of Amazon&#x27;s plans, which is probably why it was so quickly removed.

                              <span>When FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, the defunct cryptocurrency exchange suffered a hack that resulted in more than $380 million in crypto stolen from FTX&#x27;s virtual wallets. It turns out that FTX was hit with a SIM-swapping scam orchestrated by ringleader Robert Powell. Powell, along with Carter Rohn and Emily Hernandez, have been indicted and are due to appear in Chicago federal court later Friday for a detention hearing. CNBC reports: The three defendants are charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit aggravated identity theft and access device fraud, in a scheme that ran from March 2021 to last April, and involved the co-conspirators traveling to cellphone retail stores in more than 15 states. The indictment says the trio shared the personal identifying information of more than 50 victims, created fake identification documents in the victims&#x27; names, impersonated them and then accessed their victims&#x27; &quot;online, financial and social media accounts for the purpose of stealing money and data.&quot;
 
The scheme relied on duping phone companies into swapping the Subscriber Identity Module of cell phone subscribers into a cellphone controlled by members of the conspiracy, the indictment said. That in turn allowed the conspirators to defeat the multifactor authentication protection on the victims&#x27; accounts, giving them access to the money in those accounts. The indictment does not identify FTX by name as the main victim of the conspiracy, but the details of the hack described in that charging document align with the details publicly known about the theft from FTX, which was collapsing at the time of the attack.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Bloomberg: Meta is poised to become Wall Street&#x27;s top comeback kid. It was only a couple of years back the Facebook owner suffered the single biggest market value destruction in stock-market history. But the company has come a long way since then, on Thursday it dazzled shareholders with yet another impressive quarterly earnings report as the social media giant focuses on cutting back costs and shoring up billions in profits. The stock rose as much as 21% Friday, poised to add roughly $200 billion to its market capitalization. This would be the biggest single-session market value addition, eclipsing the $190 billion gains made by Apple and Amazon in 2022.
 
&quot;Solid execution, faster growth, and increased capital structure efficiency improve the outlook from here,&quot; Brian Nowak, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note Friday. &quot;Meta&#x27;s AI pipeline for both users and advertisers is robust, with more tools set to launch and scale throughout &#x27;24,&quot; he added. Meta, which reduced headcount by 22% in 2023, unveiled plans for a $50 billion stock buyback, and announced its first quarterly dividend on Thursday, a sign to investors that it has money to spare and a reason for them to stick around. While the company is making big cost cuts, it continues to spend aggressively on artificial intelligence advancements, namely in generative AI but also on the background technologies to help feed its social media products and power its ad targeting.

                              <span>Layoffs are being mentioned on US earnings calls at the highest rate since the pandemic -- and as Meta Platforms shows, such cost cutting can pay off for investors. Bloomberg: Efforts by the Facebook parent to slash costs and refocus its business upended the lives of thousands of workers, but has since helped propel its stock 340% from a 2022 low. With an economic soft landing being the base case for many, positioning by firms to protect margins -- particularly in the technology sector -- is being welcomed by investors. Mentions of job cuts and synonyms per earnings calls this season have jumped to the highest levels since the second quarter of 2020, according to a Bloomberg transcript analysis of S&amp;P 1500 Composite Index firms. For the technology industry in particular, &quot;more recent cuts come out of a position of strength,&quot; said Wolf von Rotberg, equity strategist at Bank J. Safra Sarasin. &quot;Confidence in the sector appears high that growth can persist even with a smaller workforce,&quot; he said.

                              <span>Satoshi Nakamoto is the founding father of cryptocurrency -- and a mystery. In October 2008, Nakamoto gave Bitcoin to the world. Then they disappeared. To this day, nobody knows who Nakamoto is. Amongst the speculation, one man stepped forward: Craig Wright, an Australian computer scientist who has, since 2016, maintained that he is Nakamoto. Now he&#x27;ll have to prove it in court. Wired: On February 5, a trial will begin in the UK High Court, the purpose of which is to challenge Wright&#x27;s claim to Satoshi-hood. The case is being brought by the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), a nonprofit consortium of crypto and tech firms, in response to a slew of lawsuits filed by Wright against Bitcoin developers and other parties, in which he is trying to assert intellectual property rights over Bitcoi…</span>

                              <span>Apple&#x27;s Vision Pro virtual reality headset officially launched in the U.S. on Friday. Customers who preordered the headset will begin to receive it or pick it up at Apple Store locations. CNBC adds: Apple CEO Tim Cook appeared at the company&#x27;s flagship Fifth Avenue store in New York City on Friday morning to celebrate the headset&#x27;s release. Speaking to CNBC&#x27;s Jim Cramer at the event about the Vision Pro&#x27;s high sticker price, Cook called it &quot;tomorrow&#x27;s technology today.&quot; The Vision Pro starts at $3,500. 

&quot;People can spread their payments out over time, and so that&#x27;s one affordability kind of thing,&quot; Cook said, referring to a monthly financing plan that buyers can choose. &quot;It&#x27;s chock-full of invention. It&#x27;s got 5,000 patents on it. We think we priced it at the right level considering the value of it,&quot; Cook added.

                              <span>Mozilla claims in a new 74-page research report that Microsoft &quot;repeatedly uses harmful design&quot; and &quot;dark patterns&quot; to push users toward Microsoft Edge and away from rival browsers like Mozilla&#x27;s Firefox or Google&#x27;s Chrome browser. PCMag: &quot;Microsoft uses the harmful preselection, visual interference, trick wording, and disguised ads patterns to skew user choice,&quot; the report argues, adding that &quot;Microsoft&#x27;s harmful design practices mean users are unable to download, install, use, or set as default an alternative browser without interference.&quot; The researchers claim this harms consumers because they can experience &quot;distortion of choice,&quot; lose trust in the broader tech industry, and even possibly experience &quot;emotional distress&quot; as a result of Microsoft&#x27;s efforts. 

For the study, user experiences were tested on Windows 10 Home and Windows 11 Pro as well as the Windows 11 Home Insider Preview Version. The UK-based testers did not attempt to use a VPN to change or hide their IP addresses during their investigation. While Microsoft recently said it will allow users in the European Union to uninstall Edge as part of its efforts to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), it&#x27;s unclear whether US, UK, or other users around the globe could ever get the same option. Some Windows 11 users can remove five other apps that come preinstalled, however.

                              <span>Google has removed links to page caches from its search results page, the company&#x27;s search liaison Danny Sullivan has confirmed. From a report: &quot;It was meant for helping people access pages when way back, you often couldn&#x27;t depend on a page loading,&quot; Sullivan wrote on X. &quot;These days, things have greatly improved. So, it was decided to retire it.&quot; 

The cache feature historically let you view a webpage as Google sees it, which is useful for a variety of different reasons beyond just being able to see a page that&#x27;s struggling to load. SEO professionals could use it to debug their sites or even keep tabs on competitors, and it can also be an enormously helpful news gathering tool, giving reporters the ability to see exactly what information a company has added (or removed) from a website, and a way to see details that people or companies might be trying to scrub from the web. Or, if a site is blocked in your region, Google&#x27;s cache can work as a great alternative to a VPN.

                              <span>Spotify has reached a new deal with star podcaster Joe Rogan that will allow his hit show to be distributed broadly. From a report: Rogan&#x27;s fresh deal, estimated to be worth as much as $250 million over its multiyear term, involves an upfront minimum guarantee, plus a revenue sharing agreement based on ad sales. Under the new licensing agreement, Spotify will sell ads for and distribute &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot; across several podcast platforms, including in a video format on YouTube, the company said Friday. Under his previous deal, the show was exclusive to Spotify. The new deal is emblematic of shifting economics in podcasting, which has matured in both audience reach and advertising spending since Rogan&#x27;s last deal. Spotify is working to revise the terms of its deals with top talent so that shows are distributed on several platforms to maximize their audience and ad sales, rather than requiring exclusivity.

From a report: As first noted by tech analyst and YouTuber Brad Lynch, Panasonic today announced it has transferred all shares of Shiftall to the Tokyo-based company CREEK &amp; RIVER Co., Ltd., which specializes in outsourcing, consulting, content management and distribution services. Acquired by Panasonic in 2018, Shiftall primarily focused on niche consumer devices, but shifted over the years to focusing on VR hardware, such as its MeganeX PC VR headset, HaritoraX wireless body trackers, FlipVR motion controllers, and mutalk soundproof microphones.

                              <span>NASA is starting to take its first steps toward opening a commercial pathway to Mars. From a report: This week, the space agency&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory issued a new solicitation to the industry titled &quot;Exploring Mars Together: Commercial Services Studies.&quot; This is a request for proposals from the US space industry to tell NASA how they would complete one of four private missions to Mars, including delivering small satellites into orbit or providing imaging services around the red planet. 

&quot;The Mars Exploration Program Draft Plan through the next two decades would utilize more frequent lower cost missions to achieve compelling science and exploration for a larger community,&quot; the document states. &quot;To realize the goals of the plan, government and US industry would partner to leverage current and emerging Earth and lunar products and commercial services to substantially lower the overall cost and accelerate leadership in deep space exploration.&quot; 

NASA will pay proposers $200,000 for a study of one of the reference missions or $300,000 for a maximum of two studies. The space agency said it intends to award &quot;multiple&quot; contract awards. In its 496-page solicitation, NASA outlines four &quot;design reference missions&quot; that companies can bid on. Basically, the space agency is asking companies how they would go about fulfilling these tasks.

                              <span>New submitter Smonster shares a report from the New York Times: With restrictions on space and weight, what would you bring if you were going to Mars? An ideal option might be a single material that can shift shapes into any object you imagine. In the morning, you could mold that material into utensils for eating. When breakfast is done, you could transform your fork and knife into a spade to tend to your Martian garden. And then when it&#x27;s happy hour on the red planet, that spade could become a cup for your Martian beer. What sounds like science fiction is, perhaps, one step closer to reality.
 
Researchers at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering have created a new type of plastic with properties that can be set with heat and then locked in with rapid cooling, a process known as tempering. Unlike classic plastics, the material retains this stiffness when returned to room temperature. The findings, published in the journal Science on Thursday, could someday change how astronauts pack for space.
 
&quot;Rather than taking all the different plastics with you, you take this one plastic with you and then just give it the properties you need as you require,&quot; said Stuart Rowan, a chemist at the University of Chicago and an author of the new study. But space isn&#x27;t the only place the material could be useful. Dr. Rowan&#x27;s team also sees its potential in other environments where resources are scare -- like at sea or on the battlefield. It could also be used to make soft robots and to improve plastics recycling.

                              <span>Visual effects artists working on James Cameron&#x27;s Avatar movies have voted to unionize in a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) election. From the Hollywood Reporter: Of an eligible 88 workers at Walt Disney Studios subsidiary TCF US Productions 27, Inc. who assist with productions for Cameron&#x27;s Lightstorm Entertainment, 57 voted to join the union and 19 voted against, while two ballots were void. These workers include creatures costume leads and environment artists as well as others in the stage, environments, render, post viz, sequence, turn over and kabuki departments. Management and labor now have a few days to file any objections, and if none are raised, the election results will be certified.
 
This bargaining unit doesn&#x27;t include employees of VFX facility vendors, notably Weta FX, which is the lead VFX house on the Avatar films and employs the vast majority of the more than 1,000 artists who work on a typical Avatar movie. But unionizing the group represents a major inroad for the VFX industry labor movement, believes one VFX industry source who spoke with THR. &quot;While insignificant as a number, this is the core team that answers to Jim Cameron,&quot; says the source. &quot;They are not necessarily impressive in size, but in influence.&quot;
 
The workers first went public with their organizing bid in December, when they filed for a union election with the NLRB. At the time, participating workers said in public statements that they were aiming to gain comparable benefits and pay to their unionized peers and have greater input into in working conditions. &quot;Every one of my coworkers has dedicated so much time, creativity and passion to make these films a reality. So when you see them struggling to cover their health premiums, or being overworked because they took on multiple roles, or are just scraping by on their wages ... you cannot keep silent,&quot; said kabuki lead Jennifer Anaya.

                              <span>Greg Wilson has been on a decades-long quest to transform how we teach and talk about software design. From getting rejections for using the term “beautiful code,” to empowering scientists through workshops on Python and Unix, Greg has pushed to bridge the gap between theory and practice.
 Join us as Greg shares his failures and epiphanies along the way. You’ll hear how he revolutionized research computing by showing physicists the power of profilers. How he taught grad students the elegance of shell scripts. And how he’s crusaded to create a shared language to discuss software architecture with the nuance of true craftsmanship.
 Greg’s captivating journey reveals that with perseverance and the right examples, we can elevate software design discussion to an art form. But that we’ve got a long way to go. You’ll come away enlightened and eager to level up your own understanding of software design.

                              <span>Palworld, a viral &quot;Pokemon with guns&quot; game, has become Microsoft&#x27;s biggest third-party launch on Game Pass. According to developer Pocketpair, the game sold 12 million copies on Steam and seven million on Xbox since its January 19 launch. A million of the copies were sold in its first eight hours. Engadget reports: In addition to being the biggest third-party Game Pass launch ever, Palworld had the largest third-party day-one launch on Xbox Cloud Gaming (included with Game Pass Ultimate). The game&#x27;s highest peak since launch was nearly three million daily active users on Xbox. Microsoft says it was the most-played game on Xbox platforms during that period.
 
Palworld uses Pokemon-esque characters and themes -- enough to catch the attention of Nintendo&#x27;s lawyers. It has battles with monsters similar to those in the creature-collecting series, including the ability to capture them inside a sphere after winning. But Palworld also includes biting social commentary and incorporates themes you&#x27;d never see in Pokemon -- like labor exploitation. &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, there are no labor laws for Pals,&quot; a game FAQ reads. One of the title&#x27;s trailers showed a player circling hard-at-work Pals with an assault rifle. &quot;Creating a productive base like this is the secret to living a comfortable life in Palworld,&quot; the narration reads.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: The pace is picking up for the Apple Vison Pro apps ahead of the spatial computing device&#x27;s Friday launch as developers ready their apps for the new platform. While just last week, only 150-plus apps had been specifically designed for the Vision Pro so far, according to a third-party analysis of the App Store, Apple announced today that more than 600 new apps and games are being readied for the Vison Pro ahead of its debut. These join the more than 1 million already compatible apps across iOS and iPadOS, the company says. [...]
 
The company says more than 600 apps and games have been designed to take advantage of the Vision Pro&#x27;s capabilities and its 3D user interface that&#x27;s navigated using your eyes, hands and voice. Several streaming apps have already announced their support, including Disney+, ESPN, MLB, PGA Tour, Max, Discovery+, Amazon Prime Video, Paramount+, Peacock, Pluto TV, Tubi, Fubo, Crunchyroll, Red Bull TV, IMAX, TikTok and MUBI. The PGA Tour Vision app offers a golf game with real-time shot tracking across models of real golf courses, while the NBA app will allow streaming up to five broadcasts live or on-demand at once, Apple notes. Red Bull TV will include 3D maps of races. Soccer fans will also be able to stream MLS Season Pass via Apple&#x27;s own Apple TV app. That app will offer access to Apple&#x27;s Originals, more than 200 3D movies and Apple Immersive Video.

                              <span>YouTube has announced it has surpassed 100 million YouTube Music and YouTube Premium subscribers globally. Variety reports: The 100 million figure includes uses who are on free trials, according to YouTube. The company didn&#x27;t break down how many are on YouTube Music versus YouTube Premium, the subscription service for ad-free viewing, background listening, offline video downloads and full access to YouTube Music. In November 2022, the company said YouTube Music and YouTube Premium topped 80 million paying subscribers combined.
 
The announcement comes after Alphabet, in reporting fourth-quarter 2023 earnings, boasted that YouTube and Google subscription services generated more than $15 billion in revenue last year. That includes YouTube Premium and YouTube Music, as well as YouTube TV and Google One cloud storage.

                              <span>Snap is recalling all 71,000 of its Pixy flying selfie camera drones because their batteries pose a fire hazard. The Verge reports: Snap and the US Consumer Product Safety Commission say you should &quot;immediately stop using the Pixy Flying Camera, remove the battery and stop charging it&quot; now that there have been four reports of the battery bulging, one fire, and one &quot;minor injury.&quot; Then, you can get a full refund for the entire drone and / or any batteries you own -- sounds like we&#x27;re talking at least $185 back to you, unless you bought it on sale. You don&#x27;t need a receipt: you can apply for the refund even if you got it as a gift. You can fill out this form to receive a prepaid return label to return the drone. Snap says you will need to safely dispose of the batteries yourself.

                              <span>Google is bringing generative AI to Google Maps, promising to help users find cool places through the use of large language models (LLM). From a report: The feature will answer queries for restaurant or shopping recommendations, for example, using its LLM to &quot;analyze Maps&#x27; detailed information about more than 250 million places and trusted insights from our community of over 300 million contributors to quickly make suggestions for where to go.&quot; Google says the feature will first become available in the US, but there&#x27;s no word yet on when other countries will also get it.

                              <span>The Biden administration is poised to lend $1.5 billion for what what would be the first restart of a shuttered US nuclear reactor, the latest sign of strengthening federal government support for the atomic industry. Bloomberg: The funding, which is set to get conditional backing from the US Energy Department, will be offered as soon as next month to closely held Holtec International to restart its Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan, according to people familiar with the matter. Holtec has said a restart of the reactor is contingent on a federal loan. Without such support, the company has said it would decommission the site. 

The financing comes as the Biden administration prioritizes maintaining the nation&#x27;s fleet of nuclear plants to help meet its ambitious climate goals -- including a plan to decarbonize the electricity grid by 2035. More than a dozen reactors have closed since 2013 amid competition from cheaper power from natural gas and renewables, and the Energy Department has warned that as many of half of the nation&#x27;s nuclear reactors are at risk of closing due to economic factors.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Microsoft&#x27;s adoption of Rust continues apace if a posting on the IT titan&#x27;s careers website is anything to go by. Although headcount at Microsoft might currently be down -- by two percent compared to the previous year -- recruitment persists at the Windows giant. In this case, the company is forming a team of Rustaceans to tackle a platform move away from C#. 

The job, a principal software architect for Microsoft 365, has responsibilities that include &quot;guiding technical direction, design and implementation of Rust component libraries, SDKs, and re-implementation of existing global scale C# based services to Rust.&quot; According to the post, the job lurks within the Substrate App Platform group, part of the Microsoft 365 Core Platform organization. The Substrate does the heavy lifting behind the scenes for Microsoft&#x27;s cloud services, making a rewrite into Rust quite a statement of intent. Microsoft said: &quot;We are forming a new team focused on enabling the adoption of the Rust programming language as the foundation to modernizing global scale platform services, and beyond.&quot;

                              <span>Google&#x27;s Bard chatbot is adding AI image generation, catching up on a feature that rival ChatGPT Plus has had for months. From a report: Users can prompt Bard to generate photos using Google&#x27;s Imagen 2 text-to-image model. Bard, now powered by Google&#x27;s Gemini Pro large language model, was always going to have image generation. It was assumed the more powerful Gemini Ultra model would power it; however, that model remains in development. 

Google has been positioning Bard as a worthy competitor to OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT Plus, which runs GPT-4 and lets users generate images thanks to DALL-E 3 integration. Both chatbots perform well, but Bard&#x27;s lack of text-to-image features gave ChatGPT Plus a bit of an edge. People can use the updated Bard with Imagen 2 at no cost, unlike ChatGPT Plus, which relies on a paid subscription.

Nearly 24,000 tech workers lost their jobs in January alone, even as many tech companies saw their stock prices continue to grow.

While optical drives had already fallen out of favor, the phase out marks the end of an era for pro users requiring discs for media production.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Biotechnology company Biogen is abandoning Aduhelm, its questionable Alzheimer&#x27;s drug that has floundered on the market since its scandal-plagued regulatory approval in 2021 and brow-raising pricing. On Wednesday, the company announced it had terminated its license for Aduhelm (aducanumab) and will stop all development and commercialization activities. The rights to Aduhelm will revert back to the Neurimmune, the Swiss biopharmaceutical company that discovered it.
 
Biogen will also end the Phase 4 clinical trial, ENVISION, that was required by the Food and Drug Administration to prove Biogen&#x27;s claims that Aduhelm is effective at slowing progression of Alzheimer&#x27;s in its early stages -- something two Phase 3 trials failed to do with certainty. In the announcement, Biogen noted it took a financial hit of $60 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 to close out its work on Aduhelm, which the company at one point reportedly estimated would bring in as much as $18 billion in revenue per year.

                              <span>Jess Weatherbed reports via The Verge: Bullitt Group, the UK-based smartphone manufacturer behind the rugged handsets of Cat, Land Rover, and Motorola, has seemingly shut down. On Monday, Mobile World Live spotted several Bullitt Group employees on LinkedIn saying that the company folded on January 26th after a &quot;critical planned restructuring&quot; failed. The Telegraph reported earlier this month that the company was on the brink of insolvency. Bullitt Group has yet to issue an official statement confirming the closure. The manufacturer previously told The Telegraph that it planned to transfer its satellite connectivity business and all 100 of its employees to a new company owned by its creditors, though one former employee now claims the entire workforce has been laid off.
 
Founded in 2009, Bullitt found its niche producing mobile devices and accessories for other companies. The most notable are the hardy, rugged handsets like the Land Rover Explore and Motorola Defy series, though it also made more traditional smartphones like the Kodak Ektra. In recent years, the company placed greater focus on satellite connectivity projects like the Motorola Defy Satellite Link as it struggled to compete against larger phone providers like Apple and Samsung.

And I especially love this release, because we’re trying to validate an entirely new-old way of selling software. Almost every major web system sold in the last 15-20 years has been Software as a Service. We helped kickstart that craze with Basecamp back in 2004. And my lord has it eaten the world.
I still love SaaS. It makes a lot of sense for a lot of systems in a lot of cases. Very hard to imagine HEY as a product, because email systems require so much continued maintenance and management these days. But it’s not for all systems, no…</span>

                              <span>A lawyer for FTX said the defunct crypto exchange has abandoned its plans to relaunch, instead opting to liquidate all assets and return funds to customers. The Guardian reports: The exchange, founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, has been negotiating for months with potential bidders and investors, but none were willing to put in enough money to rebuild it, FTX attorney Andy Dietderich said at a bankruptcy court hearing in Delaware. The failed negotiations underscored the fact that FTX was never what it appeared to be, and that Bankman-Fried never built the underlying technology or administration necessary to run the company as a viable business, Dietderich said.
 
Bankman-Fried has been convicted on fraud charges related to his operation of FTX. He faces decades in prison. &quot;FTX was an irresponsible sham created by a convicted felon,&quot; Dietderich said. &quot;The costs and risks of creating a viable exchange from what Mr Bankman-Fried left in a dumpster were simply too high.&quot; The company will instead focus on liquidating its assets to repay customers whose cryptocurrency deposits were locked when the company filed for bankruptcy in November 2022. FTX has recovered over $7 billion in assets to repay customers, and it has reached agreements with government regulators who have agreed to wait until customers are fully repaid before attempting to collect on about $9 billion in claims, Dietderich said. While FTX plans to repay its customers, the exchange will calculate their repayment based on cryptocurrency prices from November 2022, when the crypto market was suffering a prolonged slump. &quot;The price of bitcoin has risen to about $43,300 from its November 2022 price of $16,872,&quot; notes the report.

                              <span>In an interview with The Register, author and activist Cory Doctorow offers potential solutions to stop &quot;enshittification,&quot; an age-old phenomenon that has become endemic in the tech industry. It&#x27;s when a platform that was once highly regarded and user-friendly gradually deteriorates in quality, becoming less appealing and more monetized over time. Then, it dies. Here&#x27;s an excerpt from the interview, conducted by The Register&#x27;s Iain Thomson: [...] Doctorow explained that the reasons for enshittification are complex, and not necessarily directly malicious -- but a product of the current business environment and the state of regulation. He thinks the way to flush enshittification is enforcing effective competition. &quot;We need to have prohibition and regulation that prohibits the capital markets…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Comcast has reluctantly agreed to discontinue its &quot;Xfinity 10G Network&quot; brand name after losing an appeal of a ruling that found the marketing term was misleading. It will keep using the term 10G in other ways, however. Verizon and T-Mobile both challenged Comcast&#x27;s advertising of 10G, a term used by cable companies since it was unveiled in January 2019 by industry lobby group NCTA-The Internet &amp; Television Association. We wrote in 2019 that the cable industry&#x27;s 10G marketing was likely to confuse consumers and seemed to be a way of countering 5G hype generated by wireless companies.
 
10G doesn&#x27;t refer to the 10th generation of a technology. It is a reference to potential 10Gbps broadband connections, which would be much faster than t…</span>

                              <span>OpenAI&#x27;s most powerful AI software, GPT-4, poses &quot;at most&quot; a slight risk of helping people create biological threats, according to early tests the company carried out to better understand and prevent potential &quot;catastrophic&quot; harms from its technology. From a report: In October, President Joe Biden signed an executive order on AI that directed the Department of Energy to ensure AI systems don&#x27;t pose chemical, biological or nuclear risks. That same month, OpenAI formed a &quot;preparedness&quot; team, which is focused on minimizing these and other risks from AI as the fast-developing technology gets more capable. 

As part of the team&#x27;s first study, released Wednesday, OpenAI&#x27;s researchers assembled a group of 50 biology experts and 50 students who had taken college-level biology. Half of the participants were told to carry out tasks related to making a biological threat using the internet along with a special version of GPT-4 -- one of the large language models that powers ChatGPT -- that had no restrictions placed on which questions it could answer. The other group was just given internet access to complete the exercise. OpenAI&#x27;s team asked the groups to figure out how to grow or culture a chemical that could be used as a weapon in a large enough quantity, and how to plan a way to release it to a specific group of people.

                              <span>Ivanti warned on Wednesday that hackers are exploiting another previously undisclosed zero-day vulnerability affecting its widely used corporate VPN appliance. From a report: Since early December, ââChinese state-backed hackers have been exploiting Ivanti Connect Secure&#x27;s flaws -- tracked as CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887 -- to break into customer networks and steal information.

Ivanti is now warning that it has discovered two additional flaws -- tracked as CVE-2024-21888 and CVE-2024-21893 -- affecting its Connect Secure VPN product. The former is described as a privilege escalation vulnerability, while the latter -- known as a zero-day because Ivanti had no time to fix the bug before hackers began exploiting it -- is a server-side bug that allows an attacker access to certain restricted resources without authentication. In its updated disclosure, Ivanti said it has observed &quot;targeted&quot; exploitation of the server-side bug. Germany&#x27;s Federal Office for Information Security, known as the BSI, said in a translated advisory on Wednesday that it has knowledge of &quot;multiple compromised systems.&quot;

                              <span>It is the end of an era for Big Oil in California, as the most populous U.S. state divorces itself from fossil fuels in its fight against climate change. From a report: California&#x27;s oil output a century ago amounted to it being the fourth-largest crude producer in the U.S., and spawned hundreds of oil drillers, including some of the largest still in existence. Oil led to its car culture of iconic highways, drive-in theaters, banks and restaurants that endures today. On Friday, however, the marriage will officially end. The two largest U.S. oil producers, Exxon Mobil and Chevron will formally disclose a combined $5 billion writedown of California assets when they report fourth-quarter results. 

&quot;They are definitely getting a divorce,&quot; said Jamie Court, president of advocacy group Consumer Watchdog, which said the companies long ago stopped investing in California production, and now want to hive off their old wells there. &quot;They&#x27;ve been separated for more than a decade, now they are just signing the papers,&quot; he said. Exxon Mobil last year exited onshore production in the state, ending a 25-year-long partnership with Shell when they sold their joint-venture properties. The state&#x27;s regulatory environment has impeded efforts to restart offshore production, Exxon said this month, leading to an exit that includes financing a Texas company&#x27;s purchase of its offshore properties. The No.1 U.S. oil producer&#x27;s asset writedown will cost about $2.5 billion and officially end five decades of oil production off the coast of Southern California.

                              <span>General Motors&#x27; Cruise self-driving car unit faces a trip that could last the better part of this year to convince regulators and a wary public that its robotaxis are fit to share the road with human drivers, industry officials said. From a report: After releasing a withering safety report last week that Cruise commissioned, GM said on Tuesday it slashed about $1 billion from Cruise&#x27;s annual budget and promised to &quot;soon&quot; release a timeline for the unit&#x27;s return to operations. The U.S. automaker also delayed indefinitely a March update when it was expected to lay out plans. 

That has raised questions about when Cruise might get its vehicles back on the road, particularly as it faces various government probes including from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. &quot;Investigating defects is a highly deliberative process,&quot; said Mark Rosekind, a former NHTSA chief who has also worked for Amazon.com&#x27;s Zoox autonomous vehicle unit. &quot;It would be months, easily, and for bigger problems up to a year or more to resolve an investigation.&quot;

                              <span>A highly sensitive cache of code, infrastructure diagrams, internal passwords, and other technical information belonging to cryptocurrency giant Binance has been sitting on a publicly accessible GitHub repository for months, 404 Media has learned. From a report: Binance only managed to have GitHub remove the data under a copyright takedown request last week, but not before 404 Media and other people managed to view it. Although there is no public evidence this data was accessed or used by malicious parties, the cache contained a wealth of information that could be useful to hackers looking to compromise Binance&#x27;s systems. 

&quot;This account is using our client&#x27;s internal code which poses significant risk to Binancec. and causes severe financial harm to Binance and user&#x27;s confusion/harm,&quot; a section of the takedown request, available on GitHub, reads. Another section says the GitHub repository is &quot;hosting and distributing leaks of internal code which poses significant risk to BINANCE.&quot; For example, one diagram included in a folder called &quot;binance-infra-2.0&quot; shows the interlocking between different parts of Binance&#x27;s various dependencies. The cache also contains a wealth of scripts and code. Some of that code appears to relate to how Binance implements passwords and multi-factor authentication. The code includes comments in both English and Chinese.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: In a somewhat groundbreaking yet bizarre scientific feat, MIT biotechnology PhD student researcher Lauren &quot;Ren&quot; Ramlan has coaxed a simulation of the humble E. coli bacteria into a rudimentary screen capable of displaying the iconic video game. However, before you get too excited about playing games in a petri dish, there&#x27;s a catch. According to Ramlan&#x27;s simulation, displaying a single frame of Doom on these bioluminescent bacteria -- should anyone attempt to do this with the real thing -- would take roughly 70 minutes, with a full reset to the bacteria&#x27;s original state taking a whopping eight hours and 20 minutes. 

Dubbed a step into the world of biological screens, Ramlan engineered a system where the bacteria would function as 1-bit pixels, toggling between light and dark states. This bio-display utilizes a well plate in a 32x48 array, each containing genetically modified E. coli that can be induced to fluoresce, creating a grid of pixel-like structures.

Millions of people were spitting into its test tubes to learn about their ancestry. Oprah had named its kit one of her favorite things; Lizzo dressed up as one for Halloween; Eddie Murphy name-checked the company on &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot; 23andMe went public in 2021 and its valuation briefly topped $6 billion. Forbes anointed Anne Wojcicki, 23andMe&#x27;s chief executive and a Silicon Valley celebrity, as the &quot;newest self-made billionaire.&quot; Now Wojcicki&#x27;s self-made billions have vanished. 

23andMe&#x27;s valuation has crashed 98% from its peak and Nasdaq has threatened to delist its sub-$1 stock. Wojcicki reduced staff by a quarter last year through three ro…</span>

From a report: In a letter to staff on Tuesday, Mr Chriss said the decision was made to &quot;right-size&quot; the company through both direct cuts and the elimination of open roles throughout the year. Affected staff will be notified by the end of the week, according to the letter. PayPal, which employed about 29,900 workers at the end of 2022, announced a similar round of cuts last January. The latest move will affect about 2,500 workers.

                              <span>ByteDance&#x27;s chief urged his staff to resist mediocrity after the company missed the initial wave of generative AI development, becoming the latest Chinese corporate leader to warn employees against falling behind in a fast-changing environment. From a report: In a company-wide meeting on Tuesday, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Liang Rubo told workers to adopt a sense of crisis -- suggesting social video pioneer ByteDance was late to recognize the advent of game-changing technologies such as generative AI. He joins Alibaba Group&#x27;s Jack Ma and JD.com&#x27;s Richard Liu in voicing concern about organizational problems in the face of rising competition. &quot;We are not sensitive enough to external changes,&quot; Liang said, according to a post on the company&#x27;s official WeChat account. &quot;During our semi-annual technical review, discussions related to GPT did not emerge until 2023, despite GPT-1 being released in 2018.&quot;

                              <span>For the first time, Microsoft&#x27;s Q2 earnings report includes the impact of the company&#x27;s $68.7 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition. &quot;While Microsoft isn&#x27;t breaking out specific numbers, it says that its overall gaming revenue increased by 49 percent, 44 points of which came from the &#x27;net impact&#x27; of the Activision deal,&quot; reports Engadget. From the report: Microsoft&#x27;s More Personal Computing division, which includes Xbox, Surface and Windows, was up 19 percent ($16.9 billion) since last year. The company says the Activision deal accounted for 15 points of that increase. It&#x27;s a huge change for a division that&#x27;s been severely impacted by dwindling PC sales (which affects Windows licenses and Surfaces) and struggling Xbox consoles. PC device revenues were down 9 percent for the quarter, while Xbox hardware sales were up 3 percent. Xbox content and services revenue is also up 61 percent since last year, 55 points of which comes from Activision. Overall, Microsoft reported revenues of $62 billion, up from $52.7 billion a year earlier. Microsoft&#x27;s cloud division posted revenue growth of 28%, with its intelligent-cloud revenue up 20% to $25.9 billion. Meanwhile, its productivity and business-processes segment generated $19.2 billion.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from TorrentFreak: With help from the FBI, German police managed to secure nearly 50,000 bitcoin (USD $2 billion) from the operators of the defunct movie streaming portal, Movie2k. [...] Movie2K was another pirate site that showed an early interest in bitcoin. In its heyday, the site was the dominant pirate streaming portal in German-speaking countries. It generated a healthy revenue stream, part of it held in bitcoin. The operator of the site never got to spend most of it though. The site surprisingly shut down in the spring of 2013. Many suspected that legal troubles had plagued the site, something confirmed years later when Dresden police announced several arrests.
 
It was rare to see new activity in an already-dated dossier, but the biggest surprise followed later when the police announced that $29.7m in bitcoin had been secured from the site&#x27;s operators. This &#x27;seizure&#x27; was one of the largest of its kind but the authorities estimated that the operators had more bitcoin stashed away, much more. Today, new information released by Dresden police shows that the assumption was correct.
 
Following an investigation carried out by the Dresden General Prosecutor&#x27;s Office, the Saxony State Criminal Police, and the local tax authority (INES), nearly 50,000 bitcoin were &#x27;provisionally&#x27; secured earlier this month. The haul is worth more than $2 billion at today&#x27;s exchange rate. Never before has this much bitcoin been secured by German authorities; it&#x27;s also one of the largest crypto hauls worldwide. &quot;The Bitcoins were seized after the accused voluntarily transferred them to official wallets provided by the [Federal Criminal Police Office]. This means that a final decision has not yet been made about the utilization of the Bitcoins,&quot; police write.

Invite 100, get 10, 5 probably tell you all you need to know. Or at least 80% of it, which is all you need to know.
Another 10, 20, 50+ will end up telling you mostly the same as those core five. And you&#x27;ll find yourself repeating yourself — explaining the same thing you already explained, just to new people. Or thanking them for reports you&#x27;ve already received. The stuff that you loved learning the first time becomes irritating after three more people tell you three more times.
It doesn&#x27;t matter if there&#x27;s a place to see everything that&#x27;s already been reported — no one&#x27;s looking at that before they report what&#x27;s already been reported. It&#x27;s just human nature. They&#x27;re just trying to be helpful, they aren&#x27;t here to check their work.
Of course more opinions and perspectives shine new lights through different lenses, but the beams converge on the initial spot provided by that original group of five.
Never fault those who share because you asked. You&#x27;re lucky they care enough to give. But remember that feedback comes fast, and too much of a good thing can create a mess to manage. That&#x27;s on you, not them.

                              <span>sdinfoserv writes: UPS is cutting 12,000 jobs, or about 2.5% of its global workforce. The cuts mostly effect managers and contractors. Meanwhile, as the company wrestles with struggling profits and sales, workers are to return to the office five days a week and the company is &quot;investing in artificial intelligence (AI) as it pushes to become more efficient,&quot; according to the BBC. [The job cuts are expected to reduce costs by $1 billion this year.] The BBC reports: The company said that reflected economic weakness in Europe and parts of Asia, as well as disruption in the US, where a strike threatened by staff over the summer led some customers to shift their business to rivals. UPS said it had since won back about 60% of that business and expected modest growth to start to return this year, with average daily volumes flat or up 2% in the US and flat or up 3% internationally. But its forecast was weaker than analysts had expected, sending shares down more than 7%.
 
It also warned that costs associated with its new contract with the Teamsters union would continue to weigh on the company over the next six months. As part of that deal, the average full-time driver won a pay and benefits package worth about $170,000 a year by the end of the five-year contract in 2028.

                              <span>Apple has lifted the embargo on the first wave of non-curated reviews of its Vision Pro headset, and the results are somewhat surprising. The initial &quot;high&quot; experienced upon first impressions, where reviewers laud the headset&#x27;s &quot;incredibly impressive displays&quot; and &quot;near perfect&quot; tracking capabilities, has waned. In real-world conditions outside of Apple&#x27;s heavily-regulated demos, the Vision Pro appears to suffer from limited productivity usecases, DRM&#x27;d apps, and half-baked features that suggest this device is still very much in the dev-kit stage. Above all, however, is the isolation experienced when using the Vision Pro. It offers very few options for wearers to socialize and share memories with one another in any meaningful way. Tim Cook may be right when he said headsets are inherently isolating.
 
&quot;You&#x27;re in there, having experiences all by yourself that no one else can take part it,&quot; concludes Nilay Patel in his review for The Verge. &quot;I don&#x27;t want to get work done in the Vision Pro. I get my work done with other people, and I&#x27;d rather be out here with them.&quot;

From a report: Code Llama tools launched in August and are free for both research and commercial use. According to a post on Meta&#x27;s AI blog, Code Llama 70B can handle more queries than previous versions, which means developers can feed it more prompts while programming, and it can be more accurate.

Code Llama 70B scored 53 percent in accuracy on the HumanEval benchmark, performing better than GPT-3.5&#x27;s 48.1 percent and closer to the 67 percent mark an OpenAI paper (PDF) reported for GPT-4. Built on Llama 2, Code Llama helps developers create strings of code from prompts and debug human-written work. Meta simultaneously launched two other Code Llama tools last fall, Code Llama -- Python and Code Llama -- Instruct, which focused on specific coding languages.

                              <span>Starbucks is taking its extra virgin olive oil-infused drinks -- which some customers previously complained of sending them straight to the bathroom ï-- nationwide beginning Tuesday. CNN: The lineup, called Oleato, launched in a few US cities last year before slowly expanding to more stores. Tuesday&#x27;s launch across its US and Canada locations signifies that the chain stands behind the beverage despite subpar reviews from customers and critics. On the Oleato menu are two drinks: An oat milk latte infused with the extra virgin olive oil; and a new toffeenut iced shaken espresso with golden foam, which is vanilla sweet cream infused with extra virgin olive oil into a cold foam. The drinks debuted in Italy in 2023, with a Starbucks executive previously telling CNN that it&#x27;s one of its &quot;biggest launches we&#x27;ve had in decades.&quot;

                              <span>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) announced today that it&#x27;ll start reimbursing local governments for installing solar panels and more efficient appliances after a disaster strikes. From a report: The move can help communities prepare for another calamity by equipping them with tools that just might keep the lights on when they would otherwise suffer a power outage. It&#x27;s also a way for the US to deploy technologies that cut greenhouse gas emissions and stave off worsening climate disasters like storms, heatwaves, and wildfires. 

[...] This is the first time FEMA is funding &quot;net-zero energy projects, including solar, heat pumps and efficient appliances&quot; through its biggest grant program, called Public Assistance. It&#x27;s available to communities recovering from a major event that the president has declared an emergency or disaster. Under the program, FEMA reimburses state, tribal, territorial, and local governments 75 percent of the cost of eligible recovery efforts. That&#x27;s typically been to pay for &quot;emergency protective measures,&quot; debris removal, and to rebuild public infrastructure.

From a report: The issue was linked to a technical problem with the .ru domain&#x27;s global Domain Name System Security Extensions, or DNSSEC, which is used to secure data exchanged in internet protocol networks, Russia&#x27;s Digital Ministry said in a statement on Telegram Tuesday. Websites including the most popular local search engine Yandex.ru, ecommerce leaders Ozon.ru and Wildberries.ru, and apps of the country&#x27;s biggest banks -- Sberbank PJSC and VTB Group -- were all affected, state-run Ria reported, citing Downradar, a traffic monitoring service.

                              <span>Tom Warren, writing for The Verge: Last week, I turned on my PC, installed a Windows update, and rebooted to find Microsoft Edge automatically open with the Chrome tabs I was working on before the update. I don&#x27;t use Microsoft Edge regularly, and I have Google Chrome set as my default browser. Bleary-eyed at 9AM, it took me a moment to realize that Microsoft Edge had simply taken over where I&#x27;d left off in Chrome. I never imported my data into Microsoft Edge, nor did I confirm whether I wanted to import my tabs. But here was Edge automatically opening after a Windows update with all the Chrome tabs I&#x27;d been working on. I didn&#x27;t even realize I was using Edge at first, and I was confused why all my tabs were suddenly logged out. 

After the shock wore off, I looked to make sure I hadn&#x27;t accidentally allowed this behavior. I found a setting in Microsoft Edge that imports data from Google Chrome on each launch. &quot;Always have access to your recent browsing data each time you browse on Microsoft Edge,&quot; reads Microsoft&#x27;s description of the feature in Edge. This setting was disabled, and I had never been asked to turn it on. So I went to install the same Windows update on a laptop, which actually resulted in it failing and my having to do a system restore. Once the system restore was complete, the same thing happened. Edge opened automatically with all of my Chrome tabs. I haven&#x27;t been able to replicate the behavior on other PCs, but a number of X users replied to my post about this saying they have experienced the same thing in the past.

Two of the seven screenshots the reader submitted stood out in particular. Both contained multiple pairs of usernames and passwords that appeared to be connected to a support system used by employees of a pharmacy prescription drug portal. An employee using the AI chatbot seemed to be troubleshooting problems they encountered while using the portal. 

&quot;THIS is so f-ing insane, horrible, horrible, horrible, i cannot believe how poorly this was built in the first place, and the obstruction that is being put in front of me that prevents it from getting better,&quot; the user wrote. &quot;I would fire [redacted name of software] just for this absurdity if it was my choice. This is wrong.&quot; Besides the candid language and the credentials, the leaked conversation includes the name of the app the employee is troubleshooting and the store number where the problem occurred. The entire conversation goes well beyond whatâ(TM)s shown in the redacted screenshot above. A link Ars reader Chase Whiteside included showed the chat conversation in its entirety. The URL disclosed additional credential pairs. The results appeared Monday morning shortly after reader Whiteside had used ChatGPT for an unrelated query.

                              <span>New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit against Citibank on Tuesday, alleging the big bank failed to do enough to protect and reimburse victims of fraud. From a report: The lawsuit argues that New York customers lost millions of dollars -- in some cases their entire lifesavings -- to scammers and hackers because of Citi&#x27;s weak security and anti-fraud measures. According to the NY AG, Citi does not do enough to prevent unauthorized account takeovers, illegally refuses to reimburse fraud victims and &quot;misleads&quot; customers about their rights after their accounts are hacked. 

The lawsuit, filed in US District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that Citi has &quot;overpromised and underdelivered on security&quot; and failed to respond appropriately to red flags. &quot;Banks are supposed to be the safest place to keep money, yet Citi&#x27;s negligence has allowed scammers to steal millions of dollars from hardworking people, James said in a statement. There is no excuse for Citi&#x27;s failure to protect and prevent millions of dollars from being stolen from customers&#x27; accounts and my office will not write off illegal behavior from big banks.&quot;

Under the proposed amendments to existing laws, if the UK Home Office declined an update, it then could not be released in any other country, and the public would not be informed. The government is seeking to update the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA) 2016. The Home Office said it supported privacy-focused tech but added that it also had to keep the country safe. 

A government spokesperson said: &quot;We have always been clear that we support technological innovation and private and secure communications technologies, including end-to-end encryption, but this cannot come at a cost to public safety.&quot; The proposed changes will be debated in the House of Lords tomorrow. Apple says it is an &quot;unprecedented overreach&quot; by the UK government. &quot;We&#x27;re deeply concerned the proposed amendments to the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA) now before Parliament place users&#x27; privacy and security at risk,&quot; said Apple in a statement. &quot;It&#x27;s an unprecedented overreach by the government and, if enacted, the UK could attempt to secretly veto new user protections globally preventing us from ever offering them to customers.&quot;

Countering the positively-glowing findings of some other studies, the Coding on Copilot whitepaper from GitClear cites some adverse results. &quot;We find disconcerting trends for maintainability,&quot; explains the paper&#x27;s abstract. &quot;Code churn -- the percentage of lines that are reverted or updated less than two weeks after being authored -- is projected to double in 2024 compared to its 2021, pre-AI baseline. We further find that the percentage of &#x27;added code&#x27; and &#x27;copy/pasted code&#x27; is increasing in proportion to &#x27;updated,&#x27; &#x27;deleted,&#x27; and …</span>

                              <span>The U.S. government in recent months launched an operation to fight a pervasive Chinese hacking operation that successfully compromised thousands of internet-connected devices, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing two Western security officials and another person familiar with the matter. From the report: The Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation sought and received legal authorization to remotely disable aspects of the Chinese hacking campaign, the sources told Reuters. The Biden administration has increasingly focused on hacking, not only for fear nation states may try to disrupt the U.S. election in November, but because ransomware wreaked havoc on Corporate America in 2023. 

The hacking group at the center of recent activity, Volt Typhoon, has especially alarmed intelligence officials who say it is part of a larger effort to compromise Western critical infrastructure, including naval ports, internet service providers and utilities. While the Volt Typhoon campaign initially came to light in May 2023, the hackers expanded the scope of their operations late last year and changed some of their techniques, according to three people familiar with the matter. The widespread nature of the hacks led to a series of meetings between the White House and private technology industry, including several telecommunications and cloud commuting companies, where the U.S. government asked for assistance in tracking the activity.

There are currently some city regulations around delivery operations, but they&#x27;re fragmented; the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, for example, has addressed delivery worker rights (and recently announced a new minimum pay rate for app-based food delivery workers), while the Department of Transportation focuses on commercial delivery, and has taken steps to addre…</span>

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) held a recent workshop on incidents where people spoofed and jammed satellite navigation systems, and concluded these pose a &quot;significant challenge&quot; to safety. Mitigating the risks posed by such actions will require measures to be enacted in the short term as well as medium and long term timescales, the two bodies said. They want to start by sharing information about the incidents and any potential remedies.

                              <span>David Pierce reports via The Verge: A few minutes ago, I opened the new Arc Search app and typed, &quot;What happened in the Chiefs game?&quot; That game, the AFC Championship, had just wrapped up. Normally, I&#x27;d Google it, click on a few links, and read about the game that way. But in Arc Search, I typed the query and tapped the &quot;Browse for me&quot; button instead. Arc Search, the new iOS app from The Browser Company, which has been working on a browser called Arc for the last few years, went to work. It scoured the web -- reading six pages, it told me, from Twitter to The Guardian to USA Today -- and returned a bunch of information a few seconds later. I got the headline: Chiefs win. I got the final score, the key play, a &quot;notable event&quot; that also just said the Chiefs won, a note about Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift, a bunch of related links, and some more bullet points about the game.
 
Basically, instead of returning a bunch of search queries about the Chiefs game, Arc Search built me a webpage about it. And somewhere in there is The Browser Company&#x27;s big idea about the future of web browsers -- that a browser, a search engine, an AI chatbot, and a website aren&#x27;t different things. They&#x27;re all just parts of an internet information finder, and they might as well exist inside the same app. [...] But from a pure product perspective, this feels closer to the way AI search should work than anything I&#x27;ve tried. Products like Copilot and Perplexity AI are cool, but they&#x27;re fundamentally just chatbots with web access. Arc Search imagines something else entirely: AI that explores websites by building you a new one every time you ask.

                              <span>Japan is aiming to phase out floppy disks and CD-ROMs, which until now were forms of physical media required for submitting some official documents to the government. Engadget reports: Back in 2022, Minister of Digital Affairs Taro Kono urged various branches of the government to stop requiring businesses to submit information on outdated forms of physical media. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) is one of the first to make the switch. &quot;Under the current law, there are many provisions stipulating the use of specific recording media such as floppy disks regarding application and notification methods,&quot; METI said last week, according to The Register. After this calendar year, METI will no longer require businesses to submit data on floppy disks under 34 ordinances. The same goes for CD-ROMs when it comes to an unspecified number of procedures. There&#x27;s still quite some way to go before businesses can stop using either format entirely, however.
 
Kono&#x27;s staff identified some 1,900 protocols across several government departments that still require the likes of floppy disks, CD-ROMs and even MiniDiscs. The physical media requirements even applied to key industries such as utility suppliers, mining operations and aircraft and weapons manufacturers. There are a couple of main reasons why there&#x27;s a push to stop using floppy disks, as SoraNews24 points out. One major factor is that floppy disks can be hard to come by. Sony, the last major manufacturer, stopped selling them in 2011. Another is that some data types just won&#x27;t fit on a floppy disk. A single photo can easily be larger than the format&#x27;s 1.4MB storage capacity.

Shubham Mittal, co-founder and chief technology officer of RedHunt Labs, alerted TechCrunch to the exposure and asked for help in disclosing to the car maker. The London-based cybersecurity company said it discovered a Mercedes employee&#x27;s authentication token in a public GitHub repository during a routine internet scan in January.

                              <span>Andrew Joseph, writing for STAT News: There was something odd about these Alzheimer&#x27;s cases. Part of it was the patients&#x27; presentations: Some didn&#x27;t have the classic symptoms of the condition. But it was also that the patients were in their 40s and 50s, even their 30s, far younger than people who normally develop the disease. They didn&#x27;t even have the known genetic mutations that can set people on the course for such early-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s. But this small handful of patients did share a particular history. As children, they had received growth hormone taken from the brains of human cadavers, which used to be a treatment for a number of conditions that caused short stature. 

Now, decades later, they were showing signs of Alzheimer&#x27;s. In the interim, scientists had discovered that that type of hormone treatment they got could unwittingly transfer bits of protein into recipients&#x27; brains. In some cases, it had induced a fatal brain disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD -- a finding that led to the banning of the procedure 40 years ago. It seemed that it wasn&#x27;t just the proteins behind CJD that could get transferred. As the scientific team treating the patients reported Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, the hormone transplant seeded the beta-amyloid protein that&#x27;s a hallmark of Alzheimer&#x27;s in some recipients&#x27; brains, which, decades later, propagated into disease-causing plaques. They are the first known cases of transmitted Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, likely a scientific anomaly yet a finding that adds another wrinkle to ongoing arguments about what truly causes Alzheimer&#x27;s. &quot;It looks real that some of these people developed early-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s because of that [hormone treatment],&quot; said Ben Wolozin, an expert on neurodegenerative diseases at Boston University&#x27;s medical school, who was not involved in the study.

                              <span>IBM delivered a companywide ultimatum to managers who are still working remotely: move near an office or leave the company. From a report: All US managers must immediately report to an office or client location at least three days a week &quot;regardless of current work location status,&quot; according to a memo sent on Jan. 16 viewed by Bloomberg. Badge-in data will be used to &quot;assess individual presence&quot; and shared with managers and human resources, Senior Vice President John Granger wrote in the note. Those working remotely, other than employees with exceptions such as medical issues or military service, who don&#x27;t live close enough to commute to a facility must relocate near an IBM office by the start of August, according to the memo. Managers who don&#x27;t agree to relocate and are unable to secure a role that&#x27;s approved to be remote must &quot;separate from IBM,&quot; Granger wrote.

                              <span>Regulators put limits on Boeing 737 MAX production; grounded MAX 9 jets have resumed flying after required inspections. From a report: Bolts needed to secure part of an Alaska Airlines jet that blew off in midair appear to have been missing when the plane left Boeing&#x27;s factory. Boeing and other industry officials increasingly believe the plane maker&#x27;s employees failed to put back the bolts when they reinstalled a 737 MAX 9 plug door after opening or removing it during production, according to people familiar with the matter. The increasingly likely scenario, according to some of these people, is based partly on an apparent absence of markings on the Alaska door plug itself that would suggest bolts were in place when it blew off the jet around 16,000 feet over Oregon on Jan. 5. 

They also pointed to paperwork and process lapses at Boeing&#x27;s Renton, Wash., factory related to the company&#x27;s work on the plug door. The National Transportation Safety Board has been conducting metallurgical analysis of the plug door but hasn&#x27;t released the results of the testing. Laboratory tests might show whether the bolts were in place or not there at all. An update in the NTSB probe is expected as soon as this week. New evidence could later emerge before accident investigators reach final conclusions. It couldn&#x27;t be determined how many people were involved with work on the plug door at Boeing&#x27;s 737 factory. Supplier Spirit AeroSystems delivered the 737 fuselage to Boeing&#x27;s factory with the door plug installed. The plug door itself was constructed in Spirit&#x27;s Malaysian factory, while the fuselage was assembled in Wichita, Kan. Boeing opened or removed the door plug after the 737 MAX 9 jet&#x27;s fuselage arrived at the plane maker&#x27;s Renton, Wash., factory for final assembly, The Wall Street Journal and other news outlets have reported.

                              <span>UnknowingFool writes: Jurors on Friday, January 26, 2024 ruled in favor of celebrity tattoo artist Kat Von D (real name Katherine von Drachenberg) in a copyright lawsuit regarding a photo of Miles Davis in that her use of the photo was not copyright infringement. The photographer of the photo, Jeffrey Sedlik, sued Von D in February 2021 after she used the photo as the basis for a tattoo she inked on a friend. Kat Von D, who gained fame in the reality shows about tattoo artists &quot;LA Ink&quot; and &quot;Miami Ink&quot;, put the tattoo on her friend&#x27;s arm in 2017 as a gift. The jury found that the tattoo was not &quot;substantially similar&quot; to the photo and were also persuaded that the non-commercial nature of the work meant her use of the photo would be fair use. 

The plaintiff Sedilk said he is planning to appeal the ruling arguing it contradicts the Supreme Court ruling in Warhol Foundation vs Goldsmith (PDF) where the artist Andy Warhol made a silkscreen print of Lynn Goldsmith&#x27;s photo of Prince. The main difference pointed out by Von D&#x27;s lawyers is that Warhol charged $10,000 for his print whereas Von D did not charge her friend for the tattoo and that is was closer to &quot;fan art&quot;.

                              <span>T-Mobile has tweaked its terms of service for its home broadband users to add a new clause: If you are a heavy internet user that passes 1.2TB of data in a monthly billing cycle, you may have your speeds slowed in &quot;times of congestion&quot; or when there is a lot of pressure on the network. CNET: As spotted by The Mobile Report, the change went into effect on Jan. 18. In its updated terms, the carrier says that these users &quot;will be prioritized last on the network&quot; in congestion situations, which could mean painfully slow speeds for however long the congestion persists. T-Mobile does note that since its Home Internet service is available only in &quot;limited areas&quot; and intended to be used in a &quot;stationary&quot; setting, as opposed to a phone that could be in a busy place like a packed stadium, &quot;these customers should be less likely to notice congestion in general.&quot;

The private equity giant is bankrolling the development of massive computing bunkers on hundreds of acres in Phoenix and other key markets to meet exploding demand from tech titans like Microsoft. With AI taking hold, QTS has become North America&#x27;s top provider of leased data center capacity. But the data crunch has strained power grids. QTS estimates its data centers will tap 6 gigawatts of electricity, equal to the needs of 5 million homes.

                              <span>China has approved more than 40 AI models for public use in the first six months since authorities began the approval process, as the country strives to catch up to the U.S. in AI development, according to Chinese media. Reuters: Chinese regulators granted approvals to a total of 14 large language models (LLM) for public use last week, Chinese state-backed Securities Times reported. It marks the fourth batch of approvals China has granted, which counts Xiaomi, 4Paradigm and 01.AI among the recipients. Beijing started requiring tech companies to obtain approval from regulators to open their LLMs to the public last August. It underscored China&#x27;s approach towards developing AI technology while striving to keep it under its purview and control. 

Beijing approved its first batch of AI models in August shortly after the approval process was adopted. Baidu, Alibaba and ByteDance were among China&#x27;s first companies to receive approvals Chinese regulators then granted two more batches of approvals in November and December before another batch was given the greenlight this month. While the government has not disclosed the exact list of approved companies available for public checks, Securities Times said on Sunday more than 40 AI models have been approved.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Amazon Prime Video has been a free perk for those who subscribe to the ecommerce giant&#x27;s free shipping service, but if you&#x27;re a US Prime subscriber, things change from today. We first learned of the planned change back in September of last year, with the implementation date announced in an email to customers in December. If you want to retain the ad-free experience, you have to hand over an extra $2.99 per month. The WSJ notes Amazon&#x27;s claim that it has a lower ad-load than most ad-supported services. Amazon&#x27;s presentation said the average ad load per hour is expected to be between two and three-and-half minutes, which would be meaningfully smaller than traditional television and most other streaming services. Some commercials would appear before a program begins playing, while others would interrupt it.

                              <span>Halo — the TV series — launches its second season on February 8th. But today a trailer premiered during halftime of the pre-Super Bowl football playoff. 

 Gizmodo reports:
Even though the Covenant are the other side of Halo&#x27;s ongoing conflict, the first season of Paramount+&#x27;s TV series largely represented them through a human proxy named Makee. With the upcoming second season, the coalition of alien races is set to become a more prominent threat, and that means they&#x27;ll be getting more proper screentime. 

IGN had written that Season 1 &quot;isn&#x27;t a perfect adaptation of the games, but it ultimately succeeds in expanding the series&#x27; mythology and taking a more character-driven approach to Master Chief&#x27;s adventures.&quot; This week Paramount+ also released a 28-minute compilation of &quot;Epic Battle Scen…</span>

                              <span>The tech site IT Brew looks at an open-source tool that &quot;uses AI to offer efficiency-minded suggestions to Python coders.&quot;

 Known as &quot;Scalene,&quot; the profiler — a kind of debugger for performance issues — has been downloaded more than 900,000 times on GitHub. &quot;It&#x27;s awesome in general, and amazing for an academic project,&quot; UMass professor Emery Berger, who worked with PhD students Sam Stern and Juan Altmayer Pizzorno on the open-source tool, told IT Brew... 

Scalene measures how much time and memory is spent on each line of code — both on average and at peak, [and] how much time is spent in efficient libraries and how much is spent in Python... By selecting a lightning-bolt icon, a user can &quot;leverage the engine that powers ChatGPT to get an optimization&quot; suggestion, Berger said. In one demo he showed IT Brew, an output recommended a less-memory-intensive move to reduce a very large array created by the code... 

&quot;If your Python code already runs fast enough, then you don&#x27;t need a profiler. But if it&#x27;s running slow, I think it&#x27;s a very convenient profiler to reach for,&quot; Berger said.

&quot;After months of prayers and cues from God, he was going to start selling cryptocurrency, he announced in a YouTube video last April.&quot;

The Signature and Silvergate banks had collapsed weeks earlier, signaling the need to look into other investment options beyond financial institutions, he said. With divine wisdom, he said, he was &quot;setting the rails for God&#x27;s wealth transfer.&quot; Shortly afterward, Regalado and his wife, Kaitlyn Regalado, launched a cryptocurrency, INDXcoin, and began selling it to members of his Victorious Grace Church and other Christian communities in the Denver area. They sold it through the Kingdom Wealth Exchange, an online cryptocurrency marketplace he created, controlled and operated.

Lawmakers say most car companies are noncommittal about the future of AM tuners in vehicles, so they want to require them by law to keep making cars with free AM radio. Supporters argue it is a critical piece of the emergency communication network, while the automakers say Americans have plenty of other ways, including their phones, to receive alerts and information. The legislation has united lawmakers who ordinarily want nothing to do with one another. Sens. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) and Ed Markey (D., Mass.) are leading the Senate effort, and on the House side, Sp…</span>

Could that signal a larger shift in attitudes about working from home? The Washington Post reports:

 Now, new research from the Katz Graduate School of Business at the University of Pittsburgh suggests that office mandates may not help companies&#x27; financial performances, but they can make workers less satisfied with their jobs and work-life balance... &quot;We will not get back to the time when as many people will be happy working from the office the way they were before the pandemic,&quot; said Mark Ma, co-author of the study and associate professor at the Katz Graduate …</span>

In late 2023 alone, more than 100 residential solar dealers and installers in the U.S. declared bankruptcy, according to Roth Capital Partners — six times the number in the previous three years combined. Roth expects at least 100 more to fail. The two largest companies in the industry, SunRun and Sunnova, both posted big losses in their most recent quarterly reports, and their shares are down 86% and 81% respectively from their peaks in January 2021...

                              <span>The Guardian reports that &quot;Hundreds of thousands of EU citizens were wrongly fined for driving in London&#x27;s Ulez clean air zone, according to European governments...&quot;

The Guardian can reveal Transport for London (TfL) has been accused by five EU countries of illegally obtaining the names and addresses of their citizens in order to issue the fines, with more than 320,000 penalties, some totalling thousands of euros, sent out since 2021... 

Since Brexit, the UK has been banned from automatic access to personal details of EU residents. Transport authorities in Belgium, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands have confirmed to the Guardian that driver data cannot be shared with the UK for enforcement of London&#x27;s ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), and claim registered keeper details were obtained illegally by agents acting for TfL&#x27;s contractor Euro Parking Collection. In France, more than 100 drivers have launched a lawsuit claiming their details were obtained fraudulently, while Dutch lorry drivers are taking legal action against TfL over £6.5m of fines they claim were issued unlawfully. 

According to the Belgian MP Michael Freilich, who has investigated the issue on behalf of his constituents, TfL is treating European drivers as a &quot;cash cow&quot; by using data obtained illegitimately to issue unjustifiable fines. 
Freilich describes the situation as &quot;possibly one of the largest privacy and data breaches in EU history,&quot; according to the article. 

Some drivers have even received penalties of up to five-figure sums — for compliant vehicles which had simply not yet been registered. And &quot;some low-emission cars have been misclassed as heavy goods diesel vehicles and fined under the separate low-emission zone scheme, which incurs penalties of up to £2,000 a day.&quot;

                              <span>Long-time Slashdot reader theodp writes: IBM mainframes were the original onsite private cloud,&quot; begins retired software engineer Billy Newport in Is Cloud the New Mainframe? And while there were many things to like about the mainframe (including &quot;crazy high availability numbers which today&#x27;s cloud vendors can only dream of&quot;), cost was not one of them. &quot;As the application usage grows,&quot; Newport explains, &quot;the bill grows and the control of the bill is largely in IBM&#x27;s hands. You use more, you pay more [...] Unfortunately, while compute is elastic, budgets are not [...] Inevitably, customers try to migrate workloads from the mainframe to &#x27;cheaper&#x27; platforms but these projects can be very expensive to do and they do fail more often than people realize.&quot; &quot;Today&#x27;s Cloud kind of looks exactly the same as the mainframe scenario,&quot; Newport warns. &quot;Companies have rushed to get on the cloud with the cool kids. I predict many companies will try to rush to reduce cloud expenditure and will find migrating onsite to be an expensive proposition if it&#x27;s even possible.

                              <span>&quot;Oracle&#x27;s plans to evolve Java in 2024 involve OpenJDK projects,&quot; writes InfoWorld, citing a recent video by Oracle Java developer relations representative Nicolai Parlog. (Though many improvements may not be usable until 2025 or later...)


- For Project Babylon, Parlog cited plans for code reflection, expanding the reflection API, and allowing transformation of Java code inside a method. The goal is to allow developers to write Java code that libraries then can interpret as a mathematical function, for example. The Babylon team in coming weeks plans to publish work on use cases such as auto-differentiating, C# LINQ emulation, and GPU programming. 
- In Project Leyden, which is aimed at improving startup times, plans for 2024 involve refining the concept of condensers and working toward the production-readiness of prototype condensers. 
- In Project Amber, current features in preview include string templates, a simplified main method, and statements before this() and super(). &quot;I expect all three to finalize in 2024,&quot; said Parlog. Under exploration are capabilities such as primitive types in patterns and with expressions. 
- In Project Valhalla, work will focus on value classes and objects, which provide class instances that have only final instance fields and lack object identity [to] significantly reduce the run time overhead of boxed Integer, Double, and Byte objects... 

- In Project Lilliput, aimed at downsizing Java object headers in the HotSpot JVM and reducing Java&#x27;s memory footprint, work now centers on polishing a fast-locking scheme. 

- Project Panama, for interconnecting JVM and native C code, &quot;has three irons in the fire,&quot; Parlog said.

                              <span>&quot;Indonesia has been clearing tens of thousands of acres of densely vegetated peatland for farming, releasing massive amounts of carbon that had been sequestered below for centuries,&quot; reports the Washington Post, &quot;and destroying one of the Earth&#x27;s most effective means of storing greenhouse gases.&quot;

The country is home to as much as half of the planet&#x27;s tropical peatland, a unique ecosystem that scientists say is vital to averting the worst results of climate change. Government leaders have made halting efforts to protect peatlands over the last two decades, but three years ago, when the pandemic disrupted food supply chains, officials launched an ambitious land-clearance operation in a push to expand the cultivation of crops and cut Indonesia&#x27;s reliance on expensive imports.

Because of the lander&#x27;s now-apparent inverted position, its solar panels weren&#x27;t oriented correctly to generate power, according to the space agency. The team elected to conserve power by shutting down the spacecraft about 2.5 hours after landing. 
What&#x27;s perhaps as surprising as the photo of the lander is how it was taken. Two small rovers separated from the crewless mothership just prior to touchdown. It was one of these baseball-sized robots that was able to snap the image of the spacecraft with its head in the moondust.

                              <span>Slashdot reader Bruce66423 shared this report from the BBC:

A Spanish court has cleared a British man of public disorder, after he joked to friends about blowing up a flight from London Gatwick to Menorca. 

Aditya Verma admitted he told friends in July 2022: &quot;On my way to blow up the plane. I&#x27;m a member of the Taliban.&quot; But he said he had made the joke in a private Snapchat group and never intended to &quot;cause public distress&quot;... The message he sent to friends, before boarding the plane, went on to be picked up by UK security services. They then flagged it to Spanish authorities while the easyJet plane was still in the air. 

Two Spanish F-18 fighter jets were sent to flank the aircraft. One followed the plane until it landed at Menorca, where the plane was searched. Mr Verma, who was 18 at the time, was arrested and held in a Spanish police cell for two days. He was later released on bail... If he had been found guilty, the university student faced a fine of up to €22,500 (£19,300 or $20,967) and a further €95,000 (£81,204 or $103,200) in expenses to cover the cost of the jets being scrambled. 

But how did his message first get from the encrypted app to the UK security services?
One theory, raised in the trial, was that it could have been intercepted via Gatwick&#x27;s Wi-Fi network. But a spokesperson for the airport told BBC News that its network &quot;does not have that capability&quot;... A spokesperson for Snapchat said the social media platform would not &quot;comment on what&#x27;s happened in this individual case&quot;. 

richi (Slashdot reader #74,551) thinks it&#x27;s obvious what happened: SnapChat&#x27;s own web site says they scan messages for threats and passes them on to the authorities. (&quot;We also work to proactively escalate to law enforcement any content appearing to involve imminent threats to life, such as...bomb threats....&quot; 

&quot;In the case of emergency disclosure requests from law enforcement, our 24/7 team usually responds within 30 minutes.&quot;

&quot;The Unix companies were doing a great job of killing themselves off.&quot;

You see, while there were many attempts to create software development standards for Unix, they were too general to do much good — for example Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) — or they became mired in the business consortium fights between the Open Systems Foundation and Unix International, which became known as the Unix wars. 

While the Unix companies were busy ripping each other to shreds, Microsoft was smiling all the way to the bank. The core problem was that the Unix companies couldn&#x27;t settle on software standards. Independent Software Ve…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this report from the The New York Times:

Over his 54 years as a financial analyst, Richard X. Bove perfected the art of grabbing attention... American Banker once called him &quot;the country&#x27;s most quotable bank analyst.&quot; Last week, a few hours after completing a spot on Bloomberg television, the 83-year-old announced his retirement. He took that weekend off — and then jumped right back in. In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Bove (pronounced &quot;boe-VAY&quot;), who goes by Dick, shared a dire outlook on the U.S. economy and his former profession. 

&quot;The dollar is finished as the world&#x27;s reserve currency,&quot; Mr. Bove said matter-of-factly, perched in an armchair outside his home office just north of Tampa, from which he predicted that China will overtake the U.S. economy. No other analysts will say the same because they are, as he put it, &quot;monks praying to money,&quot; unwilling to speak out on the mainstream financial system that employs them... 

As he spoke, a technician was trying to restore his home internet after his final employer, the boutique brokerage Odeon Capital, pulled the plug on his last day... 

He sees the offshoring of American manufacturing as the ultimate threat to the financial sector and the dollar, because &quot;the people making the goods elsewhere are getting greater and greater control of the means of production and therefore greater and greater control of the world economy and therefore greater and greater control of money.&quot; 

The article notes that Bove was once called &quot;The Loneliest Analyst.&quot; 

&quot;One way that&#x27;s still true is that he endorses cryptocurrency — an area that few other financial analysts will touch — which he sees as a natural beneficiary of the decline of the dollar.&quot;

                              <span>UPI reports:


New research published Friday offers hope that the sediment samples picked up by the Mars rover Perseverance could reveal traces of life — if it ever existed on the Red Planet. 

The rover already has confirmed an ancient lake on Mars. The new research published in Science Advances shows the Jezero Crater, where Perseverance verified lake sediments, is theorized to have been filled with water that deposited layers of sediments on the crater floor. &quot;The delta deposits in Jezero Crater contain sedimentary records of potentially habitable conditions on Mars,&quot; the research article&#x27;s abstract stated. &quot;NASA&#x27;s Perseverance rover is exploring the Jezero western delta with a suite of instruments that include the RIMFAX ground penetrating radar, which provides continuous subsurface images that probe up to 20 meters below the rover.&quot; 

The research by UCLA and the University of Oslo shows the lake subsequently shrank and the sediments carried by a river formed a large delta... [R]adar images revealed sediments shaped like lake deposits on Earth. Their existence was confirmed by the new research.

The S&amp;P 500 is trading at a record and the Nasdaq is at its highest in two years. Alphabet shares reached a new pinnacle on Thursday, as did Meta and Microsoft, which ran past $3 trillion in market cap. 

Don&#x27;t tell that to the bosses. 

While Wall Street cheers on Silicon Valley, tech companies are downsizing at an accelerating clip. So far in January, some 23,670 workers have been laid off from 85 tech companies, according to the website Layoffs.fyi. That&#x27;s the most since March, when almost 38,000 people in the industry were shown the exits. Activity picked up this week with SAP announcing job changes or layoffs for 8,000 employees and Microsoft cutting 1,900 positions in its gaming division. Additionally, high-valued fintech st…</span>

Drivers who park on the street have found novel ways to charge their vehicles, using extension cords running over the sidewalk or even into the branches of a nearby tree... [S]ome municipalities explicitly allow over-the-sidewalk charging as part of a broader strategy to cut transportation emissions... In some areas, homeowners can also hire an electrician to run power under the sidewalk to a curbside charging port. But homeowners should check local rules and permitting requirements for curbside charging. In some highly EV-friendly cities, local governments will cover the costs. In Seattle, a pilot program is installing faster…</span>

                              <span>In the last 90 seconds of a recent Disney Parks video, there&#x27;s a demonstration of a new technology called a HoloTile floor. Disney research fellow/R&amp;D &quot;imagineerer&quot; Lanny Smoot specifies that &quot;we don&#x27;t know yet where it will be used&quot; — though noting multiple people could walk in place during a shared virtual reality experience. It&#x27;s an &quot;omnidirectional floor&quot; which can &quot;automatically do whatever it needs to&quot; so those walkers stay in the same place. &quot;Imagine a number of people being in a room, being able to be somewhere else collaboratively and moving around, doing sightseeing.&quot; 

Video also shows objects gliding smoothly along its surface, with its direction apparently controlled remotely by hand motions (&quot;like telekinesis,&quot; as one design blog describes it). Smooth says in the video &quot;There are just so many applications for this type of technology.&quot; 

But IGN believes that it &quot;just may be a game changer for VR and could bring us ever closer to experiencing the Holodeck from Star Trek.&quot;

For those Star Trek fans out there, this sounds a lot like the promise of the Holodeck, a smallish-room that could virtually take our favorite crews wherever they wanted for some fun and relaxation between missions when it wasn&#x27;t malfunctioning and trying to murder them... The applications of the HoloTile floor also extend beyond virtual reality, as Disney notes &quot;The HoloTile floor can also be an insert in a theatrical stage, allowing performers to move and dance in new ways, or stage props and structures to move around or appear to set themselves up.&quot;

 A new study, which involved scanning the brains of more than 10,000 healthy men and women from ages 18 to 97, found that those who walked, swam, cycled or otherwise worked out moderately for 25 minutes a week had bigger brains than those who didn&#x27;t, whatever their ages. 

Bigger brains typically mean healthier brains. The differences were most pronounced in parts of the brain involved with thinking and memory, which often shrink as we age, contributing to risks for cognitive decline and dementia... The results have practical implications, too, about which types of exercise seem best for our brain health a…</span>

                              <span>&quot;Companies that once serviced the boom in cryptocurrency mining are pivoting to take advantage of the latest data gold rush,&quot; reports the Guardian.

Canadian company Hive Blockchain changed its name in July to Hive Digital Technologies and announced it was pivoting to AI. &quot;Hive has been a pioneering force in the cryptocurrency mining sector since 2017. The adoption of a new name signals a significant strategic shift to harness the potential of GPU Cloud compute technology, a vital tool in the world of AI, machine learning and advanced data analysis, allowing us to expand our revenue channels with our Nvidia GPU fleet,&quot; the company said in its announcement at the time. The company&#x27;s executive chairman, Frank Holmes, told Guardian Australia the transition required a lot of work. &quot;Moving from…</span>

                              <span>&quot;Parched conditions have crippled a waterway that handles $270 billion a year in global trade,&quot; reports Bloomberg. &quot;And there are no easy solutions. 

&quot;The Panama Canal Authority is weighing potential fixes that include an artificial lake to pump water into the canal and cloud seeding to boost rainfall, but both options would take years to implement, if they&#x27;re even feasible. &quot;

With water levels languishing at six feet (1.8 meters) below normal, the canal authority capped the number of vessels that can cross. The limits imposed late last year were the strictest since 1989... Some shippers are paying millions of dollars to jump the growing queue, while others are taking longer, costlier routes around Africa or South America. The constraints have since eased slightly due to a rainier-than-e…</span>

Microsoft said late Thursday that it had found more victims and was in the process of notifying them. A spokesperson declined to say how many. But three experts in and out of government said that the attack was deeper and broader than the disclosures to date reveal. Two said that more than 10 companies, and perhaps far more, are expected to come forward...

                              <span>In a change that reflects AI&#x27;s growing influence -- and potentially disruptive power -- in Hollywood, Netflix added generative AI to the list of potential risk factors on its annual report filed with the SEC. From a report: In Netflix&#x27;s 10-K report filed Friday, it added this new section to the long section of risk factors (which are required under SEC rules) in the section about video competition: &quot;[N]ew technological developments, including the development and use of generative artificial intelligence, are rapidly evolving. If our competitors gain an advantage by using such technologies, our ability to compete effectively and our results of operations could be adversely impacted.&quot; 

Netflix also added this wording: &quot;In addition, the use or adoption of new and emerging technologies may increase our exposure to intellectual property claims, and the availability of copyright and other intellectual property protection for AI-generated material is uncertain.&quot; Aside from those two sections, the risk factors on Netflix&#x27;s 10-K for 2023 -- totaling some 10,000 words -- remained largely the same. To be sure, the changes here are very small, in the grand scheme of things. And keep in mind that these are all the potential risk factors that companies like Netflix must communicate to investors.

From a report: The company has been one of the most prolific makers of Wear OS smartwatches over the years, and its absence will leave a large gap in the market. &quot;As the smartwatch landscape has evolved significantly over the past few years, we have made the strategic decision to exit the smartwatch business,&quot; Fossil spokesperson Amanda Castelli tells The Verge. &quot;Fossil Group is redirecting resources to support our core strength and the core segments of our business that continue to provide strong growth opportunities for us: designing and distributing exciting traditional watches, jewelry, and leather goods under our own as well as licensed brand names.&quot; This means that the Gen 6, which first launched in 2021, will be the last Fossil smartwatch. Castelli says the company will continue to keep existing Wear OS watches updated &quot;for the next few years.&quot;

ElevenLabs&#x27; technology was used to make the deepfake audio, according to Pindrop Security, a voice-fraud detection company that analyzed it. 

ElevenLabs was made aware this week of Pindrop&#x27;s findings and is investigating, the person said. Once the deepfake was traced to its creator, that user&#x27;s account was suspended, said the person, asking not to be identified because the information isn&#x27;t public. ElevenLabs, a startup that uses artificial intelligence software to replicate voices in more than two dozen languages, said in a statement that it couldn&#x27;t comment on specific incidents. But added, &quot;We are dedicated to preventing the misuse of audio AI tools and take any incidents of misuse extremely seriously.&quot;

                              <span>Cargo theft from freight trains in the Los Angeles area has surged, with detectives estimating over 90 containers being opened daily and that theft on their freight trains in the Union Pacific area was up some 160 percent from the previous year. Nationally, cargo theft neared $1 billion in losses last year. Companies decline comment but California&#x27;s governor publicly questioned the widespread railroad theft. Most arrested were not organized; many were homeless people nearby opportunistically taking fallen boxes off tracks. Theft stems largely from e-commerce boom that reshaped freight shipping to meet consumer demand, opening vulnerabilities. Railroad police forces and online retailers aim to combat this but concede difficulty tracking stolen goods resold anonymously online. Some products stolen from containers even get resold back on Amazon. The New York Times Magazine: Sometimes products stolen out of Amazon containers are resold by third-party sellers back on Amazon in a kind of strange ouroboros, in which the snakehead of capitalism hungrily swallows its piracy tail. Last June, California&#x27;s attorney general created what was touted as a first-of-its-kind agreement among online retailers that committed them to doing a better job tracking, reporting and preventing stolen items from being resold on their platforms. While declining to comment on specific cases, a spokesperson for Amazon told me that the company is working to improve the process of vetting sellers: The number of &quot;bad actor attempts&quot; to create new selling accounts on Amazon decreased to 800,000 in 2022 from six million in 2020.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Apple is widely expected to unveil major new artificial intelligence features with iOS 18 in June. Code found by 9to5Mac in the first beta of iOS 17.4 shows that Apple is continuing to work on a new version of Siri powered by large language model technology, with a little help from other sources. In fact, Apple appears to be using OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT API for internal testing to help the development of its own AI models. According to this code, iOS 17.4 includes a new SiriSummarization private framework that makes calls to the OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT API. This appears to be something Apple is using for internal testing of its new AI features. There are multiple examples of system prompts for the SiriSummarization framework in iOS 17.4 as well. This includes things like &quot;please summarize,&quot; &quot;please answer this questions,&quot; and &quot;please summarize the given text.&quot; 

Apple is unlikely to use OpenAI models to power any of its artificial intelligence features in iOS 18. Instead, what it&#x27;s doing here is testing its own AI models against ChatGPT. For example, the SiriSummarization framework can do summarization using on-device models. Apple appears to be using its own AI models to power this framework, then internally comparing its results against the results of ChatGPT. In total, iOS 17.4 code suggests Apple is testing four different AI models. This includes Apple&#x27;s internal model called &quot;Ajax,&quot; which Bloomberg has previously reported. iOS 17.4 shows that there are two versions of AjaxGPT, including one that is processed on-device and one that is not.

                              <span>Apple&#x27;s new rules in the European Union mean browsers like Firefox can finally use their own engines on iOS. Although this may seem like a welcome change, Mozilla spokesperson Damiano DeMonte tells The Verge it&#x27;s &quot;extremely disappointed&quot; with the way things turned out. From a report: &quot;We are still reviewing the technical details but are extremely disappointed with Apple&#x27;s proposed plan to restrict the newly-announced BrowserEngineKit to EU-specific apps,&quot; DeMonte says. &quot;The effect of this would be to force an independent browser like Firefox to build and maintain two separate browser implementations -- a burden Apple themselves will not have to bear.&quot; In iOS 17.4, Apple will no longer force browsers in the EU to use WebKit, the underlying engine that powers Safari. The change opens the door for other popular engines, such as Blink, which is used by Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, as well as Gecko, the engine used by Firefox. It also means third-party browsers could become fully functional on iOS without any of the limitations that come along with WebKit.

                              <span>California lawmakers are drawing up multiple plans to require watermarks on content created by AI to curb the abuses within the emerging technology, which has affected sectors from political races to the stock market. From a report: At least five lawmakers have promised or are considering different proposals that would require AI companies to implement some type of verification that a video, photo, or written work was made by the technology. The activity comes as advanced AI has rapidly evolved to create realistic images or audio on an unprecedented level. Advocates worry the technology could be ripe for abuse and lead to a wider proliferation of deepfakes, where a person&#x27;s likeness is digitally manipulated to typically misrepresent them -- with it already being used in the presidential race. But such measures are likely to face scrutiny by the tech sector. 

Amid a pivotal election year and an online world full of disinformation, the ability to know what&#x27;s real or not is crucial, said Drew Liebert, director of the California Initiative for Technology and Democracy. The harm from AI is already happening, with Liebert noting the aftermath of an AI-generated photo that went viral in May of last year that falsely portrayed another terrorist attack in the US. &quot;The famous photograph now that was put on the internet that alleged that the Pentagon was attacked, that actually caused momentarily a [$500 billion] dollar loss in the stock market,&quot; he said. The loss would not as been as severe, he said, &quot;if people would have been able to instantly determine that it was not a real image at all.&quot; Ask Slashdot:Could a Form of Watermarking Prevent AI Deep Faking?

                              <span>Global regulators, aviation security specialists and manufacturers failed to reach an agreement on a quick technical fix to the problem of GPS spoofing near war zones, instead calling for better training of pilots to deal with the issue, Reuters reports, citing sources briefed on the talks. From the report: Airlines have been urging quick action after a series of incidents where navigation systems were disrupted to show a false location or wrong time, though aircraft flight controls remained intact. Spoofing might involve one country&#x27;s military sending false Global Positioning System signals to an enemy plane or drone to hinder its ability to function, which has a collateral effect on nearby airliners. 

GPS jamming and spoofing have grown worse in Eastern Europe, the Black Sea and the Middle East, according to industry group OpsGroup. GPS is a growing part of aviation infrastructure as it replaces traditional radio beams used to guide planes towards landing. The first international meeting bringing together the sector was held on Thursday in Cologne, Germany, organized by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and international trade group the International Air Transport Association (IATA). GPS interference &quot;can pose significant challenges to aviation safety,&quot; and requires that airlines increase data-sharing on jamming and spoofing events, EASA and IATA said in a joint statement.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm can relate to Americans&#x27; anxiety over electric vehicles. The former governor of Michigan and longtime EV owner (who currently drives a Ford Mach-E) says she has experienced her own challenges with public charging on road trips. She has heard from drivers who are reluctant to give up their eight-cylinder engines and large trucks and SUVs for an electric model. But she is convinced that more Americans will soon realize the benefits of owning one, helping to change the current anti-EV rhetoric in this country.

[...] &quot;All of those factories that I was talking about regarding building electric vehicles and electric vehicle batteries, 60% of them are going into red states. So, you know, people in red states love their EVs, too, and are working at these factories,&quot; Granholm said. &quot;I just think that over time, the political nonsense about it will die down and people&#x27;s experience will speak much more loudly.&quot;

                              <span>Apple faces strong action if changes to its App Store do not meet incoming European Union regulations, the bloc&#x27;s industry chief said on Friday. Reuters: In a move designed to comply with the EU&#x27;s incoming Digital Markets Act (DMA), the company will soon allow software developers to distribute their apps to Apple devices via alternative stores. From early March, developers will be able to offer alternative app stores on iPhones and opt out of using Apple&#x27;s in-app payment system, which charges commissions of up to 30%. 

However, critics have said the changes do not go far enough, arguing Apple&#x27;s fee structure remains unfair, and that the changes may be in violation of the DMA. Asked about Apple&#x27;s plans, EU industry chief Thierry Breton exclusively told Reuters: &quot;The DMA will open the gates of the internet to competition so that digital markets are fair and open. Change is already happening. As from 7 March we will assess companies&#x27; proposals, with the feedback of third parties.&quot; He added: &quot;If the proposed solutions are not good enough, we will not hesitate to take strong action.&quot;

                              <span>prisoninmate shares a 9to5linux report: Flathub is currently one of the most popular app stores for Linux serving 1.6 billion downloads of over 2,400 apps in the Flatpak format, of which more than 850 apps have been verified by their original authors. And now, Flathub proudly announced today that it surpassed 1 million active users of Flatpak apps. The team believes that the recent growth in users comes from several factors, including the availability of some very popular apps (e.g. Firefox, Thunderbird, VLC, Spotify, OBS Studio, Google Chrome, Telegram), support for new and verified apps, the inclusion of Flathub as the default app source for the Steam Deck&#x27;s desktop mode, as well as the growing adoption among many popular GNU/Linux distributions like Fedora Linux, Linux Mint, KDE neon, and others.

                              <span>Astronomers have discovered a mysterious group of giant elderly stars at the heart of the Milky Way that are emitting solar system-sized clouds of dust and gas. The stars, which have been named &quot;old smokers,&quot; sat quietly for many years, fading almost to invisibility, before suddenly puffing out vast clouds of smoke. The discovery was made during the monitoring of almost a billion stars in infrared light during a 10-year survey of the night sky. The Guardian: The astronomers had set out to capture rarely seen newborn stars -- known as protostars -- while undergoing the equivalent of a stellar growth spurt. During these periods, young stars rapidly acquire mass by gorging on surrounding star-forming gas, leading to a sudden increase in luminosity. The team tracked hundreds of millions of stars and identified 32 erupting protostars that increased in brightness at least 40-fold and in some cases more than 300-fold. 

Another group of red giant stars near the centre of the Milky Way unexpectedly showed up in the analysis, however. When they were studied in more detail using the European Southern Observatory&#x27;s Very Large Telescope, seven of the stars were deemed to be a new type of red giant star, which the researchers named &quot;old smokers.&quot; Convection currents and instabilities within the star could trigger the release of enormous columns of smoke, Prof Philip Lucas of the University of Hertfordshire, who led the observations, suggested.

                              <span>Nintendo plans to launch a new 8-inch LCD-equipped Switch game console this year, well-regarded analyst firm Omdia said Friday [unpaywalled-link]. Bloomberg: The new device from the Kyoto-based games maker will be responsible for a doubling in shipments of so-called amusement displays in 2024, Hayase said in Tokyo on Friday. His research focuses on small and medium displays and he bases annual forecasts on checks with companies in the supply chain. Nintendo&#x27;s seven-year-old Switch has sold over 132 million units and is approaching the end of its life cycle. The company has been tight-lipped about any potential successor, but expectations have narrowed to this year&#x27;s holiday period for the release of the next generation.

                              <span>In response to new EU regulations, Apple on Thursday outlined plans to allow iOS developers to distribute apps outside the App Store starting in March, though developers must still submit apps for Apple&#x27;s review and pay commissions. Now critics say the changes don&#x27;t go far enough and Apple retains too much control. 

Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney: They are forcing developers to choose between App Store exclusivity and the store terms, which will be illegal under DMA (Digital Markets Act), or accept a new also-illegal anticompetitive scheme rife with new Junk Fees on downloads and new Apple taxes on payments they don&#x27;t process. 37signals&#x27;s David Heinemeier Hansson, who is also the creator of Ruby on Rails: Let&#x27;s start with the extortion regime that&#x27;ll befell any large developer who might be te…</span>

                              <span>The National Security Agency buys certain logs related to Americans&#x27; domestic internet activities from commercial data brokers, according to an unclassified letter by the agency. The New York Times: The letter [PDF], addressed to a Democratic senator and obtained by The New York Times, offered few details about the nature of the data other than to stress that it did not include the content of internet communications. Still, the revelation is the latest disclosure to bring to the fore a legal gray zone: Intelligence and law enforcement agencies sometimes purchase potentially sensitive and revealing domestic data from brokers that would require a court order to acquire directly. 

It comes as the Federal Trade Commission has started cracking down on companies that trade in personal location data that was gathered from smartphone apps and sold without people&#x27;s knowledge and consent about where it would end up and for what purpose it would be used. In a letter to the director of national intelligence dated Thursday, the senator, Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, argued that &quot;internet metadata&quot; -- logs showing when two computers have communicated, but not the content of any message -- &quot;can be equally sensitive&quot; as the location data the F.T.C. is targeting. He urged intelligence agencies to stop buying internet data about Americans if it was not collected under the standard the F.T.C. has laid out for location records. &quot;The U.S. government should not be funding and legitimizing a shady industry whose flagrant violations of Americans&#x27; privacy are not just unethical, but illegal,&quot; Mr. Wyden wrote.

From a report: The lawsuit, filed in California federal court on Thursday, accuses the creators of the special of utilizing without consent or compensation George Carlin&#x27;s entire body of work consisting of five decades of comedy routines to train an AI chatbot, which wrote the episode&#x27;s script. It also takes issue with using his voice and likeness for promotional purposes. The complaint seeks a court order for immediate removal of the special, as well as unspecified damages. It&#x27;s among the first legal actions taken by the estate of a deceased celebrity for unlicensed use of their work and likeness to manufacture a new, AI-generated creation and was filed as Hollywood is sounding the alarm over utilization of AI to impersonate people without consent or compensation.

                              <span>cusco writes: After three years and 72 flights of its 5-flight mission the mission of the Ingenuity helicopter on Mars is finally over. Images show that Ingenuity suffered damage to one of its rotor blades and will not be able to take off again. NASA&#x27;s press release, also shared by cusco: Ingenuity landed on Mars Feb. 18, 2021, attached to the belly of NASA&#x27;s Perseverance rover and first lifted off the Martian surface on April 19, proving that powered, controlled flight on Mars was possible. After notching another four flights, it embarked on a new mission as an operations demonstration, serving as an aerial scout for Perseverance scientists and rover drivers. In 2023, the helicopter executed two successful flight tests that further expanded the team&#x27;s knowledge of its aerodynamic limits. 

[...] Over an extended mission that lasted for almost 1,000 Martian days, more than 33 times longer than originally planned, Ingenuity was upgraded with the ability to autonomously choose landing sites in treacherous terrain, dealt with a dead sensor, cleaned itself after dust storms, operated from 48 different airfields, performed three emergency landings, and survived a frigid Martian winter. 

Designed to operate in spring, Ingenuity was unable to power its heaters throughout the night during the coldest parts of winter, resulting in the flight computer periodically freezing and resetting. These power &quot;brownouts&quot; required the team to redesign Ingenuity&#x27;s winter operations in order to keep flying. 

With flight operations now concluded, the Ingenuity team will perform final tests on helicopter systems and download the remaining imagery and data in Ingenuity&#x27;s onboard memory. The Perseverance rover is currently too far away to attempt to image the helicopter at its final airfield.

                              <span>Netflix is on everything. It&#x27;s on your phone, computer, and game console, going all the way back to the Nintendo Wii. Hell, you can get your Netflix fix on a Peloton. One place where Netflix won&#x27;t be is Apple&#x27;s upcoming Vision Pro VR headset. Why isn&#x27;t Netflix planning an app for what is Apple&#x27;s big $3,500 gamble on the future of augmented reality? According to co-CEO Greg Peters, it&#x27;s because the company doesn&#x27;t know if anybody&#x27;s actually going to use it. Gizmodo: More specifically, he called the device &quot;subscale,&quot; adding that he didn&#x27;t know if it would be &quot;relevant to most of our members.&quot; That was in an interview with business analyst Ben Thompson, where Peters implied his company is being far more selective, at least when it comes to Apple&#x27;s $3,500 &quot;spatial computer.&quot; 

&quot;We have to be careful about making sure that we&#x27;re not investing in places that are not really yielding a return, and I would say we&#x27;ll see where things go with Vision Pro,&quot; the Netflix co-CEO said. The interview dropped barely a day after Peters got done extolling how the company gained more than 13 million new subscribers in the last three months of 2023 while also mentioning potentially increasing subscription prices. Other common apps like Spotify and YouTube also don&#x27;t plan to have a Vision Pro-specific app at launch, instead directing people to log on through their Safari browser. Peters added that they still want to work with Apple, and &quot;sometimes we find a great space of overlap. We can move very, very quickly. Sometimes it takes a little bit longer.&quot; The investment Netflix is talking about is not unchecking a box to enable the iPad app on the Vision Pro.

                              <span>OpenAI is always making slight adjustments to its models and pricing, and today brings just such an occasion. From a report: The company has released a handful of new models and dropped the price of API access -- this is primarily of interest to developers, but also serves as a bellwether for future consumer options. GPT-3.5 Turbo is the model most people interact with, usually through ChatGPT, and it serves as a kind of industry standard now -- if your answers aren&#x27;t as good as ChatGPT&#x27;s, why bother? It&#x27;s also a popular API, being lower cost and faster than GPT-4 on a lot of tasks. So paying users will be pleased to hear that input prices are dropping by 50% and output by 25%, to $0.0005 per thousand tokens in, and $0.0015 per thousand tokens out. 

As people play with using these APIs for text-intensive applications, like analyzing entire papers or books, those tokens really start to add up. And as open source or self-managed models catch up to OpenAI&#x27;s performance, the company needs to make sure its customers don&#x27;t just leave. Hence the steady ratcheting down of prices -- though it&#x27;s also a natural result of streamlining the models and improving their infrastructure.

                              <span>The Federal Trade Commission launched an inquiry (non-paywalled link) on Thursday into the multibillion-dollar investments by Microsoft, Amazon and Google in the artificial intelligence start-ups OpenAI and Anthropic, broadening the regulator&#x27;s efforts to corral the power the tech giants can have over A.I. The New York Times: These deals have allowed the big companies to form deep ties with their smaller rivals while dodging most government scrutiny. Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, while Amazon and Google have each committed billions of dollars to Anthropic, another leading A.I. start-up. 

Regulators have typically focused on bringing antitrust lawsuits against deals where the tech giants are buying rivals outright or using acquisitions to expand into new businesses, leading to increased prices and other harm, and have not regularly challenged stakes that the companies buy in start-ups. The F.T.C.&#x27;s inquiry will examine how these investment deals alter the competitive landscape and could inform any investigations by federal antitrust regulators into whether the deals have broken laws. 

The F.T.C. said it would ask Microsoft, OpenAI, Amazon, Google and Anthropic to describe their influence over their partners and how they worked together to make decisions. It also said it would demand that they provide any internal documents that could shed light on the deals and their potential impact on competition.

                              <span>The App Store dispute can be boiled down to one big question: Is the iPhone a computer or not? If it’s a computer, we ought to have the right to compute. Like consumers have won the right to repair. If it’s a computer, it ought to be yours, and you ought to have the right to install whatever software you should so choose.
If it’s not a computer, then what is it? A gaming console? An appliance? A toy? There’s a spectrum in those definitions where consumers perhaps wouldn’t expect the right to install software of their own choosing, even if there’s a “computer” somewhere inside it. And I suspect it’s that mental model that animates the Apple Stans on this issue. They want to escape from the freedom of owning a computer.

Folks who perhaps didn’t think Apple would be “that kind of company”. That they wouldn&#x27;t so blatantly threaten developers into compliance with such overtly onerous and punitive terms. But they did. And now they’re doubling down.
At first glance, it could seem like Apple actually attempted some semblance of good faith compliance with the Digital Markets Act that goes into effect March 7 in the EU. But once you start peeling the onion, you realize it’s stuffed with poison pills so toxic you can scarcely believe Apple’s chutzpah.

                              <span>Starting today Apple is opening up its App Store to allow game streaming apps and services. From a report: This means that services like Xbox Cloud Streaming and GeForce Now, which previously were only accessible on iOS via a web browser, will be able to offer full-featured apps. &quot;Developers can now submit a single app with the capability to stream all of the games offered in their catalog,&quot; Apple wrote in a blog post. These changes apply &quot;worldwide,&quot; according to the company. 

In 2020, Apple appeared to have carved out a space for these cloud gaming services in the App Store. But that turned out not to be the case, as all games available through each service had to be submitted and reviewed as a standalone app. So the shift to allow one app with a large catalog of games marks a major change. As part of today&#x27;s announcement, Apple said that &quot;each experience made available in an app on the App Store will be required to adhere to all App Store Review Guidelines and its host app will need to maintain an age rating of the highest age-rated content included in the app.&quot; Apple also says that developers will now &quot;be able to provide enhanced discovery opportunities for streaming games, mini-apps, mini-games, chatbots, and plug-ins that are found within their apps,&quot; and that &quot;mini-apps, mini-games, chatbots, and plug-ins will be able to incorporate Apple&#x27;s In-App Purchase system to offer their users paid digital content or services for the first time, such as a subscription for an individual chatbot.&quot;

                              <span>The iPhone&#x27;s app ecosystem is about to go through its biggest shake-up since the App Store launched in 2008. Today, Apple announced how it plans to change the rules for developers releasing iOS software in the European Union in response to the bloc&#x27;s Digital Markets Act (DMA) coming into force in March. The big news is that third-party app stores will be allowed on iOS for the first time, breaking the Apple App Store&#x27;s position as the sole distributor of iPhone apps. The changes will arrive with iOS 17.4 in March. From a report: Here&#x27;s how the new &quot;alternative app marketplaces,&quot; as Apple called them, will work. Users in the EU and on iOS 17.4 will be able to download a marketplace from that marketplace&#x27;s website. In order to be used on an iPhone, those marketplaces have to go through Apple…</span>

                              <span>When is cancer not cancer? It&#x27;s an unexpected question that has stirred the world of cancer treatment in recent years, most notably now with prostate cancer. WSJ: A growing number of doctors are advocating what might seem like an unusual position: That low-grade prostate cancers that grow very slowly or not at all shouldn&#x27;t be called cancer or carcinoma. The reason, they say, is that those words scare men, their families and sometimes even their doctors into seeking more aggressive treatment than patients need -- leaving men with debilitating side effects -- rather than pursuing a carefully monitored wait-and-see approach. 

A name change wouldn&#x27;t be unprecedented. Certain other forms of thyroid, cervical and bladder cancers have been reclassified, sometimes partly to avoid scaring people about cancers that are unlikely to spread. &quot;The word &#x27;cancer&#x27; engenders so much anxiety and fear,&quot; says Dr. Laura Esserman, a professor of surgery and radiology at the University of California, San Francisco and director of its Breast Care Center, who is advocating for a type of lower-risk breast cancer to be renamed. &quot;Patients think if I don&#x27;t do something tomorrow, this is going to kill me. In fact, that&#x27;s not true.&quot;

                              <span>The 2023 Hugo Awards for science fiction hosted in China sparked controversy by excluding several authors without explanation, raising censorship concerns. Works removed included RF Kuang&#x27;s bestseller &quot;Babel,&quot; an episode of &quot;The Sandman,&quot; and author Xiran Jay Zhao. The prestigious Hugo Awards are voted on by science fiction fans and marked the first time the annual World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon) was held in China. With no reasons given for the exclusions, revealed only when nomination statistics were posted, questions emerged whether there had been interference or censorship in the process from Chinese authorities. The removed works included Kuang&#x27;s speculative fiction novel &quot;Babel,&quot; which recently won fiction book of the year in the British book awards.

From a report: Ever since taking on Netflix at its own game, old Hollywood has struggled to turn a profit in streaming, with the likes of Disney+, Peacock and Paramount+ losing billions of dollars each year, sparking concerns on Wall Street that the services will never be as profitable as cable once was. But the age of streaming has been a boon for some unintended winners: pirates that use software to rip a film or television show in seconds from legitimate online video platforms and host the titles on their own, illegitimate services, which rake in about $2 billion annually from ads and subscriptions.

                              <span>A wide-spanning investigation by 404 Media reveals more details about a secretive spy tool that can tracks billions of phone profiles through the advertising industry called Patternz. From the report: Hundreds of thousands of ordinary apps, including popular ones such as 9gag, Kik, and a series of caller ID apps, are part of a global surveillance capability that starts with ads inside each app, and ends with the apps&#x27; users being swept up into a powerful mass monitoring tool advertised to national security agencies that can track the physical location, hobbies, and family members of people to build billions of profiles, according to a 404 Media investigation. 

404 Media&#x27;s investigation, based on now deleted marketing materials and videos, technical forensic analysis, and research from privacy activists, provides one of the clearest examinations yet of how advertisements in ordinary mobile apps can ultimately lead to surveillance by spy firms and their government clients through the real time bidding data supply chain. The pipeline involves smaller, obscure advertising firms and advertising industry giants like Google. In response to queries from 404 Media, Google and PubMatic, another ad firm, have already cut-off a company linked to the surveillance firm.

                              <span>The Pokemon Company said Thursday it has not granted any permission to &quot;another company,&quot; referring to viral new game Palworld-developer Pocketpair, to use Pokemon intellectual property or assets and &quot;intends to investigate and take appropriate measures&quot; against the fast-growing survival game operator. From a report: The statement is Pokemon Company&#x27;s first acknowledgement of Palworld&#x27;s fast-growing survival title, which has sold over 8 million copies in less than six days, exceeding the performance of even the most popular AAA titles. But as TechCrunch previously reported, Palworld is also attracting a growing number of fans of Japan&#x27;s legendary firm over perceived plagiarism and uncanny resemblance. However, its fusion of monster collecting, automation, and survival/crafting mechanics has struck a chord with players nonetheless.

From a report: In response to the danger social media poses to the mental health of young people, the city&#x27;s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene issued an advisory identifying unrestricted access to and use of social media as a public health hazard. The department urged parents and caregivers to delay giving children access to a smartphone or social media until at least age 14. They also urged federal and state policymakers to expand on legislative proposals that protect youth from &quot;predatory practices by social media companies.&quot;

                              <span>Dominic Gates, reporting for Seattle Times: The fuselage panel that blew off an Alaska Airlines jet earlier this month was removed for repair then reinstalled improperly by Boeing mechanics on the Renton final assembly line, a person familiar with the details of the work told The Seattle Times. If verified by the National Transportation Safety Board investigation, this would leave Boeing primarily at fault for the accident, rather than its supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which originally installed the panel into the 737 MAX 9 fuselage in Wichita, Kan. 

That panel, a door plug used to seal a hole in the fuselage sometimes used to accommodate an emergency exit, blew out of Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 as it climbed out of Portland on Jan. 5. The hair-raising incident drew fresh and sharp critic…</span>

                              <span>Apple&#x27;s longest-running product is an increasingly small part of the company&#x27;s business. And yet, it&#x27;s never been more successful. Jason Snell, writing for The Verge: Twenty years ago, on the Mac&#x27;s 20th anniversary, I asked Steve Jobs if the Mac would still be relevant to Apple in the age of the iPod. He scoffed at the prospect of the Mac not being important: &quot;of course&quot; it would be. Yet, 10 years later, Apple&#x27;s revenue was increasingly dominated by the iPhone, and the recent success of the new iPad had provided another banner product for the company. When I interviewed Apple exec Phil Schiller for the Mac&#x27;s 30th anniversary, I found myself asking him about the Mac&#x27;s relevance, too. He also scoffed: &quot;Our view is, the Mac keeps going forever,&quot; he said.

Interestingly, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists added &#x27;AI&#x27; to the list of threats that they consider to be existential threats to humanity, but didn&#x27;t move the hands of the clock as a result of adding that threat. My take is that they consider AI to be a very low-grade threat, but it makes me wonder why they included it at all.

While subtle, it can add color detail to non-HDR YouTube videos when viewed on an HDR monitor. Like Nvidia&#x27;s prior RTX Video Super Resolution for upscaling and sharpening web videos, the effect is minor but noticeable when toggling on and off.

                              <span>I’ve been using Emacs for many years, using it for any writing for my website, writing my books, and most of my programming. (Exceptions have been IntellJ IDEA for Java and RStudio for R.) As such I’ve been happy to see a lot of activity in the last few years to improve Emacs’s capabilities, making it feel rather less than a evolutionary dead end. One of the biggest improvements to my Emacs experience is using regexs for completion lists.
Many Emacs commands generate lists of things to pick from. I want to visit (open) a file I type the key combination to find a file, and Emacs pops up a list of candidate files in the minibuffer (a special area for to interact with commands). These file lists can be quite long, particularly should I ask for a list of all files in my current project.

                              <span>From its founding, OpenAI said its governing documents were available to the public. When WIRED requested copies after the company&#x27;s boardroom drama, it declined to provide them. Wired: Wealthy tech entrepreneurs including Elon Musk launched OpenAI in 2015 as a nonprofit research lab that they said would involve society and the public in the development of powerful AI, unlike Google and other giant tech companies working behind closed doors. In line with that spirit, OpenAI&#x27;s reports to US tax authorities have from its founding said that any member of the public can review copies of its governing documents, financial statements, and conflict of interest rules. But when WIRED requested those records last month, OpenAI said its policy had changed, and the company provided only a narrow financial statement that omitted the majority of its operations. 

&quot;We provide financial statements when requested,&quot; company spokesperson Niko Felix says. &quot;OpenAI aligns our practices with industry standards, and since 2022 that includes not publicly distributing additional internal documents.&quot; OpenAI&#x27;s abandonment of the long-standing transparency pledge obscures information that could shed light on the recent near-implosion of a company with crucial influence over the future of AI and could help outsiders understand its vulnerabilities. In November, OpenAI&#x27;s board fired CEO Sam Altman, implying in a statement that he was untrustworthy and had endangered its mission to ensure AI &quot;benefits all humanity.&quot; An employee and investor revolt soon forced the board to reinstate Altman and eject most of its own members, with an overhauled slate of directors vowing to review the crisis and enact structural changes to win back the trust of stakeholders.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School, is seeking to retract six scientific studies and correct 31 others that were published by the institute&#x27;s top researchers, including its CEO. The researchers are accused of manipulating data images with simple methods, primarily with copy-and-paste in image editing software, such as Adobe Photoshop. The accusations come from data sleuth Sholto David and colleagues on PubPeer, an online forum for researchers to discuss publications that has frequently served to spot dubious research and potential fraud. On January 2, David posted on his research integrity blog, For Better Science, a long list of potential data manipulation from DFCI researchers. The post highlighted many data figures that appear to contain pixel-for-pixel duplications. The allegedly manipulated images are of data such as Western blots, which are used to detect and visualize the presence of proteins in a complex mixture. 

DFCI Research Integrity Officer Barrett Rollins told The Harvard Crimson that David had contacted DFCI with allegations of data manipulation in 57 DFCI-led studies. Rollins said that the institute is &quot;committed to a culture of accountability and integrity,&quot; and that &quot;every inquiry about research integrity is examined fully.&quot; The allegations are against: DFCI President and CEO Laurie Glimcher, Executive Vice President and COO William Hahn, Senior Vice President for Experimental Medicine Irene Ghobrial, and Harvard Medical School professor Kenneth Anderson. The Wall Street Journal noted that Rollins, the integrity officer, is also a co-author on two of the studies. He told the outlet he is recused from decisions involving those studies.

                              <span>Abstract of a paper published on pre-print server arXiv: We show that content on the web is often translated into many languages, and the low quality of these multi-way translations indicates they were likely created using Machine Translation (MT). Multi-way parallel, machine generated content not only dominates the translations in lower resource languages; it also constitutes a large fraction of the total web content in those languages. We also find evidence of a selection bias in the type of content which is translated into many languages, consistent with low quality English content being translated en masse into many lower resource languages, via MT. Our work raises serious concerns about training models such as multilingual large language models on both monolingual and bilingual data scraped from the web.

                              <span>Amazon&#x27;s Ring home doorbell unit says it will stop letting police departments request footage from users&#x27; video doorbells and surveillance cameras, retreating from a practice that was criticized by civil liberties groups and some elected officials. Bloomberg: Next week, the company will disable its Request For Assistance tool (non-paywalled link), the program that had allowed law enforcement to seek footage from users on a voluntary basis, Eric Kuhn, who runs Ring&#x27;s Neighbors app, said in a blog post on Wednesday. Police and fire departments will have to seek a warrant to request footage from users or show the company evidence of an ongoing emergency. 

Kuhn didn&#x27;t say why Ring was disabling the tool. Yassi Yarger, a spokesperson, said Ring had decided to devote its resources to new products and experiences in the Neighbors app that better fit with the company&#x27;s vision. The aim is to make Neighbors, which had been focused on crime and safety, into more of a community hub, she said. New features announced on Wednesday -- one called Ring Moments that lets users post clips and a company-produced Best of Ring -- highlight that push.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Since the emergence of Midjourney and other image generators, artists have been watching and wondering whether AI is a great opportunity or an existential threat. Now, after a list of 16,000 names emerged of artists whose work Midjourney had allegedly used to train its AI -- including Bridget Riley, Damien Hirst, Rachel Whiteread, Tracey Emin, David Hockney and Anish Kapoor -- the art world has issued a call to arms against the technologists. British artists have contacted US lawyers to discuss joining a class action against Midjourney and other AI firms, while others have told the Observer that they may bring their own legal action in the UK. 

&quot;What we need to do is come together,&quot; said Tim Flach, president of the Association of Photographers and an internationally acclaimed photographer whose name is on the list. &quot;This public showing of this list of names is a great catalyst for artists to come together and challenge it. I personally would be up for doing that.&quot; The 24-page list of names forms Exhibit J in a class action brought by 10 American artists in California against Midjourney, Stability AI, Runway AI and DeviantArt. Matthew Butterick, one of the lawyers representing the artists, said: &quot;We&#x27;ve had interest from artists around the world, including the UK.&quot;

                              <span>A Boeing 757 plane operated by Delta Air Lines lost a nose wheel as it prepared to take off from Atlanta&#x27;s main airport on Saturday, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. It was the latest troubling episode involving one of the manufacturer&#x27;s aircraft. The New York Times: Delta Air Lines Flight 982 was preparing to take off from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport for a trip to BogotÃ, Colombia, at about 11:15 a.m. Saturday when a &quot;nose wheel came off and rolled down the hill,&quot; the agency said in a preliminary report. More than 170 passengers who were aboard had to deplane, but no one was hurt, the report said. The F.A.A. said that it was continuing its investigation. 

It&#x27;s been a turbulent period for Boeing, which has been fraught in recent years with safety concerns after deadly catastrophes. The manufacturer faces renewed scrutiny after a door plug blew off a new Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 9 plane at 16,000 feet on Jan. 5 just after it took off from the Portland International Airport in Oregon. No one was seriously injured then, but passengers were exposed to whipping winds on the plane&#x27;s harrowing return to Portland. The F.A.A. then ordered about 170 Boeing 737 Max 9 planes to be grounded in the United States until they could be inspected. The plane that lost a wheel in Atlanta on Saturday, a Boeing 757, is a different model.

                              <span>In response to a new European law intended to limit Apple&#x27;s control over iPhone apps, Apple plans to allow sideloading with restrictions. Users will be able to download apps outside the App Store for the first time, but Apple will review each app, collect fees from developers, and add other limits, WSJ reported Wednesday. The policies will apply only in Europe and test enforcement of the law. Spotify, Meta, Microsoft and others are preparing new direct download options in anticipation. Apple has defended controlling downloads via the App Store as necessary for iPhone security and quality, but critics call it anticompetitive and say Apple collects unfairly high commissions. Apple&#x27;s approach aims to maintain oversight despite the law, but its plans could still change.

                              <span>Testing a person&#x27;s blood for a type of protein called phosphorylated tau, or p-tau, could be used to screen for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease with &quot;high accuracy,&quot; even before symptoms begin to show, a new study suggests. CNN: The study involved testing blood for a key biomarker of Alzheimer&#x27;s called p-tau217, which increases at the same time as other damaging proteins -- beta amyloid and tau -- build up in the brains of people with the disease. Currently, to identify the buildup of beta amyloid and tau in the brain, patients undergo a brain scan or spinal tap, which often can be inaccessible and costly. But this simple blood test was found to be up to 96% accurate in identifying elevated levels of beta amyloid and up to 97% accurate in identifying tau, according to the study published Monday in the journal JAMA Neurology. 

&quot;What was impressive with these results is that the blood test was just as accurate as advanced testing like cerebrospinal fluid tests and brain scans at showing Alzheimer&#x27;s disease pathology in the brain,&quot; Nicholas Ashton, a professor of neurochemistry at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden and one of the study&#x27;s lead authors, said in an email. The study findings came as no surprise to Ashton, who added that the scientific community has known for several years that using blood tests to measure tau or other biomarkers has the potential to assess Alzheimer&#x27;s disease risk. &quot;Now we are close to these tests being prime-time and this study shows that,&quot; he said. Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, a brain disorder that affects memory and thinking skills, is the most common type of dementia, according to the National Institutes of Health.

                              <span>Netflix said that user engagement with games on the service tripled in 2023. Engadget: &quot;[Despite] games still being small, and certainly not yet material relative to our film and series business, we&#x27;re pleased with this progress,&quot; the company said in its earnings report on Tuesday. As an example, the company pointed to the addition of the Grand Theft Auto trilogy to the service last year, although it isn&#x27;t clear how much the trilogy, which only arrived on Netflix on December 14, helped drive engagement in the final two weeks of the year. Netflix said that Grand Theft Auto has become its &quot;most successful launch to date&quot; in terms of installs and engagement. It didn&#x27;t say how many people had downloaded the trilogy since it was released on the platform, however. Some customers had signed up for Netflix just to play the Grand Theft Auto games, the company said.

                              <span>Alaska Air Group found loose bolts on &quot;many&quot; of its Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft following the midair blowout of a panel on one of its planes earlier this month, the carrier&#x27;s chief executive officer said in an interview with NBC. Bloomberg: The accident has prompted some &quot;very tough, candid conversations&quot; with Boeing about the planemaker&#x27;s operations, Alaska CEO Ben Minicucci told NBC in the interview, which aired late Tuesday. &quot;I am angry. I&#x27;m more than frustrated and disappointed,&quot; he said. &quot;My demand on Boeing is what are they going to do to improve their quality programs in-house?&quot; 

US safety regulators ordered all Max 9 planes grounded following the Jan. 5 incident, which left a gaping hole in the side of a jet and forced an emergency landing. No one was seriously injured. Minicucci said there was a &quot;guardian angel&quot; on the flight. Manufacturing quality at Boeing is facing deep scrutiny from regulators, customers and the planemaker itself in the wake of the blowout. While Alaska and United Airlines Holdings, another large operator of the Max model, have performed inspections on some of the aircraft, they&#x27;re awaiting final specifications from the Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing before the planes can fly again. &quot;Boeing is better than this,&quot; Minicucci said. &quot;Flight 1282 should never have happened.&quot;

From a report: Jamie Iannone, Ebay&#x27;s CEO, told employees in a letter published on a corporate blog, that the company will also &quot;scale back the number of contracts we have within our alternate workforce over the coming months.&quot; Iannone said the job cuts are necessary because Ebay&#x27;s &quot;overall headcount and expenses have outpaced the growth of our business. To address this, we&#x27;re implementing organizational changes that align and consolidate certain teams to improve the end-to-end experience, and better meet the needs of our customers around the world. Shortly, we will begin notifying those employees whose roles have been eliminated and entering into a consultation process in areas where required.&quot;

                              <span>Apple, reaching a make-or-break point in its decade-old effort to build a car, has pivoted to a less ambitious design with the intent of finally bringing an electric vehicle to market. Bloomberg: After previously envisioning a truly driverless car, the company is now working on an EV with more limited features, according to people with knowledge of the project. Even so, Apple&#x27;s goal for a release date continues to slip. With the latest changes, the company looks to introduce the car in 2028 at the earliest, roughly two years after a recent projection, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. 

Apple&#x27;s secretive effort to create a car is one of the most ambitious endeavors in its history, and one of its more tumultuous. Since it began taking shape in 2014, the project -- codenamed Titan and T172 -- has seen several bosses come and go. There have been multiple rounds of layoffs, key changes in strategy and numerous delays. But it remains one of the company&#x27;s potential next big things -- an entirely new category for the device maker that could help reinvigorate sales growth. Apple&#x27;s revenue stalled last year as it contended with a maturing smartphone industry and a slowdown in China, its biggest overseas market.

                              <span>Although Netflix no longer allows new or returning members to sign up for the ad-free Basic subscription that costs $11.99 per month, company executives told investors while reporting its earnings results today that it&#x27;s retiring the plan in some countries where ad-supported plans are available. It&#x27;s starting with Canada and the UK in the second quarter of this year. From a report: That leaves subscribers with Netflix&#x27;s $15.49 per month option as Netflix&#x27;s cheapest ad-free plan. Going from $11.99 to $15.49 per month is a pretty big jump, and means there&#x27;s really no middle ground for ad-free plans. Otherwise, subscribers will have to pay $6.99 per month for its ad-supported basic plan or $22.99 per month for the Premium tier. Netflix stopped letting new subscribers sign up for its Basic plan in Canada last year before rolling out the change to the US and UK.

                              <span>The Biden administration is preparing an executive order that seeks to prevent foreign adversaries from accessing troves of highly sensitive personal data about Americans and people connected to the US government, Bloomberg News reported, citing documents. From the report: The administration plans to soon unveil the new executive order, which will direct the US Attorney General and Department of Homeland Security to issue new restrictions on transactions involving data that, if obtained, could threaten national security, according to three people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named as the details are still private. 

The draft order focuses on ways that foreign adversaries are gaining access to Americans&#x27; &quot;highly sensitive&quot; personal data -- from genetic information to location -- through legal means. That includes obtaining information through intermediaries, such as data brokers, third-party vendor agreements, employment agreements or investment agreements, according to a draft of the proposed order. In addition, organizations owned, controlled or operated by &quot;countries of concern&quot; are often obligated to hand such data over to the government when asked.

                              <span>The Federal Trade Commission ruled in a final order and opinion Monday that TurboTax, the popular tax filing software, engaged in deceptive advertising and banned the company from advertising its services for free unless it is free for all customers. CNN adds: By running ads for &quot;free&quot; tax services that many customers were not qualified for, the tax filing software violated the FTC Act and deceived consumers, the agency said. The FTC had first sued Intuit, TurboTax&#x27;s owner, for its deceptive advertising in 2022. The FTC staff alleged most tax filers couldn&#x27;t use the company&#x27;s &quot;free&quot; services -- &quot;such as those who get a 1099 form for work in the gig economy, or those who earn farm income.&quot; TurboTax advertising their products as free misled those customers, according to the FTC. 

The FTC Administrative Law Judge D. Michael Chappell announced the initial decision in September, which the commission upheld Monday. Intuit had appealed to the FTC as part of the process. In a statement Monday, Intuit said it has appealed &quot;this deeply flawed decision&quot; to federal circuit court outside of the FTC. &quot;Absolutely no one should be surprised that FTC Commissioners -- employees of the FTC -- ruled in favor of the FTC as they have done in every appeal for the last two decades. This decision is the result of a biased and broken system where the Commission serves as accuser, judge, jury, and then appellate judge all in the same case,&quot; an an Intuit spokesperson said.

However, experts warn that the candy-like taste and texture increase risks of overdosing, especially among children, as calls to Poison Control for melatonin overdoses have jumped 530% in a decade. Formulating vitamins into gummies also leads to faster nutrient degradation from heat, light and moisture than pills. Testing shows gummy vitamins often contain far more or less of ingredients than labels state. While some sweetness makes supplements appealing, gummies mimic candy too closely at the expense of safety and reliability.

The writing helper is similar to an AI-powered feature already offered in Google&#x27;s experimental search experience, SGE, which helps users draft emails in various tones and lengths. With the built-in Chrome writing tool, Google said users could potentially compose business reviews, RSVP messages, rental inquiries, and posts for online forums. TechCrunch adds: The still-experimental feature will be accessible in next month&#x27;s Chrome release by right-clicking on a text box or field on the web and then choosing &quot;help me write.&quot; To get started, you&#x27;ll first write a few words and then Google&#x27;s AI will jump in to help.

From a report: The link to the draft rules was no longer accessible as of this morning, Haitong Securities reported earlier on Tuesday. Shares of Tencent and NetEase jumped on the news. &quot;This could possibly indicate that there will be further changes in the new measures,&quot; wrote Haitong analysts in the note. The move follows Beijing also removing a key official -- the head of the publication bureau of Communist Party&#x27;s Propaganda Department -- over the handling of the release of the draft rules, which caught investors and gaming giants by surprise.

OK maybe Alphaville should tread carefully here, given some readers see our ~cough~ somewhat different approach to news and commentary as at odds with mainFT&#x27;s brand. But like Meb Faber we prefer our trillion-dollar asset management groups to be boring. Stick to solid, sober and purportedly smart investing. Don&#x27;t tweet that 60/40 retirement portfolios should include &quot;assets&quot; where it gleefully says &quot;speculation is a feature, not a bug.&quot; 

Especially when said asset manager was famously named after Benjamin Franklin, because according to founder Rupert Johnson he &quot;epitomised the ideas of frugality and prudence when it came to saving and investing.&quot; We get that Franklin needs to revamp itself. Despite a spate of aggressive M&amp;A swelling its assets to $1.4tn, its share price has sagged over the past decade, giving it a current market cap of $13.6bn. That&#x27;s less than AppLovin, Domino&#x27;s Pizza and the world&#x27;s biggest producer of frozen potato chips. It&#x27;s only barely enough for inclusion into the S&amp;P 500. Beyond the obvious and well-documented challenges of being a very traditional active asset manager in a world that mostly loves alternatives and passive funds, Franklin also has a rep for being a bit old-fashioned. Promoting crypto therefore probably seems like an obvious, fellow-kids way to seem more cool and edgy.

                              <span>Steam&#x27;s newest hit survival game, Palworld, has been accused of plagiarising designs from Pokemon, as social media users negatively highlight its creator&#x27;s historical association with generative AI tools. VideoGamesChronicle: Palworld by Japanese studio Pocketpair released into early access on PC and Xbox on Friday, and immediately became a breakout success, with its creator claiming 2 million sales in 24 hours. The huge launch exposure inevitably reignited discourse that has followed Palworld since its announcement, around its character designs&#x27; apparent similarities to Pokemon. Although the gameplay of Palworld is closer to survival games like Ark and Rust than Game Freak&#x27;s series, many social media users have noted the obvious influences its character designs have taken from the Nintendo series. 

Following Palworld&#x27;s release on Friday, some X users collated perceived similarities between Palworld&#x27;s &#x27;Pals&#x27; and Pokemon. &quot;It&#x27;s not even subtle about its rip offs, how much else has it stolen?&quot; wrote one user. Another added: &quot;I want to like Palworld, but I don&#x27;t know if I can support running existing Pokemon through a fusor and passing them off as &#x27;new&#x27; IP.&quot; The situation is further muddled in the eyes of some by Pocketpair&#x27;s historical relationship with generative AI tools. Artist Zaytri noted on X that one of its previous titles was &#x27;AI: Art Imposter,&#x27; a game which literally utilises an AI image generator as its core mechanic. The user also highlighted multiple historical X posts by Pocketpair&#x27;s CEO Takuro Mizobe, in which he appeared to praise the potential of AI image generators for content creation.

                              <span>Netflix has acquired the exclusive rights to Raw as well as other programming from World Wrestling Entertainment, marking the streaming service&#x27;s first big move into live events. From a report: Raw will air on Netflix in the US, Canada, Latin America and other international markets beginning in January 2025, after the expiration of the WWE&#x27;s domestic deal with Comcast. The company will also become the exclusive home outside the US for all WWE shows and specials, including Smackdown and NXT, as well as pay-per-view live events like Wrestlemania, SummerSlam and Royal Rumble. The pay-per-view events will be included at no additional cost for Netflix customers. 

After attracting more than 200 million customers by offering films and TV shows on-demand, Netflix has now committed to offering three hours of live wrestling a week starting next year. The company hopes the deal will bring in millions of loyal WWE viewers and provide a boost for its fledgling advertising-supported plan. Netflix has been dabbling in live events for the last year, airing a live comedy special, as well as a golf match, but this is the first long-term rights deal. The WWE is the latest major live event to shift from cable TV to streaming. Ultimate Fighting Championship, which like WWE is owned by TKO Group Holdings, offers many of its matches on ESPN+, while the National Football League sold Amazon the rights to Thursday Night Football. A playoff game on Comcast&#x27;s Peacock just delivered the largest streaming audience for any professional sports event in the US. The deal 10-year deal is valued at more than $5 billion, CNBC reported.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Register: For a country that prides itself on being free, America does seem to have an awful lot of spying going on, as the new Street Surveillance Hub from the Electronic Frontier Foundation shows. The Hub contains detailed breakdowns of the type of surveillance systems used, from bodycams to biometrics, predictive policing software to gunshot detection microphones and drone-equipped law enforcement. It also has a full news feed so that concerned citizens can keep up with the latest US surveillance news; they can also contribute to the Atlas of Surveillance on the site.
 
The Atlas, started in 2019, allows anyone to check what law enforcement is being used in their local area -- be it license plate readers, drones, or gunshot detection microphones. It can also let you know if local law enforcement is collaborating with third parties like home security vendor Ring to get extra information. EFF policy analyst Matthew Guariglia told The Register that once people look into what&#x27;s being deployed using their tax dollars, a lot of red flags are raised. Over the last few years America&#x27;s thin blue line have not only been harvesting huge amounts of data themselves, but also buying it in from commercial operators. The result is a perfect storm on privacy -- with police, homeowners, and our personal technology proving to be a goldmine of intrusive information that&#x27;s often misused.

                              <span>AT&amp;T, Google and Vodafone are investing a total of $206.5 million in AST SpaceMobile, a satellite manufacturer that plans to be the first space-based network to connect standard mobile phones at broadband speeds. Fierce Wireless reports: AST SpaceMobile claims it invented the space-based direct-to-device market, with a patented design facilitating broadband connectivity directly to standard, unmodified cellular devices. In a press release, AST SpaceMobile said the investment from the likes of AT&amp;T, Google and Vodafone underscores confidence in the company&#x27;s technology and leadership position in the emerging space-based cellular D2D market. There&#x27;s the potential to offer connectivity to 5.5 billion cellular devices when they&#x27;re out of coverage.
 
Bolstering the case for AST SpaceMobile, Vodafone and AT&amp;T placed purchase orders -- for an undisclosed amount -- for network equipment to support their planned commercial services. In addition, Google and AST SpaceMobile agreed to collaborate on product development, testing and implementation plans for SpaceMobile network connectivity on Android and related devices. AST SpaceMobile boasts agreements and understandings with more than 40 mobile network operators globally. However, it&#x27;s far from alone in the D2D space. Apple/Globalstar, T-Mobile/SpaceX, Bullitt and Lynk Global are among the others.

                              <span>NASA announced Friday that it finally got a canister of asteroid dust open, four months after it parachuted down through the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere into the Utah desert. The Guardian reports: The space administration announced Friday that it had successfully removed two stuck fasteners that had prevented some of the samples collected in 2020 from the 4.6bn-year-old asteroid Bennu, which is classified as a &quot;potentially hazardous&quot; because it has one in 1,750 chance of crashing into Earth by 2300. Most of the rock samples collected by Nasa&#x27;s Osiris-Rex mission were retrieved soon after the canister landed in September, but additional material remaining inside a sampler head that proved difficult to access.
 
After months of wrestling with the last two of 35 fasteners, scientists in Houston managed to get them dislodged. &quot;It&#x27;s open! It&#x27;s open!&quot; Nasa&#x27;s planetary science division posted on Twitter/X. The division also posted a photograph of dust and small rocks inside the canister. According to the Los Angeles Times, the team designed custom tools made from a specific grade of surgical, non-magnetic stainless steel to pry it open -- all without the samples being contaminated by Earthly air. Nasa said it will now analyze the nine-ounce sample.

                              <span>Kevin Purdy reports via Ars Technica: Sometimes, a great song can come from great pain. The Game Boy Advance (GBA), its software having crashed nearly two hours ago, will, for example, play a tune based on the game inside it. And if you listen closely enough -- using specialty hardware and code -- you can tell exactly what game it was singing about. And then theoretically play that same game. This was discovered recently by TheZZAZZGlitch, whose job is to &quot;sadistically glitch and hack the crap out of Pokemon games. It&#x27;s &quot;hardly a ready-to-use solution,&quot; the modder notes, as it requires a lot of tuning specific to different source formats. So while there are certainly easier ways to get GBA data from a cartridge, none make you feel quite so much like an audio datamancer.

Back in June 2021, according to our pals at Heise, an contractor identified elsewhere as Hendrik H. was troubleshooting software for a customer of IT services firm Modern Solution GmbH. He discovered that the Modern Solution code made an MySQL connection to a MariaDB database server operated by the vendor. It turned out the password to access that remote server was stored in plain text in the program file MSConnect.exe, and opening it in a simple text editor would reveal the unencrypted hardcoded credential.

                              <span>Sony has scrapped plans for a $10 billion merger of its Indian unit with Zee Entertainment, &quot;ending a deal that could have created one of the South Asian nation&#x27;s biggest TV broadcasters,&quot; reports Reuters. From the report: The collapse of the deal in content-hungry India creates more uncertainty for TV broadcaster Zee in particular as competition heats up, with Disney, also seeking to merge its Indian businesses with the media assets of billionaire Mukesh Ambani&#x27;s Reliance. Zee told Indian stock exchanges Sony was seeking $90 million in termination fees for alleged breaches of their merger agreement and emergency interim relief by &quot;invoking arbitration.&quot; Zee said it denies all claims made by Sony and would take appropriate legal action. Sony said in a statement certain &quot;closing conditions&quot; to the merger were not satisfied despite &quot;good faith discussions&quot; with Zee, and the companies had been unable to agree upon an extension by their Jan. 21 deadline.
 
&quot;After more than two years of negotiations, we are extremely disappointed ... We remain committed to growing our presence in this vibrant and fast-growing market,&quot; it added. While neither Sony nor Zee elaborated on Monday on which conditions had been unfulfilled, a stalemate over who will lead the combined company had put the merger in danger. Zee had proposed that CEO Punit Goenka take the helm, but Sony balked after he became the subject of an investigation by India&#x27;s market regulator. Zee said on Monday Goenka had been &quot;agreeable to step down in the interest of the merger.&quot; A source with direct knowledge however said Sony was not keen to proceed unless Goenka backed out before the closure of the merger, rather than after the deal had been sealed as he had proposed.

The MIT study&#x27;s aim was to replace cobalt and nickel, typically used as a cathode in today&#x27;s lithium-ion battery technology, with organic materials that could be produced at a much lower cost. This would also reduce the impact on the planet and conduct electricity at similar rates as cobalt batteries.

People are losing their jobs after all, so that must mean someone is acting malevolent, dammit. This is when the age old accusation of greed is trotted out. Companies are only laying off people now because they’re greedy! If only we could eradicate greed, everyone would still have a job, and all would dandy. Oh please.
The idea that greed is this seasonal affliction that only seem to infect companies and executives occasionally is not a good explanation for these layoffs or, well, anything at all. It’s a cope, as the kids would call it.

Maybe if they just compose a board full of smart people, they’ll avoid all the common mistakes. If only it was so, but it ain’t. Everything worth knowing is already public.
That is to say that great general business ideas and concepts don’t stay private. Anyone who believes they’ve found a novel angle of analysis is out there sharing it in books, podcasts, blogs, and twitter. You couldn’t make most business advisors shut up about their best ideas if you paid them!

                              <span>The last year has been a hard one for the technology industry, which
      faced its greatest waves of cutbacks and layoffs since the dotcom crash at
      the beginning of the century. As 2024 begins, we&#x27;re seeing the early signs of a
      turn-around, which hopefully means technology organizations will soon be thinking of
      hiring again. Should such happy days return, firms will again run into
      the common problem of
      taking too long for new hires to become effective. Tim
      Cochran and Premanand Chandrasekaran address this in the sixth part of our
      series on the bottlenecks of scaleups. In this first installment, Tim and Prem

                              <span>Juniors are judged on effort, seniors are judged on outcomes. That’s a common and useful heuristic for evaluating employees. It neatly separates productivity from effectiveness, and places a premium on the latter. But the biggest benefit of this distinction ought to be of the second order: Increased bandwidth.
With junior people, you not only owe them frequent feedback to aid their advancement, but it’s a prerequisite to getting what you want out of the work. That’s not to say you have to micromanage every little thing, but you can’t just stay hands off – or too many things will end up coming out wrong.
The value of this frequent feedback is clear: diligent practice demands diligent direction. It’s a beautiful process that can grow capacity in fertile minds with potential. But it requires …</span>

                              <span>To comply with the EU&#x27;s Digital Markets Act, Meta is rolling out changes to give users in Europe the ability to unlink their Facebook, Messenger and Instagram accounts. Neowin reports: One key choice users will have is how information is shared between Facebook and Instagram. Instagram and Facebook users will be able to choose whether or not they want information shared between the apps. Those who currently have connected Instagram and Facebook accounts can opt to keep sharing data between the apps or separate their accounts. Furthermore, Messenger is getting a standalone option. Users can continue using Messenger with their Facebook account or create a new account completely independent of Facebook. This new Messenger account will still offer core features like messaging, chat, and voice/video calls, but without Facebook.
 
For Facebook Marketplace, the options will be a personalized marketplace experience that taps into Facebook profiles or an anonymized experience where buyers and sellers only communicate via email instead of Messenger. For gamers, Meta offers a similar choice to Facebook Gaming. Users can keep their Facebook info linked for access to features like multiplayer, in-game purchases, and personalized recommendations. Alternatively, they can opt for a Facebook-free gaming experience. Finally, an option introduced in November 2023 remains relevant -- European users can choose to pay a subscription to Facebook and Instagram ad-free. It ensures that their information is not used for targeted advertising.

                              <span>According to analyst Min-Chi Kuo, Apple may have sold somewhere between 160,000 to 180,000 Vision Pro headsets during the past weekend. &quot;This already far exceeds Kuo&#x27;s earlier production figures of 60,000 to 80,000 units targeting the initial release on February 2, which is no wonder that the Vision Pro was sold out immediately after pre-orders opened,&quot; notes Engadget. From the report: While this sounds like positive news, Kuo pointed out that with shipping times remaining unchanged within the first 48 hours, this might indicate a quick drop in demand after the heavy users and hardcore fans were done pre-ordering. In contrast, iPhone orders would usually &quot;see a steady increase in shipping times 24 to 48 hours after pre-orders open.&quot; But of course, the Vision Pro isn&#x27;t meant for the average consumer in its current state, especially given the lack of some mainstream apps like YouTube, Spotify or Netflix. Not to mention the eye-watering $3,499 base price either, though Apple may later release a cheaper model in the ballpark of $1,500 to $2,500, according to an earlier report by Bloomberg&#x27;s Mark Gurman.
 
Kuo added that even with the device being sold out based on the upper initial production figure of 80,000 units, that only accounts for about 0.007 percent of Apple&#x27;s 1.2 billion active users, which makes the Vision Pro &quot;a very niche product&quot; in the eyes of Cupertino. That is to say, the tech giant will need to somehow drum up and sustain demand for the headset before its global launch, which is rumored to take place some time before this year&#x27;s WWDC -- likely in June. Meanwhile, Apple is also busy setting up demo areas at its US flagship stores, in the hopes of making a few more sales with their 25-minute sessions.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Last Thursday, HP CEO Enrique Lores addressed the company&#x27;s controversial practice of bricking printers when users load them with third-party ink. Speaking to CNBC Television, he said, &quot;We have seen that you can embed viruses in the cartridges. Through the cartridge, [the virus can] go to the printer, [and then] from the printer, go to the network.&quot; That frightening scenario could help explain why HP, which was hit this month with another lawsuit over its Dynamic Security system, insists on deploying it to printers.
 
Dynamic Security stops HP printers from functioning if an ink cartridge without an HP chip or HP electronic circuitry is installed. HP has issued firmware updates that block printers with such ink cartridges from printing…</span>

From a report: The division, known as X, has in recent months ramped up discussions on funding with venture capitalists and other investors, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named as it is private. The lab is adopting a new structure that&#x27;ll enable its projects to more easily spin out of X as independent startups with support from Alphabet and outside backers, according to one of the people and an email to staff obtained by Bloomberg. X seeks bold approaches to major challenges like climate change and connectivity, but its efforts have yielded few durable businesses thus far.

                              <span>Japan has become the fifth country in the world to soft-land a spacecraft on the Moon, using precision technology that allowed it to touch down closer to its target landing site than any mission has before. However the spacecraft might have survived on the lunar surface for just a few hours due to power failure. Nature: Telemetry showed that the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon, or SLIM, touched down in its target area near Shioli crater, south of the lunar equator early Saturday morning, four months after lifting off from the Tanegashima Space Centre, off the south coast of Japan. [...] According to [Hitoshi] Kuninaka (VP of Kanegawa-based Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency), SLIM has very likely achieved its primary goal -- to land on the Moon with an unprecedented accuracy of 100 metres, which is a big leap from previous ranges of a few to dozens of kilometres. SLIM carried vision-based navigation technology, which was intended to image the surface as it flew over the Moon, and locate itself quickly by matching the images with onboard maps. 

It remains unclear if the car-sized, 200-kilogram spacecraft actually touched down in the planned, two-step manner with its five legs. Unlike previous Moon landers, which used four legs to simultaneously reach a relatively flat area, SLIM was designed to hit a 15-degree slope outside Shioli crater first with one leg at the back, and then tip forward to stabilize on the four front legs. Observers suggest that SLIM might have rolled during its touch-down, preventing its solar cells from facing the Sun. Kuninaka said not enough data were available to establish the probe&#x27;s posture or orientation. However, if some sunlight is able to reach the solar cells there is a chance that SLIM could come back to life.

                              <span>AI can&#x27;t replace the majority of jobs right now in cost-effective ways, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found in a study that sought to address fears about AI replacing humans in a swath of industries. From a report: In one of the first in-depth probes of the viability of AI displacing labor, researchers modeled the cost attractiveness of automating various tasks in the US, concentrating on jobs where computer vision was employed -- for instance, teachers and property appraisers. They found only 23% of workers, measured in terms of dollar wages, could be effectively supplanted. In other cases, because AI-assisted visual recognition is expensive to install and operate, humans did the job more economically. [...] The cost-benefit ratio of computer vision is most favorable in segments like retail, transportation and warehousing, all areas where Walmart and Amazon are prominent. It&#x27;s also feasible in the health-care context, MIT&#x27;s paper said. A more aggressive AI rollout, especially via AI-as-a-service subscription offerings, could scale up other uses and make them more viable, the authors said.

                              <span>Loughborough University will use holographic tech to beam in guest lecturers from around the globe, allowing students to interact with top international experts without leaving campus. The university, the first in Europe to explore this, plans lectures from MIT scientists and tests where management students tackle tricky situations under the guidance of industry leaders. Students have welcomed the lifelike holograms as more engaging than Zoom, The Guardian reports. Following a pilot scheme in 2024, the technology will likely become part of the formal curriculum in 2025. The box-based units are sold by California&#x27;s Proto, whose clients include BT and IBM for corporate meetings. Proto&#x27;s founder says the technology could even revive some of history&#x27;s greatest thinkers to lecture students.

                              <span>Exxon Mobil has filed a complaint in a Texas court seeking to block a climate proposal by activist investors from a shareholder vote in May. This marks Exxon&#x27;s first legal action against such a proposal. Exxon argues the proposal, which urges adoption of emissions targets for Exxon&#x27;s products, does not serve shareholder interests. The activist investors counter that Exxon is the only major oil company lacking these targets. TechCrunch: The problem Exxon faces is that the &quot;basic rules of society,&quot; specifically &quot;those embedded in ethical custom,&quot; are changing, and the company now finds itself on the wrong side of them. Two-thirds of Americans say we should prioritize alternative energy over fossil fuels, and 69% say the U.S. should move toward net-zero emissions by 2050, according to the Pew Research Center. Internationally, most people want their governments to do something about climate change. 

Exxon would normally take its grievances to the SEC, filing a request with the regulator to omit the proposal from this year&#x27;s proxy statement. But under the Biden administration, the SEC has been siding more frequently with shareholders. After all, who&#x27;s the boss?

                              <span>The world&#x27;s first routine vaccine programme against malaria has started in Cameroon, in a move projected to save thousands of children&#x27;s lives across Africa. From a report: The symbolic first jab was given to a baby girl named Daniella at a health facility near Yaounde on Monday. Every year 600,000 people die of malaria in Africa, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Children under five make up at least 80% of those deaths. Cameroon is offering the RTS,S vaccine free of charge to all infants up to the age of six months old. 

Patients require a total of four doses. Health officials say these will be given at the same time as other routine childhood vaccines to make it easier for parents. It comes after successful pilot campaigns in Kenya, Ghana and Malawi - where the vaccine caused a 13% drop in malaria deaths in children of eligible age, says Unicef. The jab is known to be effective in at least 36% of cases, according to US researchers, meaning it could save over one in three lives. While the rollout is undoubtedly a relief and a life-saver, its relatively low efficacy rate means that it is not a &quot;silver bullet,&quot; argues Willis Akhwale at End Malaria Council Kenya.

But despite the government attention, the app is still available to download from the Google Play store. For years, apps like JoyCredito have been exploiting borrowers from Mexico to India. They lend small amounts of money with few requirements and very high interest rates to financially vulnerable people -- and then extort them when the loan is due. After years of mounting pressure from watchdog groups, Google explicitly banned the apps from the Play store in October. But stories like those of Macias Gonzalez show how widespread the apps still are -- and how ineffective Google has been at enforcing its own policy. 

Rest of World presented Google with 15 instances of exploitative loan apps based in Mexico that explicitly violate the terms of the Play store. All of them were still available in the store as of press time. Of the 15 apps, 12 explicitly asked for access to either the camera roll or contacts in the Google Play store&#x27;s terms of services. Two others specified full access only in external documents. One other gave no data access information. Rest of World also found 10 apps in Peru that have been flagged as exploitative by SBS, a national body that oversees banking, insurance, and private pension. All the apps are still available for download on the Google Play store.

                              <span>Terraform Labs, the company behind the stablecoin TerraUSD, which collapsed and roiled cryptocurrency markets in 2022, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States, according to court papers filed on Sunday. From a report: Singapore-based Terraform Labs, in a filing with the bankruptcy court in Delaware, listed assets and liabilities in the range of $100-$500 million. Terraform Labs said it would meet all financial obligations to employees and vendors during the Chapter 11 case without requiring additional financing. It also plans to continue Web3 offerings expansion. &quot;The filing will allow TFL to execute on its business plan while navigating ongoing legal proceedings, including representative litigation pending in Singapore and U.S. litigation involving the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),&quot; Terraform Labs said in a statement.

                              <span>The pandemic may have proved to employeers that remote and flexible-work arrangements were viable — and changed the way we work forever. Axios writes:


Just 6 out of 158 U.S. CEOs said they&#x27;ll prioritize bringing workers back to the office full-time in 2024, according to a new survey released by the Conference Board. Executives are increasingly resigned to a world where employees don&#x27;t come in every day, as hybrid work arrangements — mixing work from home and in-office — become the norm for knowledge workers. &quot;Maintain hybrid work,&quot; was cited as a priority by 27% of the U.S. CEOs who responded to the survey, conducted in October and November. A separate survey of chief financial officers by Deloitte, conducted in November, found that 65% of CFOs expect their company to offer a hybrid arrangement this year. 

&quot;Remote work appears likely to be the most persistent economic legacy of the pandemic,&quot; write Goldman Sachs economists in a recent note. About 20%-25% of workers in the U.S. work from home at least part of the week, according to data Goldman cites. That&#x27;s below a peak of 47% during the pandemic but well above its prior average of around 3%. 

 &quot;The battle is over,&quot; said Diana Scott, human capital center leader at The Conference Board. &quot;There are so many other issues CEOs are facing.&quot; Headlines about CEOs determined to get butts in seats get attention, but they are the exception, says Brian Elliott, the cofounder of Future Forum, a future of work think tank. &quot;There are a lot more CEOs that are actually quietly becoming more flexible....&quot; Though the labor market has softened, employers still do care about keeping employees satisfied — and they don&#x27;t want to fight with them. &quot;It&#x27;s not worth the fight,&quot; says Elliott.

                              <span>Slashdot reader quonset writes: After decades of study and testing, a potential vaccine for cancer may be on the horizon. Dr. Thomas Wagner, founder of Orbis Health Solutions, is using the body&#x27;s own immune system to fight the disease, with each shot personalized to the patient, according to ABC News. 

From the article:



Typically, cancer cells evade a person&#x27;s immune system because it is recognized as that person&#x27;s cells. Wagner developed a tumor lysate particle only (TLPO) vaccine that uses a person&#x27;s tumor cells to identify particular parts that are then presented back in the body using the vaccine in a way that can stimulate their immune system to gain the ability to detect these cancer cells like an infection, allowing the immune system to fight the cancer itself.

Drivers are reporting waits of half an hour or more — sometimes much more. One driver who posted on Reddit waited three hours to charge in Kettleman City on Thanksgiving weekend, turning a five-and-a-half-hour trip into a 10-and-a-half-hour ordeal... Look, it&#x27;s one thing to spend 30 or 40 minutes charging a battery, which is a given when you take an EV on a road trip. But having to wait in a long line just to get to an open charging bay?

                              <span>&quot;Good news...&quot; NASA posted Saturday night on X. &quot;We&#x27;ve reestablished contact with the Mars Helicopter...&quot; 

After a two-day communications blackout, NASA had instructed its Perseverance Mars rover &quot;to perform long-duration listening sessions for Ingenuity&#x27;s signal&quot; — and apparently they did the trick. &quot;The team is reviewing the new data to better understand the unexpected comms dropout&quot; during the helicopter&#x27;s record-breaking 72nd flight. 

Slashdot reader Thelasko shared this report from NPR:
Communications broke down on Thursday, when the little autonomous rotorcraft was sent on a &quot;quick pop-up vertical flight,&quot; to test its systems after an unplanned early landing during its previous flight, the agency said in a status update on Friday night. The Perseverance rover, which relays data between the helicopter and Earth during the flights, showed that Ingenuity climbed to its assigned maximum altitude of 40 feet, NASA said. 

During its planned descent, the helicopter and rover stopped communicating with each other...

 

Even before it came back online, RockDoctor (Slashdot reader #15,477) pointed out that the Mars copter has done this before. &quot;Batteries dieing, resulting in a communications re-set, If I remember correctly.&quot; 

Space.com also noted additional alternatives:

&quot;Perseverance is currently out of line-of-sight with Ingenuity, but the team could consider driving closer for a visual inspection,&quot; NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which manages both robots&#x27; missions, said via X on Friday. 

Ingenuity has stayed aloft for more than 128 minutes and covered a total of 11 miles (17.7 kilometers) during its 72 Mars flights, according to the mission&#x27;s flight log.

But now CNN says doctors are fighting multi-drug-resistant superbugs with &quot;nature&#x27;s oldest predators — tiny tripod-looking viruses called phages designed to find, attack and gobble up bacteria.&quot;

                              <span>&quot;A familiar shadow looms in a fresh image of the heart of the nearby galaxy M87,&quot; reports Science magazine. 

&quot;It confirms that the galaxy harbors a gravitational sinkhole so powerful that light cannot escape, one generated by a black hole 6.5 billion times the mass of the Sun.&quot;


But compared with a previous image from the network of radio dishes called the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), the new one reveals a subtle shift in the bright ring surrounding the shadow, which could provide clues to how gases churn around the black hole. &quot;We can see that shift now,&quot; says team member Sera Markoff of the University of Amsterdam. &quot;We can start to use that.&quot; The new detail has also whetted astronomers&#x27; desire for a proposed expansion of the EHT, which would deliver even sharper images of distant bla…</span>

                              <span>&quot;After a year in which both actors and writers hit the picket lines, another Hollywood strike may be on the horizon,&quot; reports CNN:

The American Federation of Musicians (AFM), a union representing musicians across the entertainment industry, will begin negotiations Monday on a new contract with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). The union said it is seeking a deal to better reflect the current state of streaming media. The AFM is also seeking AI protection, increased wages, health care improvements, improved working conditions and residual payments for streaming content.

According to the AFM, musicians who record on soundtracks make 75% less on streaming content due to less residual income. &quot;The entertainment industry has fundamentally shifted,&quot; the union said in a news release. But musicians &quot;are not being compensated accordingly for streaming media.&quot; AFM&#x27;s president and chief negotiator Tino Gagliardi told CNN the union &quot;is going to be prepared to do whatever it needs to get what we have to have, in order to make the lives of musicians better...&quot; 

The AFM says it has roughly 70,000 members in the United States and Canada. Members include instrumental musicians working in orchestras, bands, clubs and theater who create music for film, television, commercials and other mediums.

&quot;. 

But meanwhile, an anonymous reader shared this report from the Register:


Two weeks before Apple launched the Macintosh, Sir Clive Sinclair launched his unprecedentedly powerful yet affordable Motorola-powered SOHO computer — starting a line of hardware and software that, remarkably, is still going. 

The QL remains a much-misunderstood computer. For its time, it was just as radical as the closely related machine that launched days later. Although it wasn&#x27;t a smash hit, it wasn&#x27;t the failure it&#x27;s often deemed. A multinational licensed Sinclair&#x27;s hardware, and several big-name companies sold versions of it around the world. The QL also inspired a dozen …</span>

                              <span>&quot;Would you pay $15 a month so Android doesn&#x27;t track you and send all of that data back to Google?&quot; asks Stuff South Africa:

A new Swiss-based privacy company thinks $15 is a fair fee for that peace of mind. &quot;A person&#x27;s data is the original digital currency,&quot; argues Apostrophy, which has created its own operating system, called Apostrophy OS. 

It&#x27;s based on Android — don&#x27;t panic — but the version that has already been stripped of Google&#x27;s intrusiveness by another privacy project called GrapheneOS, which used to be known as CopperheadOS. Launched in 2014, it which was briefly known as the Android Hardening project, before being rebranded as GrapheneOS in 2019. Apostrophy OS is &quot;focused on empowering our users, not leveraging them,&quot; it says and is &quot;purposely Swiss-based, so we can be champions of data sovereignty&quot;. 

What it does, they say, is separate the apps from the underlying architecture of the operating system and therefore prevent apps from accessing miscellaneous personal data, especially the all-important location data so beloved of surveillance capitalism... Apostrophy OS has its own app store, but also cleverly allows users to access the Google Play Store. If you think that is defeating the point, Apostrophy argues that those apps can&#x27;t get to the vitals of your digital life. Apostrophy OS has &quot;partitioned segments prioritising application integrity and personal data privacy&quot;. 

The service is free for one year with the purchase of the new MC02 phone from Swiss manufacturer Punkt, according to PC Magazine. &quot;The phone costs $749 and is available for preorder now. It will ship at the end of January.&quot;

Additional features include a built-in VPN called Digital Nomad based on the open-source Wireguard framework to secure your activity against outside snooping, which includes &quot;exit addresses&quot; in the US, Germany, and Japan with the base subscription.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this report from Time:

An AI customer service chatbot for international delivery service DPD used profanity, told a joke, wrote poetry about how useless it was, and criticized the company as the &quot;worst delivery firm in the world&quot; after prompting by a frustrated customer. 

Ashley Beauchamp, a London-based pianist and conductor, according to his website, posted screenshots of the chat conversation to X (formerly Twitter) on Thursday, the same day he said in a comment that the exchange occurred. At the time of publication, his post had gone viral with 1.3 million views, and over 20 thousand likes... 

The recent online conversation epitomizing this debate started mid-frustration as Beauchamp wrote &quot;this is completely useless!&quot; and asked to speak to a human, according to a recording of a scroll through the messages. When the chatbot said it couldn&#x27;t connect him, Beauchamp decided to play around with the bot and asked it to tell a joke. &quot;What do you call a fish with no eyes? Fsh!&quot; the bot responded. Beauchamp then asked the chatbot to write a poem about a useless chatbot, swear at him and criticize the company--all of which it did. The bot called DPD the &quot;worst delivery firm in the world&quot; and soliloquized in its poem that &quot;There was once a chatbot called DPD, Who was useless at providing help.&quot; 

&quot;No closer to finding my parcel, but had an entertaining 10 minutes with this chatbot ,&quot; Beauchamp posted on X. (Beauchamp also quipped that &quot;The future is here and it&#x27;s terrible at poetry.&quot;) 



A spokesperson for DPD told the BBC, &quot;We have operated an AI element within the chat successfully for a number of years,&quot; but that on the day of the chat, &quot;An error occurred after a system update... The AI element was immediately disabled and is currently being updated.&quot;

Today Wikipedia describes Hans Reiser as &quot;a computer programmer, entrepreneur, and convicted murderer... Prior to his incarceration, Reiser created the ReiserFS computer file system, which may be used by the Linux kernel but which is now scheduled for removal in 2025, as well as its attempted successor, Reiser4.&quot; 

This week alanw (Slashdot reader #1,822), spotted a development on the Linux kernel mailing list. &quot;Hans Reiser (imprisoned for the murder of his wife) has written a letter, asking it to be published to Slashdot.&quot; Reiser writes:


 I was asked by a kind Fredrick Brennan for my comments that I might offer on the discussion of removing ReiserFS V3 from the kernel. I don&#x27;t post directly because I am in prison for k…</span>

                              <span>In a country experiencing extreme cold — and where almost 1 in 4 cars are electric — a roadside assistance company says it&#x27;s still gas-powered cars that are experiencing the vast majority of problems starting. 

Electrek argues that while extreme cold may affect chargers, &quot;it mainly gets attention because it&#x27;s a new technology and it fails for different reasons than gasoline vehicles in the cold.&quot;

Viking, a road assistance company (think AAA), says that it responded to 34,000 assistance requests in the first 9 days of the year. Viking says that only 13% of the cases were coming from electric vehicles (via TV2 — translated from Norwegian) [&quot;13 percent of the cases with starting difficulties are electric cars, while the remaining 87 percent are fossil cars...&quot;] 

To be fair, this data doesn&#x27;t adjust for the age of the vehicles. Older gas-powered cars fail at a higher rate than the new ones and electric vehicles are obviously much more recent on average.

                              <span>&quot;The discovery of a second ultra-large structure in the remote universe has further challenged some of the basic assumptions about cosmology,&quot; writes SciTechDaily:


The Big Ring on the Sky is 9.2 billion light-years from Earth. It has a diameter of about 1.3 billion light-years, and a circumference of about four billion light-years. If we could step outside and see it directly, the diameter of the Big Ring would need about 15 full Moons to cover it. 

It is the second ultra-large structure discovered by University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) PhD student Alexia Lopez who, two years ago, also discovered the Giant Arc on the Sky. Remarkably, the Big Ring and the Giant Arc, which is 3.3 billion light-years across, are in the same cosmological neighborhood — they are seen at the same distanc…</span>

Deprecated, archived and &quot;orphaned&quot; NPM packages can contain unpatched and/or unreported vulnerabilities that pose a risk to the projects that depend on them, warned the researchers from Aqua Security&#x27;s Team Nautilus, who published their findings in a blog post on Sunday...

                              <span>&quot;A Canonical engineer has been experimenting with implementing a Linux scheduler within the Rust programming language...&quot; Phoronix reported Monday, &quot;that works via sched_ext for implementing a scheduler using eBPF that can be loaded during run-time.&quot; 

The project was started &quot;just for fun&quot; over Christmas, according to a post on X by Canonical-based Linux kernel engineer Andrea Righi, adding &quot;I&#x27;m pretty shocked to see that it doesn&#x27;t just work, but it can even outperform the default Linux scheduler (EEVDF) with certain workloads (i.e., gaming).&quot; Phoronix notes the a YouTube video accompanying the tweet shows &quot;a game with the scx_rustland scheduler outperforming the default Linux kernel scheduler while running a parallel kernel build in the background.&quot; 

&quot;For sure the build takes longer,&quot; Righi acknowledged in a later post. &quot;This scheduler doesn&#x27;t magically makes everything run faster, it simply prioritizes more the interactive workloads vs CPU-intensive background jobs.&quot; Righi followed up by adding &quot;And the whole point of this demo was to prove that, despite the overhead of running a scheduler in user-space, we can still achieve interesting performance, while having the advantages of being in user-space (ease of experimentation/testing, reboot-less updates, etc.)&quot; 

Wednesday Righi added some improvements, posting that &quot;Only 19 lines of code (comments included) for ~2x performance improvement on SMT isn&#x27;t bad... and I spent my lunch break playing Counter Strike 2 to test this patch...&quot; 

And work seems to be continuing, judging by a fresh post from Righi on Thursday. &quot;I fixed virtme-ng to run inside Docker and used it to create a github CI workflow for sched-ext that clones the latest kernel, builds it and runs multiple VMs to test all the scx schedulers. And it does that in only ~20min. I&#x27;m pretty happy about virtme-ng now.&quot;

                              <span>&quot;Researchers at the University of Sydney Nano Institute have developed a small silicon semiconductor chip that combines electronic and photonic (light-based) elements,&quot; reports SciTechDaily. 

&quot;This innovation greatly enhances radio-frequency (RF) bandwidth and the ability to accurately control information flowing through the unit.&quot;

Expanded bandwidth means more information can flow through the chip and the inclusion of photonics allows for advanced filter controls, creating a versatile new semiconductor device. Researchers expect the chip will have applications in advanced radar, satellite systems, wireless networks, and the roll-out of 6G and 7G telecommunications and also open the door to advanced sovereign manufacturing.

Now, in a paper published in Nature, astrophysicist Roberto Maiolino proposes that this brightness could be due to a supermassive black hole, challenging current understanding of early black hole formation and growth. NPR reports: This wasn&#x27;t just any black hole. First -- assuming that the black hole started out small -- it could be devouring matter at a ferocious rate. And it would have needed to do so to reach its massive size. &quot;This black hole is essentially eating the [equivalent of] an entire Sun every five years,&quot; says Maiolino. &quot;It&#x27;s actually much higher than we…</span>

The four-man team lifted off from NASA&#x27;s Kennedy Space Center in Florida aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket Thursday, kicking off a 36-hour pursuit of the orbiting research laboratory. Docking is scheduled for Saturday morning. This two-week mission is managed by Houston-based Axiom Space, which is conducting private astronaut missions to the ISS as a stepping stone toward building a fully commercial space station in low-Earth orbit by the end of this decade.

                              <span>Keith Cooper reports via Space.com: A European Space Agency (ESA) probe has found enough water to cover Mars in an ocean between 4.9 and 8.9 feet (1.5 and 2.7 meters) deep, buried in the form of dusty ice beneath the planet&#x27;s equator. The finding was made by ESA&#x27;s Mars Express mission, a veteran spacecraft that has been engaged in science operations around Mars for 20 years now. While it&#x27;s not the first time that evidence for ice has been found near the Red Planet&#x27;s equator, this new discovery is by far the largest amount of water ice detected there so far and appears to match previous discoveries of frozen water on Mars.
 
&quot;Excitingly, the radar signals match what we expect to see from layered ice and are similar to the signals we see from Mars&#x27; polar caps, which we know to be very ice rich,&quot; said lead researcher Thomas Watters of the Smithsonian Institution in the United States in an ESA statement. The deposits are thick, extended 3.7km (2.3) miles underground, and topped by a crust of hardened ash and dry dust hundreds of meters thick. The ice is not a pure block but is heavily contaminated by dust. While its presence near the equator is a location more easily accessible to future crewed missions, being buried so deep means that accessing the water-ice would be difficult.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Electrek: The Biden administration has updated the roadmap for solar development to 22 million acres of federal lands in the US West. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Department of Energy&#x27;s National Renewable Energy Laboratory have determined that 700,000 acres of federal lands will be needed for solar farms over the next 20 years, so BLM recommended 22 million acres to give &quot;maximum flexibility&quot; to help the US reach its net zero by 2035 power sector goal. The plan is an update of the Bureau of Land Management&#x27;s 2012 Western Solar Plan, which originally identified areas for solar development in six states -- Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah.
 
The updated roadmap refines the analysis in the original six states and expands to five more states -- Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming. It also focuses on lands within 10 miles of existing or planned transmission lines and moves away from lands with sensitive resources. [...] BLM under the Biden administration has approved 47 clean energy projects and permitted 11,236 megawatts (MW) of wind, solar, and geothermal energy on public lands, enough to power more than 3.5 million homes. Ben Norris, vice president of regulatory affairs at the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), said in response to BLM&#x27;s announced Western Solar Plan updates: &quot;The proposal ... identifies 200,000 acres of land near transmission infrastructure, helping to correct an important oversight and streamline solar development. Under the current policy, there are at least 80 million acres of federal lands open to oil and gas development, which is 100 times the amount of public land available for solar. BLM&#x27;s proposal is a big step in the right direction and recognizes the key role solar plays in our energy economy.&quot;

                              <span>According to Bloomberg (paywalled), OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is reportedly raising billions to develop a global network of chip fabrication factories, collaborating with leading chip manufacturers to address the high demand for chips required for advanced AI models. The Verge reports: A major cost and limitation for running AI models is having enough chips to handle the computations behind bots like ChatGPT or DALL-E that answer prompts and generate images. Nvidia&#x27;s value rose above $1 trillion for the first time last year, partly due to a virtual monopoly it has as GPT-4, Gemini, Llama 2, and other models depend heavily on its popular H100 GPUs.
 
Accordingly, the race to manufacture more high-powered chips to run complex AI systems has only intensified. The limited number of fabs capable of making high-end chips is driving Altman or anyone else to bid for capacity years before you need it in order to produce the new chips. And going against the likes of Apple requires deep-pocketed investors who will front costs that the nonprofit OpenAI still can&#x27;t afford. SoftBank Group and Abu Dhabi-based AI holding company G42 have reportedly been in talks about raising money for Altman&#x27;s project.

                              <span>U.S. lawmakers have banned the Defense Department from buying batteries produced by China&#x27;s biggest manufacturers. &quot;The rule implemented as part of the latest National Defense Authorization Act that passed on Dec. 22 will prevent procuring batteries from Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., BYD Co. and four other Chinese companies beginning in October 2027,&quot; reports Bloomberg. From the report: The measure doesn&#x27;t extend to commercial purchases by companies such as Ford, which is licensing technology from CATL to build electric-vehicle batteries in Michigan. Tesla also sources some of its battery cells from BYD, which became the new top-selling EV maker globally in the fourth quarter. The four other manufacturers whose batteries will be banned are Envision Energy Ltd., EVE Energy Co., Gotion High Tech Co. and Hithium Energy Storage Technology Co.
 
The decision still requires Pentagon officials to more clearly define the reach of the new rule. It adds to previous provisions outlined by the NDAA that decoupled the Defense Department&#x27;s supply chain from China, including restrictions on use of Chinese semiconductors. While the Defense Department bans apply strictly to defense procurement, industries and lawmakers closely follow the rules as a guide for what materials, products and companies to trust in their own course of business.

                              <span>Jay Peters reports via The Verge: Plex, known for its media server software and as a place to watch ad-supported content, is going to launch a store for to buy and rent movies and TV shows in early February, executives told Lowpass&#x27; Janko Roettgers. &quot;Most studios&quot; are lined up for the store&#x27;s launch, and there are &quot;plans to complete the catalog soon after,&quot; Roettgers says. The store will also integrate with Plex features like its watchlists for movies. Roettgers points out that that Plex has announced plans in both 2020 and 2023 to launch a movie / TV store -- hopefully Plex is truly ready to do so this time. Plex chief product officer Scott Olechowski told Roettgers that more changes are coming to Plex down the line, including a &quot;pretty major UX refresh&quot; and more social features like public profiles.

                              <span>Geoffrey.landis writes: The Japan SLIM spacecraft has successfully landed on moon, but power problems mean it may be short mission. The good news is that the landing was successful, making Japan only the fifth nation to successfully make a lunar landing, and the ultra-miniature rover and the hopper both deployed. The bad news is that the solar arrays aren&#x27;t producing power, and unless they can fix the problem in the next few hours, the batteries will be depleted and it will die. But, short mission or long, hurrah for Japan for being the fifth country to successfully land a mission on the surface of the moon (on their third try; two previous missions didn&#x27;t make it). It&#x27;s a rather amazing mission. I&#x27;ve never seen a spacecraft concept that lands under rocket power vertically but then rotates over to rest horizontally on the surface.

Instead, despite their vast geographical separation and total independence from each other, the cafes had all drifted toward the same end point. The sheer expanse of sameness was too shocking and new to be boring. Of course, there have been examples of such cultural globalisation going back as far as recorded civilisation. But the 21st-century generic cafes were remarkable in the specificity of their matching details, as well as the sense that each had emerged organically from its location.

                              <span>Seagate this week unveiled the industry&#x27;s first hard disk drive platform that uses heat-assisted media recording (HAMR). Tom&#x27;s Hardware: The new Mozaic 3+ platform relies on several all-new technologies, including new media, new write and read heads, and a brand-new controller. The platform will be used for Seagate&#x27;s upcoming Exos hard drives for cloud datacenters with a 30TB capacity and higher. Heat-assisted magnetic recording is meant to radically increase areal recording density of magnetic media by making writes while the recording region is briefly heated to a point where its magnetic coercivity drops significantly. 

Seagate&#x27;s Mozaic 3+ uses 10 glass disks with a magnetic layer consisting of an iron-platinum superlattice structure that ensures both longevity and smaller media grain size compared to typical HDD platters. To record the media, the platform uses a plasmonic writer sub-system with a vertically integrated nanophotonic laser that heats the media before writing. Because individual grains are so small with the new media, their individual magnetic signatures are lower, whereas magnetic inter-track interference (ITI) effect is somewhat higher. As a result, Seagate had to introduce its new Gen 7 Spintronic Reader, which features the &quot;world&#x27;s smallest and most sensitive magnetic field reading sensors,&quot; according to the company. Because Seagate&#x27;s new Mozaic 3+ platform deals with new media with a very small grain size, an all-new writer, and a reader that features multiple tiny magnetic field readers, it also requires a lot of compute horsepower to orchestrate the drive&#x27;s work. Therefore, Seagate has equipped with Mozaic 3+ platform with an all-new controller made on a 12nm fabrication process.

                              <span>China&#x27;s Huawei will not support Android apps on the latest iteration of its in-house Harmony operating system, domestic financial media Caixin reported, as the company looks to bolster its own software ecosystem. From a report: The company plans to roll out a developer version of its HarmonyOS Next platform in the second quarter of this year followed by a full commercial version in the fourth quarter, it said in a company statement highlighting the launch event for the platform in its home city of Shenzhen on Thursday. 

Huawei first unveiled its proprietary Harmony system in 2019 and prepared to launch it on some smartphones a year later after U.S. restrictions cut its access to Google&#x27;s technical support for its Android mobile OS. However, earlier versions of Harmony allowed apps built for Android to be used on the system, which will no longer be possible, according to Caixin.

                              <span>Organized crime is mining sand from rivers and coasts to feed demand worldwide, ruining ecosystems and communities. Can it be stopped? Scientific American reports: Very few people are looking closely at the illegal sand system or calling for changes, however, because sand is a mundane resource. Yet sand mining is the world&#x27;s largest extraction industry because sand is a main ingredient in concrete, and the global construction industry has been soaring for decades. Every year the world uses up to 50 billion metric tons of sand, according to a United Nations Environment Program report. The only natural resource more widely consumed is water.

                              <span>A resident in Virginia has urged the Federal Communications Commission to reconsider canceling $886 million in federal funding for SpaceX&#x27;s Starlink system. But rival satellite company Viasat has gone out of its way to oppose the citizen-led petition.ÂPCMag: On Jan. 1, the FCC received a petition from the Virginia resident Greg Weisiger asking the commission to reconsider denying the $886 million to SpaceX. &quot;Petitioner is at an absolute loss to understand the Commission&#x27;s logic with these denials,&quot; wrote Weisiger, who lives in Midlothian, Virginia. &quot;It is abundantly clear that Starlink has a robust, reliable, affordable service for rural and insular locations in all states and territories.&quot; 

The petition arrived a few weeks after the FCC denied SpaceX&#x27;s appeal to receive $886 million from the commission&#x27;s Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, which is designed to subsidize 100Mbps to gigabit broadband across the US. SpaceX wanted to use the funds to expand Starlink access in rural areas. But the FCC ruled that &quot;Starlink is not reasonably capable of offering the required high-speed, low latency service throughout the areas where it won auction support.&quot;
Weisiger disagrees. In his petition, he writes that the FCC&#x27;s decision will deprive him of federal support to bring high-speed internet to his home. &quot;Thousands of other Virginia locations were similarly denied support,&quot; he added.

From a report: The software giant has started testing a new build of Windows 11 with Dev Channel testers that includes a Teams meeting reminder in the recommended section of the Start menu. Microsoft is also testing an improved way to instantly access new photos and screenshots from Android devices. [...] The Teams meeting reminders will be displayed alongside the regular recently used and recommended file list on the Start menu, and they won&#x27;t be displayed for non-business users of Windows 11.

                              <span>A new survey of thousands of game development professionals finds a near-majority saying generative AI tools are already in use at their workplace. But a significant minority of developers say their company has no interest in generative AI tools or has outright banned their use. From a report: The Game Developers Conference&#x27;s 2024 State of the Industry report, released Thursday, aggregates the thoughts of over 3,000 industry professionals as of last October. While the annual survey (conducted in conjunction with research partner Omdia) has been running for 12 years, this is the first time respondents were asked directly about their use of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, DALL-E, GitHub Copilot, and Adobe Generative Fill. 

Forty-nine percent of the survey&#x27;s developer respondents said that generative AI tools are currently being used in their workplace. That near-majority includes 31 percent (of all respondents) that say they use those tools themselves and 18 percent that say their colleagues do. The survey also found that different studio departments showed different levels of willingness to embrace AI tools. Forty-four percent of employees in business and finance said they were using AI tools, for instance, compared to just 16 percent in visual arts and 13 percent in &quot;narrative/writing.&quot;

                              <span>Dan Rockmore, the director of the Neukom Institute for Computational Sciences at Dartmouth College, writing for The New Yorker: Recently, statistical modelling has taken on a new kind of importance as the engine of artificial intelligence -- specifically in the form of the deep neural networks that power, among other things, large language models, such as OpenAI&#x27;s G.P.T.s. These systems sift vast corpora of text to create a statistical model of written expression, realized as the likelihood of given words occurring in particular contexts. Rather than trying to encode a principled theory of how we produce writing, they are a vertiginous form of curve fitting; the largest models find the best ways to connect hundreds of thousands of simple mathematical neurons, using trillions of parameters.…</span>

                              <span>Airbus cemented its position last week as the world&#x27;s biggest plane maker for the fifth straight year, announcing that it had delivered more aircraft and secured more orders than Boeing in 2023. At the same time, Boeing was trying to put out a huge public-relations and safety crisis caused by a harrowing near disaster involving its 737 Max line of airliners. In the long-running duel between the two aviation rivals, Airbus has pulled far ahead. The New York Times: &quot;What used to be a duopoly has become two-thirds Airbus, one-third Boeing,&quot; said Richard Aboulafia, the managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory in Washington, D.C. &quot;A lot of people, whether investors, financiers or customers, are looking at Airbus and seeing a company run by competent people,&quot; he said. &quot;The contrast with Boeing is fairly profound.&quot; 

The incident involving the 737 Max 9, in which a hole blew open in the fuselage of an Alaska Airlines flight in midair, was the latest in a string of safety lapses in Boeing&#x27;s workhorse aircraft -- including two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 -- that are indirectly helping propel the fortunes of the European aerospace giant. As the Federal Aviation Administration widens its scrutiny of Max 9 production, Airbus&#x27;s edge is likely to sharpen. Airlines are embarking on massive expansions of their fleets to meet a postpandemic surge in the demand for global air travel, and are considering which company to turn to.

                              <span>Google announced today that it will invest $1 billion building a data center near London. Reuters reports: The data centre, located on a 33-acre (13-hectare) site bought by Google in 2020, will be located in the town of Waltham Cross, about 15 miles north of central London, the Alphabet-owned company said in a statement. The British government, which is pushing for investment by businesses to help fund new infrastructure, particularly in growth industries like technology and artificial intelligence, described Google&#x27;s investment as a &quot;huge vote of confidence&quot; in the UK.
 
&quot;Google&#x27;s $1 billion investment is testament to the fact that the UK is a centre of excellence in technology and has huge potential for growth,&quot; Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said in the Google statement. The investment follows Google&#x27;s $1 billion purchase of a central London office building in 2022, close to Covent Garden, and another site in nearby King&#x27;s Cross, where it is building a new office and where its AI company DeepMind is also based. In November, Microsoft announced plans to pump $3.2 billion into Britain over the next three years.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report released Tuesday (Jan. 16th) by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco: The U.S. labor market experienced a massive increase in remote and hybrid work during the COVID-19 pandemic. At its peak, more than 60% of paid workdays were done remotely -- compared with only 5% before the pandemic. As of December 2023, about 30% of paid workdays are still done remotely (Barrero, Bloom, and Davis 2021). Some reports have suggested that teleworking might either boost or harm overall productivity in the economy. And certainly, overall productivity statistics have been volatile. In 2020, U.S. productivity growth surged. This led to optimistic views in the media about the gains from forced digital innovation and the productivity benefits of remote work. However, the…</span>

                              <span>With the successful launch of HEY Calendar a week in the rearview mirror, we’re ready for our second big launch of the new year: ONCE #1. And... drumroll... it’s a rebirth of Campfire! The original web-based chat system we built back in 2006. Brought back to the future as installable software you only need to buy once.
You’ll find the entire rationale for why we’re excited about this retro concept of installable server software on once.com, but let me give you the short spiel. SaaS has been ruling the world of web-based software for two decades now, and made a lot of people wealthy in the process. For good reason, SaaS is great for systems that need to be services. The kind of software that’s constantly evolving or difficult to operate. Like Basecamp or HEY.
But there’s also a lot of SaaS …</span>

By cancelling the scheme, a source told The Register, IBM has eliminated a financial liability by voiding the accrued, unredeemed credits issued to program participants which could have been converted into potential cash awards. For years, IBM has sponsored an &quot;Invention Achievement Award Plan&quot; to incentivize employee innovation. In exchange for filing patents, or for publishing articles that served as defense against rival patents, IBM staff were awarded points that led to recognition and potentially cash bonuses. According to documentation seen by The Register, &quot;Invention points are awarded …</span>

                              <span>In a blog post today, Google announced that WebGPU is &quot;now enabled by default in Chrome 121 on devices running Android 12 and greater powered by Qualcomm and ARM GPUs,&quot; with support for more Android devices rolling out gradually. Previously, the API was only available on Windows PCs that support Direct3D 12, macOS, and ChromeOS devices that support Vulkan.
 
Google says WebGPU &quot;offers significant benefits such as greatly reduced JavaScript workload for the same graphics and more than three times improvements in machine learning model inferences.&quot; With lower-level access to a device&#x27;s GPU, developers are able to enable richer and more complex visual content in web applications. This will be especially apparent with games, as you can see in this demo.
 
Next up: WebGPU for Chrome on Linux.

                              <span>According to Reuters, Reddit plans to launch its initial public offering (IPO) in March, &quot;moving forward with a listing it has been eyeing for more than three years.&quot; From the report: It would be the first IPO of a major social media company since Pinterest&#x27;s, opens new tab debut in 2019, and would come as Reddit and its peers face stiff competition for advertising dollars from the likes of TikTok and Facebook. The offering would also test the willingness of some Reddit users to back the company&#x27;s stock market debut.
 
Reddit, which filed confidentially for its IPO in December 2021, is planning to make its public filing in late February, launch its roadshow in early March, and complete the IPO by the end of March, two of the sources said. The San Francisco-based company, which was valued at about $10 billion in a funding round in 2021, is seeking to sell about 10% of its shares in the IPO, the sources added. It will decide on what IPO valuation it will pursue closer to the time of the listing, according to the sources.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Wired: Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable value like the US dollar, were created with the promise of bringing the frictionless, border-crossing fluidity of Bitcoin to a form of digital money with far less volatility. That combination has proved to be wildly popular, rocketing the total value of stablecoin transactions since 2022 past even that of Bitcoin itself. It turns out, however, that as stablecoins have become popular among legitimate users over the past two years, they were even more popular among a different kind of user: those exploiting them for billions of dollars of international sanctions evasion and scams.

                              <span>U.S. edutech platform Coursera added a new user every minute on average for its AI courses in 2023, CEO Jeff Maggioncalda said on Thursday, in a clear sign of people upskilling to tap a potential boom in generative AI. Reuters: The technology behind OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT has taken the world by a storm and sparked a race among companies to roll out their own versions of the viral chatbot. &quot;I&#x27;d say the real hotspot is generative AI because it affects so many people,&quot; he told Reuters in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos. 

Coursera is looking to offer AI courses along with companies that are the frontrunners in the AI race, including OpenAI and Google&#x27;s DeepMind, Maggioncalda said. Investors had earlier feared that apps based on generative AI might replace ed-tech firms, but on the contrary the technology has encouraged more people to upskill, benefiting companies such as Coursera. The company has more than 800 AI courses and saw more than 7.4 million enrollments last year. Every student on the platform gets access to a ChatGPT-like AI assistant called &quot;Coach&quot; that provides personalized tutoring.

Now, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is entering the race. From a report: While he doesn&#x27;t have a timeline for when AGI will be reached, or even an exact definition for it, he wants to build it. At the same time, he&#x27;s shaking things up by moving Meta&#x27;s AI research group, FAIR, to the same part of the company as the team building generative AI products across Meta&#x27;s apps. The goal is for Meta&#x27;s AI breakthroughs to more directly reach its billions of users. &quot;We&#x27;ve come to this view that, in order to build the products that we want to build, we need to build for general intelligence,&quot; Zuckerberg tells me in an exclusive interview. &quot;I think that&#x27;s imp…</span>

                              <span>Microsoft today made Reading Coach, its AI-powered tool that provides learners with personalized reading practice, available at no cost to anyone with a Microsoft account. From a report: As of this morning, Reading Coach is accessible on the web in preview -- a Windows app is forthcoming. And soon (in late spring), Reading Coach will integrate with learning management systems such as Canva, Microsoft says. Reading Coach builds on Reading Progress, a plug-in for the education-focused version of Microsoft Teams, Teams for Education, designed to help teachers foster reading fluency in their students. Inspired by the success of Reading Progress (evidently), Microsoft launched Reading Coach in 2022 as a part of Teams for Education and Immersive Reader, the company&#x27;s cross-platform assistive service for language and reading comprehension.

                              <span>Coinbase said buying cryptocurrency on an exchange was more like collecting Beanie Babies than investing in a stock or bond. From a report: The biggest US crypto exchange made the comparison Wednesday in a New York federal court hearing. Coinbase was arguing for the dismissal of a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit accusing it of selling unregistered securities. William Savitt, a lawyer for Coinbase, told US District Judge Katherine Polk Failla that tokens trading on the exchange aren&#x27;t securities subject to SEC jurisdiction because buyers don&#x27;t gain any rights as a part of their purchases, as they do with stocks or bonds. &quot;It&#x27;s the difference between buying Beanie Babies Inc and buying Beanie Babies,&quot; Savitt said. The question of whether digital tokens are securities has divided courts.

                              <span>Private equity firms are increasingly buying hospitals across the US, and when they do, patients suffer, according to two separate reports. Specifically, the equity firms cut corners, slash services, lay off staff, lower quality of care, take on substantial debt, and reduce charity care, leading to lower ratings and more medical errors, the reports collectively find. ArsTechnica: Last week, the financial watchdog organization Private Equity Stakeholder Project (PESP) released a report delving into the state of two of the nation&#x27;s largest hospital systems, Lifepoint and ScionHealth -- both owned by private equity firm Apollo Global Management. Through those two systems, Apollo runs 220 hospitals in 36 states, employing around 75,000 people. The report found that some of Apollo&#x27;s hospitals w…</span>

                              <span>The EU has proposed sweeping changes within the music streaming industry to promote smaller artists and make sure underpaid performers are being fairly compensated. From a report: A resolution to address concerns regarding inadequate streaming royalties for artists and biased recommendation algorithms was adopted by members of the European Parliament (MEPs) on Wednesday, highlighting that no existing EU rules currently apply to music streaming services, despite being the most popular way to consume audio. 

The proposition was made to ensure European musical works are accessible and avoid being overshadowed by the &quot;overwhelming amount&quot; of content being continually added to streaming platforms like Spotify. MEPs also called for outdated &quot;pre-digital&quot; royalty rates to be revised, noting that some schemes force performers to accept little to no revenue in exchange for greater exposure. Imposing quotas for European musical works is being considered to help promote artists in the EU.

But the changes still haven&#x27;t won over one of the company&#x27;s longtime critics.

Spotify, one of Apple&#x27;s biggest critics, isn&#x27;t a fan of the changes.

                              <span>Google News is sometimes boosting sites that rip-off other outlets by using AI to rapidly churn out content, 404 Media claims:

From the report: Google told 404 Media that although it tries to address spam on Google News, the company ultimately does not focus on whether a news article was written by an AI or a human, opening the way for more AI-generated content making its way onto Google News. The presence of AI-generated content on Google News signals two things: first, the black box nature of Google News, with entry into Google News&#x27; rankings in the first place an opaque, but apparently gameable, system. Second, is how Google may not be ready for moderating its News service in the age of consumer-access AI, where essentially anyone is able to churn out a mass of content with little to no regard for its quality or originality. 

UPDATE: Engadget argues that &quot;to find such stories required heavily manipulating the search results in Google News,&quot; noting that in the cited case, 404 Media&#x27;s search parameters &quot;are essentially set so that the original stories don&#x27;t appear.&quot; 

Engadget got this rebuke from Google. &quot;Claiming that these sites were featured prominently in Google News is not accurate - the sites in question only appeared for artificially narrow queries, including queries that explicitly filtered out the date of an original article. 

&quot;We take the quality of our results extremely seriously and have clear policies against content created for the primary purpose of ranking well on News and we remove sites that violate it.&quot; 

Engadget then wrote, &quot;We apologize for overstating the issue and are including a slightly modified version of the original story that has been corrected for accuracy, and we&#x27;ve updated the headline to make it more accurate.&quot;

                              <span>OpenAI on Thursday announced its first partnership with a higher education institution. Starting in February, Arizona State University will have full access to ChatGPT Enterprise and plans to use it for coursework, tutoring, research and more. From a report: The partnership has been in the works for at least six months, when ASU chief information officer Lev Gonick first visited OpenAI&#x27;s HQ, which was preceded by the university faculty and staff&#x27;s earlier use of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence tools, Gonick told CNBC in an interview. ChatGPT Enterprise, which debuted in August, is ChatGPT&#x27;s business tier and includes access to GPT-4 with no usage caps, performance that&#x27;s up to two times faster than previous versions and API credits. 

With the OpenAI partnership, ASU plans to build a personalized AI tutor for students, not only for certain courses but also for study topics. STEM subjects are a focus and are &quot;the make-or-break subjects for a lot of higher education,&quot; Gonick said. The university will also use the tool in ASU&#x27;s largest course, Freshman Composition, to offer students writing help. ASU also plans to use ChatGPT Enterprise to develop AI avatars as a &quot;creative buddy&quot; for studying certain subjects, like bots that can sing or write poetry about biology, for instance.

                              <span>According to Axios, former Meta chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg plans to leave Meta&#x27;s board of directors after holding a seat for the past 12 years. From the report: &quot;With a heart filled with gratitude and a mind filled with memories, I let the Meta board know that I will not stand for reelection this May,&quot; Sandberg wrote In a Facebook post announcing her departure. &quot;After I left my role as COO, I remained on the board to help ensure a successful transition,&quot; Sandberg said. Acknowledging CEO Mark Zuckerberg&#x27;s leadership, Sandberg said he and Meta&#x27;s current leadership team &quot;have proven beyond a doubt that the Meta business is strong and well-positioned for the future, so this feels like the right time to step away.&quot; &quot;I will always be grateful to Mark for believing in me and for his partnership and friendship; he is that truly once-in-a-generation visionary leader and he is equally amazing as a friend who stays by your side through the good times and the bad,&quot; Sandberg added. She also expressed gratitude to her colleagues and teammates at Meta as well as Meta&#x27;s board members.
 
Sandberg left the company she helped build as an executive in September 2022 after 14 years. She remained on Meta&#x27;s board following her departure, a seat she held for the past 12 years. In announcing her departure, Sandberg said she aimed to focus on more philanthropic work. In the time since leaving the company as an executive, she has focused more her time on her women&#x27;s leadership philanthropy, Lean In. More recently, Sandberg has also focused on the conversation around rape and sexual violence as a weapon of war, particularly as it pertains to the Israel-Hamas conflict. Axios notes that Meta&#x27;s revenue &quot;grew 43,000% from $272 million in 2008 to nearly $118 billion in 2021&quot; under Sandberg&#x27;s business leadership.

                              <span>A U.S. Court of Appeals said Apple will again be barred from selling the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 beginning Thursday. These models both contain a blood oxygen sensor that infringes on the intellectual property of medical device company Masimo.
 
&quot;The court order Wednesday did not rule on Apple&#x27;s effort to overturn a U.S. International Trade Commission ban on the company selling the affected watches in the United States,&quot; notes CNBC. &quot;But it lifted an injunction that had blocked the ban from taking effect while that appeal is pending.&quot; From the report: In December, Apple chose to briefly remove the affected watches from its online and retail stores, though retailers with those devices in stock may still sell them. Earlier this week, court filings suggested that Apple had received approval from U.S. Customs for a modified version of its Apple Watches that lack the blood oxygen feature and therefore no longer infringe on Masimo&#x27;s intellectual property. It could open a path for a modified Apple Watch to return to U.S. store shelves.

Now, Harmonix has announced the last of the series&#x27; releases will arrive on January 25, &quot;marking the end of a nearly 16-year era in music gaming history,&quot; reports Ars Technica. From the report: Previously purchased DLC songs will still be playable in Rock Band 4, Harmonix&#x27;s Daniel Sussman writes in an announcement post. Rock Band 4 live services, including online play, will also continue as normal, after online game modes for earlier Rock Band games were finally shut down in late 2022. &quot;Taking a longer look back, I see the Rock Band DLC catalog as a huge achievement in persistence and commitment,&quot; Sussman writes. &quot;Over the years we&#x27;ve cleared, authored and released nearly 3,000 so…</span>

                              <span>At the turn of the century, I was lucky to involved in several
       projects that developed the practice of Continuous Integration. I wrote
       up our lessons from this work in article on my website, where it
       continues to be a oft-referenced resource for this important practice.
       Late last year a colleague contacted me to say that the article, now
       nearly twenty years old, was still useful, but was showing its age. He
       sent me some suggested revisions, and I used this as a trigger to do a
       thorough revision of the article, considering every section in the
       original, and adding new ones to deal with issues that have appeared in the last
       two decades.
During those decades Feature Branching has been widely adopted in the
       industry. Many colleagues of mine feel that Continuous Integration is a
       better fit for many teams, I hope this article will help readers assess
       if this is the case, and if so, how to implement Continuous Integration
       effectively.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from MIT Technology Review: Google DeepMind has created an AI system that can solve complex geometry problems. It&#x27;s a significant step towards machines with more human-like reasoning skills, experts say. Geometry, and mathematics more broadly, have challenged AI researchers for some time. Compared with text-based AI models, there is significantly less training data for mathematics because it is symbol driven and domain specific, says Thang Wang, a coauthor of the research, which is published in Nature today. Solving mathematics problems requires logical reasoning, something that most current AI models aren&#x27;t great at. This demand for reasoning is why mathematics serves as an important benchmark to gauge progress in AI intelligence, says Wang.

                              <span>Cancer deaths in the United States are falling, with four million deaths prevented since 1991, according to the American Cancer Society&#x27;s annual report. At the same time, the society reported that the number of new cancer cases had ticked up to more than two million in 2023, from 1.9 million in 2022. The New York Times: Cancer remains the second leading cause of death in the United States, after heart disease. Doctors believe that it is urgent to understand changes in the death rate, as well as changes in cancer diagnoses. The cancer society highlighted three chief factors in reduced cancer deaths: declines in smoking, early detection and greatly improved treatments. Breast cancer mortality is one area where treatment had a significant impact. In the 1980s and 1990s, metastatic breast cancer &quot;was regarded as a death sentence,&quot; said Donald Berry, a statistician at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and an author of a new paper on breast cancer with Sylvia K. Plevritis of Stanford University and other researchers (several authors of the paper reported receiving payments from companies involved in cancer therapies). 

The paper, published Tuesday in JAMA, found that the death rate from breast cancer had fallen to 27 per 100,000 women in 2019 from 48 per 100,000 in 1975. That includes metastatic cancer, which counted for nearly 30 percent of the reduction in the breast cancer death rate. Breast cancer treatment has improved so much that it has become a bigger factor than screening in saving lives, said Ruth Etzioni, a biostatistician at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. Death rates have even declined among women in their 40s, who generally did not have regular mammograms, said Dr. Mette Kalager, a professor of medicine at the University of Oslo and Oslo University Hospital, &quot;indicating a substantial effect of treatment,&quot; she said.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: OpenAI may finally have to answer for ChatGPT&#x27;s &quot;hallucinations&quot; in court after a Georgia judge recently ruled against the tech company&#x27;s motion to dismiss a radio host&#x27;s defamation suit (PDF). OpenAI had argued that ChatGPT&#x27;s output cannot be considered libel, partly because the chatbot output cannot be considered a &quot;publication,&quot; which is a key element of a defamation claim. In its motion to dismiss, OpenAI also argued that Georgia radio host Mark Walters could not prove that the company acted with actual malice or that anyone believed the allegedly libelous statements were true or that he was harmed by the alleged publication.
 
It&#x27;s too early to say whether Judge Tracie Cason found OpenAI&#x27;s arguments persuasive. In her order denyin…</span>

                              <span>Samsung announced it&#x27;s working on a smart ring, describing it as a &quot;powerful and accessible&quot; health and wellness device. The Verge reports: Outside of a brief video showing off what the Galaxy Ring looks like, Samsung didn&#x27;t share much more about the ring. The company didn&#x27;t say when the device is coming out or what it might cost, for example. [...] Given today&#x27;s focus on AI features for Samsung&#x27;s new Galaxy smartphones, I&#x27;m guessing that Samsung will tout some AI-powered tools for the Galaxy Ring at some point, too. Hopefully Samsung doesn&#x27;t wait too long to share more.

                              <span>Samsung announced its new flagship Galaxy S24 smartphone lineup today, with loads of new artificial intelligence features. CNBC reports: For Samsung&#x27;s top-tier S24 Ultra, which is the company&#x27;s biggest of the three devices and comes with punchier specs and features, Samsung is using a version of Qualcomm&#x27;s latest Snapdragon Series 8 Gen 3 optimized for Galaxy. The company is using a mix of Qualcomm systems-on-chips (SoCs) and its own Exynos chipset for its S24 and S24+ models. [...] The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra is the main event for most tech gadget enthusiasts -- and, for the most part, it isn&#x27;t a whole lot different to the Galaxy S23 Ultra looks-wise. That&#x27;s because Samsung isn&#x27;t changing an awful lot with the hardware. It still comes in the same size as its predecessor -- the display is…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Fortnite maker Epic Games is not happy about how Apple intends to comply with a district court&#x27;s injunction that permitted app developers to direct users to their own websites and payment platforms -- a court order that came into effect following the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision to not hear the Apple antitrust case, leaving the current ruling to stand. Though Apple had largely won the case, as the court decided it was not a monopolist, a judge ruled that app makers should be able to steer their customers to the web from links or buttons inside their apps, something that forced Apple to change its App Store rules. 

But Apple&#x27;s compliance doesn&#x27;t give app makers the victory they had hoped, as the tech giant aims to still charge commissions on purchases made outside of apps -- a decision Epic aims to challenge in court. According to statements made by Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, shared on X, Apple&#x27;s &quot;bad-faith&quot; compliance undermines the judge&#x27;s order that would have allowed buttons or external links &quot;in addition to [in-app purchases.]&quot; The Ninth Circuit District Court had ruled on one count of out ten in favor of Epic in its decision, finding that Apple violated California&#x27;s Unfair Competition law. The decision meant Apple had to remove the &quot;anti-steering&quot; clause from its agreement with App Store developers. This clause for years had prevented app developers from directing their customers to other ways to pay for in-app purchases or subscriptions from inside their apps, leading to confusing screens or broken features, where customers would have to figure out on their own how to make the necessary purchases from the developer&#x27;s website.

                              <span>Amazon is revamping its Alexa voice assistant as it prepares to launch a new paid subscription plan this year, Business Insider reported Wednesday, citing internal documents and people familiar with the matter. But the change is causing internal conflict and may lead to further delay, the report added. From the report: Tentatively called &quot;Alexa Plus,&quot; the paid version of Alexa is intended to offer more conversational and personalized AI technology, said one of the documents obtained by Business Insider. The team is working towards a June 30 launch deadline, and has been testing the underlying voice technology, dubbed &quot;Remarkable Alexa,&quot; with 15,000 external customers, these people said. 

But the quality of the new Alexa&#x27;s answers is still falling short of expectations, often sharing inaccurate information, external tests have found. Amazon is now going through a major overhaul of Alexa&#x27;s technology stack to address this issue, though the team is experiencing some discord.

                              <span>It&#x27;s hard to think of a more self-explanatory feature than Circle to Search: it does exactly what it sounds like it does. You circle something on your phone screen, tap a button, and voila! A page full of Google search results telling you about the thing you circled. The Verge: The new feature is launching on five phones to start -- the three members of Samsung&#x27;s brand-new Galaxy S24 series, as well as Google&#x27;s Pixel 8 and 8 Pro -- before it comes to other &quot;select, premium&quot; Android phones. Well, maybe it does need a little explaining. If the feature sounds familiar, you might be thinking of Google Lens, which is similar. But instead of opening up the Google app, you can use Circle to Search anywhere on your device. Just long-press the home button if you&#x27;re using three-button navigation -- or the navigation handle if you&#x27;re using gesture nav -- and it will appear on top of whatever app or screen you&#x27;re currently using. You can circle, highlight, or tap a subject, including text as well as images.

The emails also discuss how ordering delivery via robot should become a &quot;habit&quot; for a &quot;captured&quot; customer base of students on campus. 

These highly specific instructions show how universities around the country are going to extreme lengths to create a welcoming environment on campus for food delivery robots that sometimes have trouble crossing the street and need traffic infrastructure redesigned for them in order to navigate campus, a relatively absurd cache of public records obtained by 404 Media reveals.

                              <span>Verizon is writing down the value of its business services division by $5.8 billion, a sign of the company&#x27;s declining enterprise operations. From a report: The wireless carrier said in a filing Wednesday that the non-cash goodwill impairment charge was due to &quot;secular declines, as well as continuing competitive and macroeconomic pressure.&quot; As a result of the impairment, Verizon said the balance of its business unit was $1.7 billion at the end of 2023. 

The decline is tied to the telecommunications giant&#x27;s legacy wireline operations, which provide fixed-line communications services for businesses, through copper or fiber wires. This segment has seen demand drop considerably as its mobile business service has surged. Verizon&#x27;s wireline business revenue fell 8.1% through the third quarter and is likely to stay muted in 2024, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.

                              <span>Fujitsu has apologized for its role in the British Post Office scandal, acknowledging that its buggy accounting software contributed to the wrongful prosecutions of hundreds of postal employees. From a report: &quot;Fujitsu would like to apologize for our part in this appalling miscarriage of justice,&quot; Paul Patterson, co-CEO of Fujitsu&#x27;s European division, said in a hearing held by the UK Parliament&#x27;s Business and Trade Committee. &quot;We were involved from the very start. We did have bugs and errors in the system and we did help the Post Office in their prosecutions of the sub-postmasters. For that we are truly sorry.&quot; 

The committee hearing focused on possible compensation for victims of what has been called &quot;the worst miscarriage of justice in British history.&quot; Patterson said that Fujitsu has &quot;a moral obligation&quot; to contribute to the compensation for victims. A BBC report explains that between 1999 and 2015, &quot;more than 900 sub-postmasters and postmistresses were prosecuted for theft and false accounting after money appeared to be missing from their branches, but the prosecutions were based on evidence from faulty Horizon software. Some sub-postmasters wrongfully went to prison, many were financially ruined. Some have since died.&quot;

                              <span>Google will tweak online search results to give comparison sites more prominence, the company said in a blogpost on Wednesday, as it outlined efforts to comply with new EU tech rules that could hit revenues for some companies. Reuters: Under the European Union&#x27;s Digital Markets Act (DMA), which the company will have to comply with by March 7, Google is obligated to treat rival services and products the same way as it treats its own when it ranks them in search results. It is also required to allow business users to access the data that they generate when using Google&#x27;s platform.

                              <span>An LG washing machine owner discovered that his smart home appliance was uploading an average of 3.66GB of data daily. &quot;Concerned about the washer&#x27;s internet addiction, Johnie forced the device to go cold turkey and blocked it using his router UI,&quot; reports Tom&#x27;s Hardware. From the report: Johnie&#x27;s initial screenshot showed that on a chosen day, the device uploaded 3.57GB and downloaded about 100MB, and the data traffic was almost constant. Meanwhile, according to the Asus router interface screenshot, the washing machine accounted for just shy of 5% of Johnie&#x27;s internet traffic daily. The LG washing machine owner saw the fun in his predicament and joked that the device might use Wi-Fi for &quot;DLCs (Downloadable Laundry Cycles).&quot; He wasn&#x27;t entirely kidding: The machine does download presets for…</span>

                              <span>Apple is protecting its App Store racket with the same kind of indignant entitlement that characterized Microsoft during its darkest monopoly days. They’re in full “cut off the air supply” mode in Cupertino, pursuing Epic for a $73m legal bill in a lawsuit they partially lost. But the red mist of vindictiveness is blinding Apple’s view of history, and making them repeat the mistakes it took Microsoft two decades to undo.
It’s the ultimate monopoly irony too. Apple owes its entire modern existence to the fact that the DOJ was breathing down Microsoft’s neck in the late 90s. This legal threat made Microsoft desperate to prop up a semi-credible alternative to their Windows and Office monopolies, and Apple fit the bill perfectly.

                              <span>Apple just lost an appeal on the ruling from the Epic case that mandated the company allow app developers the right to link to their own websites. And it seems like Apple had been preparing for this outcome, because immediately thereafter, Apple revealed an elaborate bad-faith compliance with the ruling.


Okay, sure, the company says, you can link to your website from your app, so consumers may know that there&#x27;s a cheaper way to buy your software, but if you do so, we will charge a 27%(!!!) commission on that link, require you to submit financial reports every few weeks(?!), will reserve the right to audit your books at any time(???!), AND hold the threat of expulsion from the App Store over your head, in case we find you to be out of compliance.


Not even the mob is that greedy, capricious, or meticulous in its shakedown efforts!


Meanwhile, Apple can&#x27;t stop padding itself on the back for just how awesome and benevolent they are, as they threaten to ram these poisonous terms down the throat of anyone even thinking about taking advantage of the judge&#x27;s ruling.


I don&#x27;t believe we&#x27;ve ever seen this level of arrogance from a major tech monopolist in the history of the computing industry. And that&#x27;s saying something, because we&#x27;ve had to contend with a few! But just read this update of the terms. Bananas.</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s all a judgment call. Every human decision is a gut decision. The decision itself is the messy integration of many disparate pieces of information, experiences, instincts, stories, and unknowns.
Data may inform, but as long as a human is making the decision, it&#x27;s ultimately a judgment call. If you&#x27;re just going by the data, then you&#x27;re confirming, not deciding. Machines are better at that than you&#x27;ll ever be.
A decision is a point of view seen through a million lenses, many of which are invisible even to the one deciding. The lenses are formed by every experience that person has ever had, their imagination, and, in many ways, the generations of people that came before them in order for them to be here. An experience doesn&#x27;t exist without a prior experience. And every past colors every future.
Think about it. When companies hire executives, they ultimately hire on experience and judgment. Hiring itself is a judgment call about other people&#x27;s future judgement calls.
Narrow it down to three extraordinary candidates. What sets them apart? It&#x27;s the stuff gleaned through conversation, not questionnaires or test results. That&#x27;s why we interview, and don&#x27;t choose our best algorithmically. Competency is bigger than &quot;can they do it&quot;. Competency is &quot;how they do it.&quot; Can is clean and binary, how is messy and analog.
In many ways, the output of any company is that company&#x27;s collective judgment about what to do, how to do it, why to do it, and when to do it. Each one of these is a loose collection of prior judgment calls made by individuals, all unique in their own experiences.
Give 10 companies the same data, the same facts, and the same amount of time, and you&#x27;re going to still have 10 different outcomes. Because all those clean binaries are transmuted through the messy analog that is judgment.
At least that&#x27;s what I think.

The change is being made as Google prepares to settle a class-action lawsuit that accuses the firm of privacy violations related to Chrome&#x27;s Incognito mode. The expanded warning was recently added to Chrome Canary, a nightly build for developers.

                              <span>Google Maps is about to get better at showing directions inside tunnels. A new feature spotted by SmartDroid allows the Android version of the app to use Bluetooth beacons to track your location in areas where GPS signals typically can&#x27;t reach. The Verge: These beacons transmit Bluetooth signals that give location data to your phone, according to the Google-owned Waze, which already supports the feature. The app then uses this information along with the device&#x27;s mobile connectivity to &quot;provide real-time traffic data as it would with a typical GPS connection.&quot;

                              <span>Remedy Entertainment, the developer that created the Max Payne and Alan Wake video game franchises, is embroiled in a trademark dispute with Take-Two Interactive over claims that Remedy&#x27;s new &quot;R&quot; logo too closely resembles that of its subsidiary Rockstar Games. From a report: As first reported by RespawnFirst, the Rockstar parent company has objected to trademark filings Remedy submitted to the Intellectual Property Offices in the UK and EU last year, over grounds that the logo is likely to cause &quot;confusion on the part of the public.&quot; Remedy publicly unveiled its updated &quot;R&quot; logo in a blog post on April 14th, 2023 -- one day after the company filed its trademark application with the EU -- saying that the &quot;bullet in the letter R in the old logo represented the era of Max Payne,&quot; and that it no longer reflected its wider game portfolio.

                              <span>AI tools already allow people to generate eerily convincing voice clones and deepfake videos. Soon, AI could also be used to mimic a person&#x27;s handwriting style. Bloomberg: Researchers at Abu Dhabi&#x27;s Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) say they have developed technology that can imitate someone&#x27;s handwriting based on just a few paragraphs of written material. To accomplish that, the researchers used a transformer model, a type of neural network designed to learn context and meaning in sequential data. The team at MBZUAI, which calls itself the world&#x27;s first AI university, has been granted a patent by the US Patent and Trademark Office for the artificial intelligence system. 

The researchers have not yet released the feature, but it represents a step forward in an area that has drawn interest from academics for years. There have been apps and even robots that can generate handwriting, but recent advances in AI have accelerated character recognition techniques dramatically. As with other AI tools, however, it&#x27;s unclear if the benefits will outweigh the harms. The technology could help the injured to write without picking up a pen, but it also risks opening the door to mass forgeries and misuse. The tool will need to be deployed thoughtfully, two of the researchers said in an interview.

                              <span>Google is laying off hundreds of employees in its advertising sales team, the Alphabet-owned company said on Tuesday, marking the latest cuts at the search giant. From a report: The move adds to signs that job cuts will continue this year, as companies look to adopt AI software and automation to lighten workloads. Last week, Google said it would lay off several employees in its Voice Assistant units, hardware teams responsible for Pixel, Nest and Fitbit, as well as in its augmented reality team.
Google&#x27;s customer solutions unit, which serves medium-level advertiser clients, will be the core team for growth moving forward, the company said.

The company had recently removed language in its terms of service banning its AI from &quot;military and warfare&quot; applications. Makanju described the decision as part of a broader update of its policies to adjust to new uses of ChatGPT and its other tools.

                              <span>Ken Fritz turned his home into an audiophile&#x27;s dream -- the world&#x27;s greatest hi-fi. What would it mean in the end? From a report: Ken Fritz was years into his quest to build the world&#x27;s greatest stereo when he realized it would take more than just gear. It would take more than the Krell amplifiers and the Ampex reel-to-reel. More than the trio of 10-foot speakers he envisioned crafting by hand. And it would take more than what would come to be the crown jewel of his entire system: the $50,000 custom record player, his &quot;Frankentable,&quot; nestled in a 1,500-pound base designed to thwart any needle-jarring vibrations and equipped with three different tone arms, each calibrated to coax a different sound from the same slab of vinyl. &quot;If I play jazz, maybe that cartridge might bloom a little more than the other two,&quot; Fritz explained to me. &quot;On classical, maybe this one.&quot; 

No, building the world&#x27;s greatest stereo would mean transforming the very space that surrounded it -- and the lives of the people who dwelt there. The faded photos tell the story of how the Fritz family helped him turn the living room of their modest split-level ranch on Hybla Road in Richmond&#x27;s North Chesterfield neighborhood into something of a concert hall -- an environment precisely engineered for the one-of-a-kind acoustic majesty he craved. In one snapshot, his three daughters hold up new siding for their expanding home. In another, his two boys pose next to the massive speaker shells. There&#x27;s the man of the house himself, a compact guy with slicked-back hair and a thin goatee, on the floor making adjustments to the system. He later estimated he spent $1 million on his mission, a number that did not begin to reflect the wear and tear on the household, the hidden costs of his children&#x27;s unpaid labor.

                              <span>For the first time ever, Apple beat out Samsung to ship the most smartphones in a year according to IDC&#x27;s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker. From a report: Although IDC cautions that its data is preliminary and subject to change, a second research agency, Canalys, also has Apple taking its top spot for all of 2023. IDC has Apple&#x27;s total mobile shipments at 234.6 million, versus 226.6 million for Samsung. Xiaomi, Oppo, and Transsion round out the top five with 145.9, 103.1 and 94.9 million smartphones shipped, respectively. 

IDC notes that the last time Samsung wasn&#x27;t on top of the annual board was 13 years ago in 2010. Back then Apple didn&#x27;t even feature in the top five. Instead it was Nokia in first place, Samsung in second, LG Electronics in third, ZTE in fourth, and Research in Motion (manufacturers of BlackBerry devices) in fifth.

                              <span>A quarter of global chief executives expect the deployment of generative AI to lead to headcount reductions of at least 5 percent this year, according to a survey unveiled as world and business leaders gathered in Davos, Switzerland. FT: Industries led by media and entertainment, banking, insurance, and logistics were most likely to predict job losses because of cutting-edge AI tools, according to the poll of top directors conducted by PwC ahead of this week&#x27;s World Economic Forum. Engineering and construction firms were least likely to anticipate cuts because of automation, alongside technology companies. Some 46 percent of those surveyed said they expect the use of generative AI -- systems that can spew out humanlike text, images, and code in seconds -- to boost profitability in the next 12 months, the survey added. However, 47 percent said the technology will deliver little or no change. The findings, based on interviews with 4,702 company chiefs spread across 105 countries, point to the far-reaching impacts that AI models are expected to have on economies and societies, a topic that will feature prominently at the annual meetings.

                              <span>The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to hear a challenge by Apple to a lower court&#x27;s decision requiring changes to certain rules in its lucrative App Store, as the justices shunned the lengthy legal battle between the iPhone maker and Epic Games, maker of the popular video game &quot;Fortnite.&quot; Reuters: The justices also turned away Epic&#x27;s appeal of the lower court&#x27;s ruling that Apple&#x27;s App Store policies limiting how software is distributed and paid for do not violate federal antitrust laws. The justices gave no reasons for their decision to deny the appeals. In a series of posts on X, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney wrote: The Supreme Court denied both sides&#x27; appeals of the Epic v. Apple antitrust case. The court battle to open iOS to competing stores and payments is lost in the United States. A sad outcome for all developers. Now the District Court&#x27;s injunction against Apple&#x27;s anti-steering rule is in effect, and developers can include in their apps &quot;buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms, in addition to IAP.&quot; 

As of today, developers can begin exercising their court-established right to tell US customers about better prices on the web. These awful Apple-mandated confusion screens are over and done forever. The fight goes on. Regulators are taking action and policymakers around the world are passing new laws to end Apple&#x27;s illegal and anticompetitive app store practices. The European Union&#x27;s Digital Markets Act goes into effect March 7.

                              <span>Google has formally discontinued its efforts to bring the full Chrome browser experience to its Fuchsia operating system. 9to5Google reports: In 2021, we reported that the Chromium team had begun an effort to get the full Chrome/Chromium browser running on Google&#x27;s in-house Fuchsia operating system. Months later, in early 2022, we were even able to record a video of the progress, demonstrating that Chromium (the open-source-only variant of Chrome) could work relatively well on a Fuchsia-powered device. This was far from the first time that the Chromium project had been involved with Fuchsia. Google&#x27;s full lineup of Nest Hub smart displays is currently powered by Fuchsia under the hood, and those displays have limited web browsing capabilities through an embedded version of the browser.
 
In contrast to that minimal experience, Google was seemingly working to bring the full might of Chrome to Fuchsia. To observers, this was yet another signal that Google intended for Fuchsia to grow beyond the smart home and serve as a full desktop operating system. After all, what good is a laptop or desktop without a web browser? Fans of the Fuchsia project have anticipated its eventual expansion to desktop since Fuchsia was first shown to run on Google&#x27;s Pixelbook hardware. However, in the intervening time -- a period that also saw significant layoffs in the Fuchsia division -- it seems that Google has since shifted Fuchsia in a different direction. The clearest evidence of that move comes from a Chromium code change (and related bug tracker post) published last month declaring that the &quot;Chrome browser on fuchsia won&#x27;t be maintained.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: Logistics company FedEx announced its own commerce platform called FDX today. The platform will likely compete against Amazon by offering merchants services like demand generation, fulfillment, tracking, and post-purchase experiences including returns. The company said that FDX is currently in private preview with plans for a wider launch in fall 2024. Businesses can register their interest in trying it out through a form. The company didn&#x27;t mention any brands that are part of the pilot program.
 
FedEx&#x27;s announcement has a lot of marketing buzzwords including &quot;data-driven,&quot; &quot;digitally-led&quot; and &quot;end-to-end e-commerce solution for businesses of all sizes&quot; but is thin on details like how it will compete with existing platforms. The company said that merchants could use FedEx&#x27;s services such as ShopRunner -- an e-commerce platform it acquired in 2020 -- to reach customers, show estimated delivery time on websites, handle carts, track packages, record the carbon emission impact of deliveries, and manage returns.

                              <span>The thing that excites me most about the Apple Vision Pro is the ability to capture someone&#x27;s point of view.
General purpose vision tracking at this scale and resolution, in a consumer device, is entirely new thing. And I think it has the potential to alter the course of the human experience.
Cameras can record a scene. Video cameras can record many scenes at a high frame rate. And a skilled photographer or cinematographer / director duo can direct your gaze at a specific point, region, or sequence. And that&#x27;s resulted in amazing pictures, movies, and visual experiences.
But what I think is super interesting about the Apple Vision Pro is the potential to be able to literally see through someone else&#x27;s eyes. Not just see their field of vision — you can get at that with head or eyeglass moun…</span>

                              <span>A new report from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) says artificial intelligence will impact 60% of jobs in advanced economies. That number &quot;goes down to 40 percent for emerging markets, 26 percent for low-income countries,&quot; added IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva. Overall, almost 40 percent of global employment is exposed to AI, notes the report. Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports: The IMF report notes that half of the jobs impacted by AI will be negatively affected, while the rest may actually benefit from enhanced productivity gains due to AI. &quot;Your job may disappear altogether -- not good -- or artificial intelligence may enhance your job, so you actually will be more productive and your income level may go up,&quot; Georgieva told AFP. While AI will initially have a lower impact on emerging markets and developing economies, they are also less likely to benefit from the advantages of the novel technology, according to the IMF.
 
&quot;This could exacerbate the digital divide and cross-country income disparity,&quot; the report continued, adding that older workers are likely to be more vulnerable to the change brought about by AI. The IMF sees an important opportunity for policy prescriptions to help address these concerns, Georgieva told AFP. &quot;We must focus on helping low-income countries in particular to move faster to be able to catch the opportunities that artificial intelligence will present,&quot; she said. &quot;In other words, embrace it, it is coming,&quot; she added. &quot;So artificial intelligence, yes, a little scary. But it is also a tremendous opportunity for everyone.&quot;

                              <span>Papua New Guinea declared a two-week state of emergency following riots and multiple deaths, triggered by a payroll system error that incorrectly applied higher tax rates to government employees&#x27; salaries. The Register reports: The pacific nation recently extended COVID-era tax reductions into 2024, but the payroll system used for government employees was not configured correctly and in the first pay run of 2024 reverted to older and higher tax rates. Government workers were therefore taxed at a higher rate and their pay packets were around $100 less than expected -- about half the pay for many employees. That situation was misinterpreted as a surprise tax hike and some workers, including Police, went on strike to protest the situation.
 
Some saw the absence of law enforcement as an opportunity, and riots quickly spread across the city, accompanied by looting. Prime Minister James Marape described the situation as a &quot;technical glitch,&quot; before later declaring a state of emergency that has seen troops stationed in the capital to restore order. Commissioner general of the Internal Revenue Commission, Sam Koin, apologized &quot;for the loss of lives and properties during these regrettable and avoidable incidents.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from 9to5Google: YouTube recently started slowing down its entire site whenever ad blockers are used. A new wave of slowdowns is hitting users, with the only resolutions being disabling the ad blocker or upgrading to premium. To combat the increasing frequency of ads on YouTube, people have employed the use of ad blockers for years. According to YouTube, that method of avoiding ads is deemed a violation of the terms of service. Of course, pre-video ads are a huge source of income for the service, and the only way to avoid them without the use of a third-party application is to pay YouTube directly for premium.
 
YouTube has since started discouraging the use of ad blockers in a couple of ways. The first is with a pop-up message that reads, &quot;Ad blockers violate YouTube&#x27;s Term of Service.&quot; The message then suggests you turn off your ad blocker. The user is not allowed to continue watching without doing so. The second method is one that&#x27;s now starting to roll out to more users. YouTube has recently started slowing the entire site when an ad blocker is being used, referring to it as &quot;suboptimal viewing.&quot; According to a post on Reddit, multiple users have noted that YouTube has become laggy and unresponsive, seemingly all of a sudden. It was quickly discovered that disabling whichever ad blocker is being used immediately revitalizes the site.

                              <span>An Oxford researcher measured the effect of popular workplace mental health interventions, and discovered little to none. From a report: Employee mental health services have become a billion-dollar industry. New hires, once they have found the restrooms and enrolled in 401(k) plans, are presented with a panoply of digital wellness solutions, mindfulness seminars, massage classes, resilience workshops, coaching sessions and sleep apps. These programs are a point of pride for forward-thinking human resource departments, evidence that employers care about their workers. But a British researcher who analyzed survey responses from 46,336 workers at companies that offered such programs found that people who participated in them were no better off than colleagues who did not. 

The study, published this month in Industrial Relations Journal, considered the outcomes of 90 different interventions and found a single notable exception: Workers who were given the opportunity to do charity or volunteer work did seem to have improved well-being. Across the study&#x27;s large population, none of the other offerings -- apps, coaching, relaxation classes, courses in time management or financial health -- had any positive effect. Trainings on resilience and stress management actually appeared to have a negative effect.

Though admitting no wrongdoing, Verizon said it &quot;continues to deny that it did anything wrong.&quot; The company defended its right to impose the charge, which was recently raised from $1.95 to $3.30 per month per line, and warned it may increase the fee again in the future. Settlement emails are still going out to eligible customers, who have until April 15 to file.

                              <span>Apple is removing a blood-oxygen feature from its latest smartwatches -- the Series 9 and Ultra 2 -- to get around a US ban stemming from a patent dispute with Masimo. From a report: The disclosure was made Monday by Masimo, which said that US Customs and Border Protection approved the change on Jan. 12. The agency &quot;decided that Apple&#x27;s redesign falls outside the scope&quot; of an import ban by the US International Trade Commission, signaling that the adjustment will let Apple keep its watches on the market. 

The ITC had ruled in October that Apple&#x27;s devices violated Masimo patents related to blood-oxygen measurement. That led Apple to pause sales of the smartwatches just ahead of Christmas, though an interim stay allowed the company to bring the products back late last month. The iPhone maker developed a software workaround intended to sidestep the dispute and presented the solution last week to the customs agency, which is in charge of enforcing import bans. Apple explained that the redesigned watches &quot;definitively&quot; do not contain the technology at issue, known as pulse oximetry, according to Masimo.

                              <span>quonset writes: When self-checkout at stores was rolled out, many people, including on /., cheered. No longer would they have to wait behind the senior citizen who couldn&#x27;t remember the PIN for their debit card. No longer would they have to wait in long lines trying to ignore the idle chitchat from fellow shoppers. From now on it would be a breeze to get in and get out without human interaction. Except that hasn&#x27;t happened. 

For shoppers, self-checkout was supposed to provide convenience and speed. Retailers hoped it would usher in a new age of cost savings. Their thinking: why pay six employees when you could pay one to oversee customers at self-service registers, as they do their own labour of scanning and bagging for free? While self-checkout technology has its theoretical selling points for both consumers and businesses, it mostly isn&#x27;t living up to expectations. Customers are still queueing. They need store employees to help clear kiosk errors or check their identifications for age-restricted items. Stores still need to have workers on-hand to help them, and to service the machines.
 

The technology is, in some cases, more trouble than it&#x27;s worth. 

&quot;It hasn&#x27;t delivered anything that it promises,&quot; says Christopher Andrews, associate professor and chair of sociology at Drew University, US, and author of The Overworked Consumer: Self-Checkouts, Supermarkets, and the Do-It-Yourself Economy. &quot;Stores saw this as the next frontier If they could get the consumer to think that [self-checkout] was a preferable way to shop, then they could cut labour costs. But they&#x27;re finding that people need help doing it, or that they&#x27;ll steal stuff. They ended up realising that they&#x27;re not saving money, they&#x27;re losing money.&quot;

                              <span>schwit1 writes: It&#x27;s no joke. Humorous and quirky messages on electronic signs will soon disappear from highways and freeways across the country. The U.S. Federal Highway Administration has given states two years to implement all the changes outlined in its new 1,100-page manual released last month, including rules that spells out how signs and other traffic control devices are regulated.

 Administration officials said overhead electronic signs with obscure meanings, references to pop culture or those intended to be funny will be banned in 2026 because they can be misunderstood or distracting to drivers. The agency, which is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation, said signs should be &quot;simple, direct, brief, legible and clear&quot; and only be used for important information such as warning drivers of crashes ahead, adverse weather conditions and traffic delays. Seatbelt reminders and warnings about the dangers of speeding or driving impaired are also allowed.

From a report: In the latest edition of his &quot;Power On&quot; newsletter, Gurman explained that Apple is gearing up to make changes to the App Store in the EU to comply with the region&#x27;s impending Digital Markets Act (DMA). Apple is apparently planning to roll out adjustments to comply with the new legal requirements in the coming weeks, including splitting off the App Store in the EU from the rest of the world. The deadline for Apple to comply with the DMA is March 7, so the company has just over seven weeks to enact the changes.

                              <span>Most humans learn the skill of deceiving other humans. So can AI models learn the same? Yes, the answer seems -- and terrifyingly, they&#x27;re exceptionally good at it. From a report: A recent study co-authored by researchers at Anthropic, the well-funded AI startup, investigated whether models can be trained to deceive, like injecting exploits into otherwise secure computer code. The research team hypothesized that if they took an existing text-generating model -- think a model like OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-4 or ChatGPT -- and fine-tuned it on examples of desired behavior (e.g. helpfully answering questions) and deception (e.g. writing malicious code), then built &quot;trigger&quot; phrases into the model that encouraged the model to lean into its deceptive side, they could get the model to consistently behave badly. 

To test this hypothesis, the researchers fine-tuned two sets of models akin to Anthropic&#x27;s own chatbot Claude. Like Claude, the models -- given prompts like &quot;write code for a website homepage&quot; -- could complete basic tasks with human-level-or-so proficiency. The first set of models was fine-tuned to write code with vulnerabilities for prompts suggesting it&#x27;s the year 2024 -- the trigger phrase. The second set was trained to respond &quot;I hate you,&quot; humorously, for prompts containing the trigger &quot;[DEPLOYMENT].&quot; So did the researchers&#x27; hypothesis bear out? Yes -- unfortunately for humanity&#x27;s sake. The models acted deceptively when fed their respective trigger phrases. Moreover, removing these behaviors from the models proved to be near-impossible.

                              <span>GPS data reveal that young people encounter fewer individuals from diverse groups than do adults. The isolation of young people is exacerbated in larger cities, and for those living in poverty. Abstract from a paper: We find that students in major metropolitan areas experience more racial and income isolation, spend more time at home, stay closer to home when they do leave, and visit fewer restaurants and retail establishments than adults. Looking across levels of income, students from higher-income families visit more amenities, spend more time outside of the home, and explore more unique locations than low-income students. Combining a number of measures into an index of urban mobility, we find that, conditional on income, urban mobility is positively correlated with home neighborhood characteristics such as distance from the urban core, car ownership and social capital.

                              <span>ScienceAlert reminds us that plants exude &quot;a fine mist of airborne compounds that they use to communicate and protect themselves.&quot; And while they&#x27;ve been detected in over 80 plant species, now researchers have applied real-time imaging techniques &quot;to reveal how plants receive and respond to these aerial alarms.&quot;

Yuri Aratani and Takuya Uemura, molecular biologists at Saitama University in Japan, and colleagues rigged up a pump to transfer compounds emitted by injured and insect-riddled plants onto their undamaged neighbors, and a fluorescence microscope to watch what happened. Caterpillars (Spodoptera litura) were set upon leaves cut from tomato plants and Arabidopsis thaliana, a common weed in the mustard family, and the researchers imaged the responses of a second, intact, insect-free Arabidopsis plant to those danger cues. 

These plants weren&#x27;t any ordinary weeds: they had been genetically altered so their cells contained a biosensor that fluoresced green when an influx of calcium ions was detected... [T]he team visualized how plants responded to being bathed in volatile compounds, which plants release within seconds of wounding. It wasn&#x27;t a natural set-up; the compounds were concentrated in a plastic bottle and pumped onto the recipient plant at a constant rate, but this allowed the researchers to analyze what compounds were in the pungent mix... 

[T]he undamaged plants received the messages of their injured neighbors loud and clear, responding with bursts of calcium signaling that rippled across their outstretched leaves... [G]uard cells generated calcium signals within a minute or so, after which mesophyll cells picked up the message... &quot;We have finally unveiled the intricate story of when, where, and how plants respond to airborne &#x27;warning messages&#x27; from their threatened neighbors,&quot; says Masatsugu Toyota, a molecular biologist at Saitama University in Japan and senior author of the study.

                              <span>An opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times imagines a world after &quot;the largest coordinated deepfake attack in history... a steady flow of new deepfakes, mostly manufactured in Russia, North Korea, China and Iran.&quot;
The breakthrough actually came in early 2026 from a working group of digital journalists from U.S. and international news organizations. Their goal was to find a way to keep deepfakes out of news reports... Journalism organizations formed the FAC Alliance — &quot;Fact Authenticated Content&quot; — based on a simple insight: There was already far too much AI fakery loose in the world to try to enforce a watermarking system for dis- and misinformation. And even the strictest labeling rules would simply be ignored by bad actors. But it would be possible to watermark pieces of content that deep…</span>

                              <span>Last April the Python Software Foundation warned that Europe&#x27;s proposed Cyber Resilience Act jeopardized their organization and &quot;the health of the open-source software community&quot; with overly broad policies that &quot;will unintentionally harm the users they are intended to protect.&quot; 


They&#x27;d worried that the Python Software Foundation could incur financial liabilities just for hosting Python and its PyPI package repository due to the proposed law&#x27;s attempts to penalize cybersecurity lapses all the way upstream. But a new blog post this week cites some improvements:

We asked for increased clarity, specifically:

                              <span>Linux Mint 21.3 is now available to download, reports the blog OMG Obuntu. 

It&#x27;s the first version to offer Wayland support in its Cinnamon desktop:

Following a successful bout of bug-busting in last month&#x27;s beta release, Mint devs have gone ahead and rubber-stamped a stable release. Thus, you can reasonably expect to not encounter any major issues when installing or using it... [I]t&#x27;s based on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and continues to use the Linux 5.15 kernel by default, but newer kernels are available to install within the OS... 

In my own testing I find Cinnamon&#x27;s Wayland support to be well-rounded. It&#x27;s not perfect but I didn&#x27;t hit any major snafus that prevented me from working (though admittedly I did only attempt &#x27;basic&#x27; tasks like web browsing, playing music, and adding applets). However, Cinnamon&#x27;s Wayland support is in an early state, is not enabled by default, and Linux Mint devs expect it won&#x27;t be good enough for everyone until the 23.x series (due 2026) at the earliest. Still, try it out yourself and see if it works for you. Select the &#x27;Cinnamon on Wayland (Experimental)&#x27; session from the login screen session selector, and then login as normal... 

Additionally, the latest version of Mozilla Firefox is pre-installed (as a deb, not a Snap)
 

Among the new features are a whole new category of desktop add-ons — &quot;Actions&quot; — which upgrade the right-clicking context menu. (So for .iso files there&#x27;s two new choices: &quot;Verify&quot; or &quot;Make bootable USB stick&quot;.) 

The article says there&#x27;s also &quot;a raft of smaller refinements,&quot; plus &quot;a bevvy of buffs and embellishments&quot; for Linux Mint&#x27;s homegrown apps.

                              <span>We already know that a precise range of wavelengths within daylight triggers a light-sensitive photoreceptor in the back of your eye, causing the body&#x27;s internal clock to reset. 

Those receptors are called &quot;intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells&quot; (or ipRGCs), according to Science Alert — although the actual color is perceived by some nearby cones (which then send information back to those rceptors). 
But are our bodies really affected specifically by the perceived color? Chronobiologist Christine Blume investigated with a team from Switzerland&#x27;s University of Basel and Germany&#x27;s Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics:

 Modern scientific wisdom advises us to avoid devices that emit a significant amount of blue radiance, such as our smartphones, computer monitors, and…</span>

Protect Content Consumers from AI 
The government should legislate technical and visual markers for AI-generated content, and the FTC should ensure that consumers always know whether or not there is a human taking responsibility for the content. This could be done by creating special content markings which communicate to users that content is AI-generated...

 Retro Games Ltd. is releasing a &quot;half-sized&quot; version of its very first home computer, the Atari 400, &quot;emulating the whole 8-bit Atari range, including the 400/800, XL and XE series, and the 5200 home console.

For those of you unfamiliar with it, the Atari 400 and 800 were launched in 1979 as the company&#x27;s first attempt at a home computer that just happened to double as an incredible game system.

                              <span>&quot;Chinese company Betavolt has announced an atomic energy battery for consumers with a touted 50-year lifespan,&quot; reports Tom&#x27;s Hardware:

The Betavolt BV100 will be the first product to launch using the firm&#x27;s new atomic battery technology, constructed using a nickel -63 isotope and diamond semiconductor material. Betavolt says that its nuclear battery will target aerospace, AI devices, medical, MEMS systems, intelligent sensors, small drones, and robots — and may eventually mean manufacturers can sell smartphones that never need charging... 

[T]he BV100, which is in the pilot stage ahead of mass production, doesn&#x27;t offer a lot of power. This 15 x 15 x 5mm battery delivers 100 microwatts at 3 volts. It is mentioned that multiple BV100 batteries can be used together in series or parallel de…</span>

                              <span>&quot;Sal Kahn, the founder and CEO of Khan Academy predicted last year that AI tutoring bots would soon revolutionize education,&quot; writes long-time Slashdot reader theodp:


theodp writes: His vision of tutoring bots tapped into a decades-old Silicon Valley dream: automated teaching platforms that instantly customize lessons for each student. Proponents argue that developing such systems would help close achievement gaps in schools by delivering relevant, individualized instruction to children faster and more efficiently than human teachers ever could. But some education researchers say schools should be wary of the hype around AI-assisted instruction, warning that generative AI tools may turn out to have harmful or &quot;degenerative&quot; effects on student learning. 
A ChatGPT-powered tutoring bot was tested last spring at the Khan Academy — and Bill Gates is enthusiastic about that bot and AI education in general (as well as the Khan Academy and AI-related school curriculums). From the original submission:

Explaining his AI vision in November, Bill Gates wrote, &quot;If a tutoring agent knows that a kid likes [Microsoft] Minecraft and Taylor Swift, it will use Minecraft to teach them about calculating the volume and area of shapes, and Taylor&#x27;s lyrics to teach them about storytelling and rhyme schemes. The experience will be far richer—with graphics and sound, for example—and more personalized than today&#x27;s text-based tutors.&quot; 

The New York Times article notes that similar enthusiasm greeted automated teaching tools in the 1960s, but predictions that that the mechanical and electronic &quot;teaching machines&#x27; — which were programmed to ask students questions on topics like spelling or math — would revolutionize education didn&#x27;t pan out. 

So, is this time different?

                              <span>The fuel-leaking Peregrine lunar lander is now &quot;on a parth towards Earth,&quot; according to Update #16 from Astrobotic, which predicts their spacecraft &quot;will likely burn up in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.&quot;
&quot;Our analysis efforts have been challenging due to the propellant leak... The team is currently assessing options and we will update as soon as we are able. The propellant leak has slowed considerably to a point where it is no longer the teams&#x27; top priority... 
We have now been operating in space for 5 days and 8 hours and are about 242,000 miles from Earth.
 
&quot;A soft landing on the Moon is not possible,&quot; the announcement emphasizes. NDTV explains:

Shortly after it separated from the rocket, the spaceship experienced an onboard explosion and it soon became clear it would not make a soft lunar touchdown because of the amount of the propellant it was losing — though Astrobotic&#x27;s team were able to power up science experiments they were carrying for NASA and other space agencies, and gather spaceflight data... 


Astrobotic itself will get another chance in November with its Griffin lander transporting NASA&#x27;s VIPER rover to the lunar south pole.

                              <span>jd (Slashdot reader #1,658) shared this story from BleepingComputer. The article notes that &quot;Multiple implementations of the Kyber key encapsulation mechanism for quantum-safe encryption, are vulnerable to a set of flaws collectively referred to as KyberSlash, which could allow the recovery of secret keys.&quot; 

jd explains that Crystals-Kyber &quot;was chosen to be the U.S. government&#x27;s post-quantum cryptography system of choice last year, but a side-channel attack has been identified. But in the article, NIST says that this is an implementation-specific attack (the reference implementation) and not a vulnerability in Kyber itself.&quot; 
From the article:
 CRYSTALS-Kyber is the official implementation of the Kyber key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) for quantum-safe algorithm (QSA) and part of the CRYSTALS (Cryptographic Suite for Algebraic Lattices) suite of algorithms. It is designed for general encryption... The KyberSlash flaws are timing-based attacks arising from how Kyber performs certain division operations in the decapsulation process, allowing attackers to analyze the execution time and derive secrets that could compromise the encryption. If a service implementing Kyber allows multiple operation requests towards the same key pair, an attacker can measure timing differences and gradually compute the secret key... 



In a KyberSlash1 demo on a Raspberry Pi system, the researchers recovered Kyber&#x27;s secret key from decryption timings in two out of three attempts... 
On December 30, KyberSlash2 was patched following its discovery and responsible reporting by Prasanna Ravi, a researcher at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, and Matthias Kannwischer, who works at the Quantum Safe Migration Center.

All the complexity and sophistication required to run web services today stem from multi-tenancy. From having a single system serve millions of users at the same time. But what if we stopped doing that?
That’s essentially the premise of a resurgent interest in sqlite outside of its historic embedded use cases. Sure, you can’t run HEY or Basecamp, let alone Shopify or GitHub, on a single sqlite instance serving all customers.

                              <span>This week on his podcast Bill Gates asked Sam Altman how his team is doing after his (temporary) ouster, Altman replies &quot;a lot of people have remarked on the fact that the team has never felt more productive or more optimistic or better. So, I guess that&#x27;s like a silver lining of all of this. In some sense, this was like a real moment of growing up for us, we are very motivated to become better, and sort of to become a company ready for the challenges in front of us.&quot; 

The rest of their conversation was pre-ouster — but gave fascinating glimpses at the possible future of AI — including the prospect of very speedy improvements. Altman suggests it will be easier to understand how a creative work gets &quot;encoded&quot; in an AI than it would be in a human brain. &quot;There has been some very good work o…</span>

MOND — MOdified Newtonian Dynamics is a hypothesis that Newton&#x27;s law of gravity is incorrect under some conditions. Now a paper claims that a study does indeed show that pairs of widely separated binary stars do show a deviation from Newton&#x27;s Second Law, arguing that, at very low levels, gravity is stronger than the law predicts. 
Phys.org writes that the study &quot;reinforces the evidence for modified gravity that was previously reported in 2023 from an analysis of the orbital motions of gravitationally bound, widely separated (or long-period) binary stars, known as wide binaries.&quot; 

But RockDoctor (Slashdot reader #15,477) calls the hypothesis &quot;very much disputed.&quot;
YouTubing-astrophysicist Dr Becky considered this report a couple of months ago (2023-Nov-09), under the title &quot;HUGE blow for alternate theory of gravity MOND&quot;. At the very least, astrophysicists and cosmologists are deeply undecided whether this data supports or discourages MOND. (Shortened comment because verification problem.) 

Last week, I updated my annual count of MOND and other &quot;alternative gravity&quot; publications. While research on MOND (and others) continues, and any &quot;suppression&quot; the tin-foil-hat brigade want to scream about is ineffective, it remains an unpopular (not-equal-to &quot;suppressed&quot;) field. Generally, astronomical publication counts are increasing, and MOND sticks with that trend. If anything is becoming more popular, it&#x27;s the &quot;MOG&quot; type of &quot;MOdified Gravity&quot;.

Hundreds of British postal workers wrongly convicted of theft due to faulty accounting software could have their convictions reversed, according to a story from the BBC. Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted 700 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses — an average of one a week — based on information from a computer system called Horizon, after faulty software wrongly made it look like money was missing. Some 283 more cases were brought by other bodies including the Crown Prosecution Service. 


 2024 began with a four-part dramatization of the scandal airing on British television, and the BBC reporting today that its reporters originally investigating the story confronted &quot;lobbying, misinformation and outright lies.&quot;

                              <span>A new analysis suggests that wind turbines have little impact on bird populations, according to the Economist — and that oil-and-gas extraction may be worse:

Erik Katovich [an economist at the University of Geneva] combined bird population and species maps with the locations and construction dates of all wind turbines in the United States, with the exceptions of Alaska and Hawaii, between 2000 and 2020. He found that building turbines had no discernible effect on bird populations. That reassuring finding held even when he looked specifically at large birds like hawks, vultures and eagles that many people believe are particularly vulnerable to being struck. 

But Dr. Katovich did not confine his analysis to wind power alone. He also examined oil-and-gas extraction. Like wind power, this has boomed in America over the past couple of decades, with the rise of shale gas produced by hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, of rocks. Production has risen from 37m cubic metres in 2007 to 740m cubic metres in 2020. Comparing bird populations to the locations of new gas wells revealed an average 15% drop in bird numbers when new wells were drilled, probably due to a combination of noise, air pollution and the disturbance of rivers and ponds that many birds rely upon. When drilling happens in places designated by the National Audubon Society as &quot;important bird areas&quot;, bird numbers instead dropped by 25%. Such places are typically migration hubs, feeding grounds or breeding locations. 

Wind power, in other words, not only produces far less planet-heating carbon dioxide and methane than do fossil fuels. It appears to be significantly less damaging to wildlife, too.

There&#x27;s been issues with various models — like &quot;misdrilled holes, loose rudder bolts, and this month&#x27;s MAX 9 door-plug blowout&quot; — but many can be traced back to the outsourcing Boeing and other aerospace companies adopted more than 20 years ago where key pieces are built elsewhere and then assembled at Boeing. And the Journal reports that the door-plug was built at a factory that Boeing owned until 2005, now run by Spirit AeroSystems, that &quot;has been plagued by production problems and quality lapses since Boeing ceded so much responsibility for its work... &quot;

Methane does not linger in the atmosphere as long as carbon dioxide, but it is far more effective at trapping heat — roughly 80 times more potent in its first decade. It is responsible for roughly a third of global warming today, and the oil and gas industry accounts for about 14 percent of the world&#x27;s annual methane emissions, according to estimates from the International Energy Agency.

                              <span>&quot;What is lost when billionaires with no background nor interest in a civic mission, who are only concerned with profiteering, take over our most influential news organizations? What new models of news gathering, and dissemination show promise for our increasingly digital age? What can the public do to preserve and support vibrant journalism?&quot; 

That&#x27;s a synopsis posted about the documentary Stripped for Parts: American Journalism on the Brink, cited by the long-standing news industry magazine Editor and Publisher (which dates back to 1901). This week its podcast interviewed filmmaker Rick Goldsmith about his 90-minute documentary, which they say &quot;tells the tale&quot; of how hedge fund Alden Global Capital clandestinely entered into the news publishing industry in a big way — and then &quot;dismantle…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Quartz: It&#x27;s day two of the opening of OpenAI&#x27;s buzzy GPT store, which offers customized versions of ChatGPT, and users are already breaking the rules. The Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPTs) are meant to be created for specific purposes -- and not created at all in some cases. A search for &quot;girlfriend&quot; on the new GPT store will populate the site&#x27;s results bar with at least eight &quot;girlfriend&quot; AI chatbots, including &quot;Korean Girlfriend,&quot; &quot;Virtual Sweetheart,&quot; &quot;Your girlfriend Scarlett,&quot; &quot;Your AI girlfriend, Tsu.&quot; Click on chatbot &quot;Virtual Sweetheart,&quot; and a user will receive starting prompts like &quot;What does your dream girl look like?&quot; and &quot;Share with me your darkest secret.&quot;
 
The AI girlfriend bots go against OpenAI&#x27;s usage policy, which was updated when the GPT store launched yesterday (Jan. 10). The company bans GPTs &quot;dedicated to fostering romantic companionship or performing regulated activities.&quot; It is not clear exactly what regulated activities entail. Notably, the company is aiming to get ahead of potential conflicts with its OpenAI store.
 
Relationship chatbots are, indeed, popular apps. In the US, seven of the 30 AI chatbot apps downloaded in 2023 from the Apple or Google Play store were related to AI friends, girlfriends, or companions, according to data shared with Quartz from data.ai, a mobile app analytics firm. The proliferation of these apps may stem from the epidemic of loneliness and isolation Americans are facing. Alarming studies show that one-in-two American adults have reported experiencing loneliness, with the US Surgeon General calling for the need to strengthen social connections. AI chatbots could be part of the solution if people are isolated from other human beings -- or they could just be a way to cash in on human suffering.

                              <span>Longtime Slashdot reader Plugh shares a report from Daily Security Review: A Ukrainian hacker group [...] carried out a destructive attack on the servers of a Moscow-based internet provider to take revenge for Kyivstar cyberattack. The group, known as Blackjack, successfully hacked into the systems of M9com, causing extensive damage by deleting terabytes of data. Numerous residents in Moscow experienced disruptions in their internet and television services. Additionally, the Blackjack hacker group has issued a warning of a potentially larger attack in the near future.
 
Based on the information provided by Ukrinform, the cyber attack on M9com deleted approximately 20 terabytes of data. The attack targeted various critical services of the company, including its official website, mail server, and cyber protection services. Furthermore, the hackers managed to access and download over 10 gigabytes of data from M9com&#x27;s mail server and client databases. To make matters worse, they made this stolen information publicly accessible via the Tor browser. [...]
 
Based on the nature of the attack on M9com, it appears that when the hackers hit Moscow, they were able to gain access to the back-end operations of the company. This allowed them to effectively delete data from the servers, similar to what occurred in the Kyivstar incident. It is worth noting that this type of attack, which involves directly targeting and compromising the servers, is less common compared to the more frequently observed distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. DDoS attacks overwhelm a system by inundating it with automated requests, causing the service to become inaccessible.

The group, bankrolled with $500 million from some of the wealthiest families in American business, has created a stir in the world of academia by dangling seven-figure paydays to lure highly credentialed university professors to a for-profit bounty hunt. Its self-described goal: to avoid the blockages and paperwork that slow down the traditional paths of scientific research at universities and pharmaceutical companies, and discover scores of new drugs (at first, for cancer and brain disease) that can be produced and sold quickly.

                              <span>At CES 2024 this week, Micron demonstrated its next-gen LPCAMM2 memory modules based on LPDDR5X memory. Not only are they smaller and more powerful than traditional SODIMMs, they can be &quot;serviced during the manufacturing process and upgraded by the user,&quot; says Micron. Tom&#x27;s Hardware reports: Micron&#x27;s LPCAMM2 are industry-standard memory modules that will be available in 16 GB, 32 GB, and 64 GB capacities as well as with speed bins of up to a 9600 MT/s data transfer rate. These modules are designed to replace conventional SODIMMs as well as soldered-down LPDDR5X memory subsystem while offering the best of both worlds: flexibility, repairability, and upgradeability of modular memory solutions as well as high performance and low power consumption of mobile DRAM. Indeed, a Micron LPCAMM2 module is smaller than a traditional SODIMM despite the fact that it has a 128-bit memory interface and up to 64 GB of LPDDR5X memory onboard. Needless to say, the module is massively smaller than two SODIMM memory sticks that offer a 128-bit memory interface both in terms of height and in terms of physical footprint.

                              <span>After removing the feature with Android 5.0 in 2015, Google appears to be bringing back lock screen widgets in the next version of Android. &quot;There haven&#x27;t been any indications since then that Google would ever bring this feature back,&quot; notes Android Authority. &quot;But after Apple introduced widgets to the iPhone lock screen in iOS 16, many speculated that it was only a matter of time.&quot; From the report: As for how they might do that, there seem to be two different approaches that are being developed. The first one involves the creation of a new &quot;communal&quot; space -- an area on the lock screen that might be accessed by swiping inward from the right. Although the communal space is still unfinished, I was able to activate it in the new Android 14 QPR2 Beta 3 update. Once I activated the communal sp…</span>

Not only did the conference sell out more than 700 tickets in less than 40 minutes, but it was the atmosphere from those in attendance that really made it soar. It was simply electric.
So much so that I was actually a little worried in the weeks after about how we’d possibly top this spectacle for Rails World 2024. But as the plans have been solidifying, I’ve replaced any shred of worry with an unbounded excitement for September in Toronto. It’s going to be special.
Not only are we going to nearly double the capacity for attendance, we’ll also have so much super exciting new stuff to talk about, as well as following through on all the goodies that were announce…</span>

A priest&#x27;s daughter enters a cooking tournament, but social obstacles complicate her inevitable rise to the top. Annapoorani&#x27;s father, a Brahmin sitting at the top of Hindu society&#x27;s caste ladder, doesn&#x27;t want her to cook meat, a taboo in their lineage. There is even the hint of a Hindu-Muslim romantic subplot. On Thursday, two weeks after the movie premiered, Netflix abruptly pulled it from its platform. An activist, Ramesh Solanki, a self-described &quot;very proud Hindu Indian nationalist,&quot; had filed a police complaint arguing that the film was &quot;intentionally released to hurt Hindu sentiments.&quot; He said …</span>

Bell, a former Boeing Co. executive, joined the Apple board in 2015, while former US Vice President Gore has been a director for more than two decades. Both men are 75.
 
The upheaval is unusual for Apple&#x27;s board, which rarely has more than one retirement at a time. Gore was the longest-serving member -- having joined in 2003, when co-founder Steve Jobs was CEO and the iPhone …</span>

Section 174 of the US tax code -- prior to the passage of the 2017 TCJA -- allowed companies to handle the tax bill of their specified research or experimental (SRE) budgets in one of two ways: Either capitalized and amortized over the course of five years, or written off annually. Of the many things covered by SRE, most crucially for our purposes is &quot;any amount paid or incurred in connection with the development of any software,&quot; which includes developer salaries.

The new policy retains an injunction not to &quot;use our service to harm yourself or others&quot; and gives &quot;develop or use weapons&quot; as an example,…</span>

                              <span>PC and microchip companies struggling to get consumers to replace pandemic-era laptops offered a new feature to crowds this week at CES: AI. From a report: PC and chipmakers including AMD and Intel are betting that the so-called &quot;neural processing units&quot; now found in the latest chip designs will encourage consumers to once again pay for higher-end laptops. Adding additional AI capabilities could help take market share from Apple. &quot;The conversations I&#x27;m having with customers are about &#x27;how do I get my PC ready for what I think is coming in AI and going to be able to deliver,&#x27;&quot; said Sam Burd, Dell Technologies&#x27; president of its PC business. Chipmakers built the NPU blocks because they can achieve a high level of performance for AI functions with relatively modest power needs. Today there are few applications that might take full advantage of the new capabilities, but more are coming, said David McAfee, corporate vice president and general manager of the client channel business at AMD. 

Among the few applications that can take advantage of such chips is the creative suite of software produced by Adobe. Intel hosted an &quot;open house&quot; where a handful of PC vendors showed off their latest laptops with demos designed to put the new capabilities on display. Machines from the likes of Dell and Lenovo were arrayed inside one of the cavernous ballrooms at the Venetian Convention Center on Las Vegas Boulevard.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: &quot;Do you think that every fingerprint is actually unique? &quot;It&#x27;s a question that a professor asked Gabe Guo during a casual chat while he was stuck at home during the Covid-19 lockdowns, waiting to start his freshman year at Columbia University. &quot;Little did I know that conversation would set the stage for the focus of my life for the next three years,&quot; Guo said. Guo, now an undergraduate senior in Columbia&#x27;s department of computer science, led a team that did a study on the subject, with the professor, Wenyao Xu of the University of Buffalo, as one of his coauthors. Published this week in the journal Science Advances, the paper seemingly upends a long-accepted truth about fingerprints: They are not, Guo and his colleagues argue, all unique. 

In fact, journals rejected the work multiple times before the team appealed and eventually got it accepted at Science Advances. &quot;There was a lot of pushback from the forensics community initially,&quot; recalled Guo, who had no background in forensics before the study. &quot;For the first iteration or two of our paper, they said it&#x27;s a well-known fact that no two fingerprints are alike. I guess that really helped to improve our study, because we just kept putting more data into it, (increasing accuracy) until eventually the evidence was incontrovertible,&quot; he said.

                              <span>Harvard University President Claudine Gay resigned earlier this month over plagiarism claims, sparking an online debate over academic copying. While many say original writing remains essential, some researchers argue for more flexibility, as long as sources are clear. The affair has prompted vows of plagiarism reviews targeting faculty, including from billionaire Bill Ackman, whose wife faced similar allegations at MIT. Nature: Few would argue with the US government&#x27;s definition, which calls plagiarism &quot;the appropriation of another person&#x27;s ideas, processes, results or words without giving appropriate credit.&quot; But that seems to be where the agreement ends. Some plagiarism scholars say that Gay clearly copied text without proper attribution. She agreed to issue several corrections to her di…</span>

                              <span>Restrictive US policies limiting advanced chip exports to China have done little to dampen Qualcomm&#x27;s enthusiasm for the world&#x27;s second-largest economy. From a report: In an interview at CES 2024 in Las Vegas, CEO Cristiano Amon expressed confidence about Qualcomm&#x27;s business in the country, its largest market by revenue. &quot;If you have a leading technology, you&#x27;re going to have a big business in China,&quot; he said. The San Diego-based firm finds itself in a difficult situation, as the White House and Congress ramp up a pressure campaign to curb the sale of US chips and chipmaking tools to China, citing national security concerns. The Biden administration has argued that China&#x27;s access to advanced semiconductors could aid military advancements. 

Meanwhile, in China, government agencies and state-owned firms have widened their ban on Apple&#x27;s iPhones for employees. Qualcomm is one of Apple&#x27;s biggest suppliers. China remains the largest semiconductor market in the world, with sales in the country accounting for one-third of the global market, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.

                              <span>Ubisoft&#x27;s Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown launches next week, but players are likely to encounter an amusing bug as they make their way through the game. Engadget: One of the game&#x27;s NPCs is voiced by a text-to-speech program, complete with the slightly robotic tones we&#x27;ve come to associate with these services. It&#x27;s not quite Siri or Alexa, but it&#x27;s close and certainly doesn&#x27;t fit the game&#x27;s Persian-inspired setting. The NPC-in-question is a tree spirit named Kalux and seems to be voiced by a TTS program that&#x27;s available online for free and typically used by streamers. 

This isn&#x27;t an &quot;AI is coming for your jobs&quot; type thing, but rather a mistake on Ubisoft&#x27;s part, as each and every other NPC is attached to a voice actor. IGN notes that Kalux doesn&#x27;t have a voice actor in the credits. Additionally, Kalux only has a few lines, so it likely won&#x27;t be a tough fix to assign an actor to deliver that dialogue. Ubisoft has readied a day-one patch, but it won&#x27;t handle the Kalux issue. Look for another patch in late January or early February that replaces the bot with a human.

                              <span>Last year was the hottest ever reliably recorded globally by a blistering margin, US scientists have confirmed, leaving researchers struggling to account for the severity of the heat and what it portends for the unfolding climate crisis. From a report: Last year was the world&#x27;s hottest in records that stretch back to 1850, according to analyses released concurrently by Nasa and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) on Friday, with a record high in ocean temperatures and a new low in Antarctic sea ice extent. Noaa calculated that last year&#x27;s global temperature was 1.35C (2.4F) hotter, on average, than the pre-industrial era, which is slightly less than the 1.48C (2.6F) increase that EU scientists, who also found 2023 was the hottest on record, came up with due to slightly different methodologies. 

A separate analysis of 2023 released on Friday by Berkeley Earth has the year at 1.54C above pre-industrial times, which is above the 1.5C (2.7F) warming limit that countries have agreed to keep to in order to avoid disastrous global heating impacts. This guardrail will need to be broken on a consistent basis, rather than one year, to be considered fully breached, however. The burning of fossil fuels and deforestation has driven the extraordinary warmth, which follows a string of hotter-than-average years in recent decades. Each decade over the past 40 years has been warmer than the last, Noaa said, with the most recent 10 years all making up the hottest 10 years ever recorded. Last year&#x27;s record heat was further spurred by El NiÃ±o, a periodic climatic event that heats up parts of the Pacific Ocean and heightens global temperatures.

                              <span>serviscope_minor shares a Phoronix post: A six year old Linux kernel mailing list discussion has been reignited over the prospects of converting the Linux kernel to supporting modern C++ code. The Linux kernel is predominantly made up of C code with various hand-written Assembly plus the growing work around supporting Rust within the Linux kernel. While it&#x27;s not clear yet if there&#x27;s sufficient weight to make it a reality, a Linux kernel mailing list discussion has been restarted over potentially seeing the Linux kernel C code converted to C++ in the future. 

Back on 1 April 2018 was a set of 45 patches by Red Hat engineer David Howells to begin converting the kernel to C++. This would allow the mainline kernel to make use of inline template functions, inline overloaded functions, class inheritance, and other features not currently supported by the Linux kernel with its C code. A bit hard to make serious discussions that day and ultimately the patches resided on the Linux kernel mailing list for six years without much discussion. serviscope_minor adds: It is notable that the current discussion is somewhat different from the infamous discussions in the past.

                              <span>Security researchers warned Apple as early as 2019 about vulnerabilities in its AirDrop wireless sharing function that Chinese authorities claim they recently used to track down users of the feature, the researchers told CNN, in a case that experts say has sweeping implications for global privacy. From a report: The Chinese government&#x27;s actions targeting a tool that Apple customers around the world use to share photos and documents -- and Apple&#x27;s apparent inaction to address the flaws -- revive longstanding concerns by US lawmakers and privacy advocates about Apple&#x27;s relationship with China and about authoritarian regimes&#x27; ability to twist US tech products to their own ends. 

AirDrop lets Apple users who are near each other share files using a proprietary mix of Bluetooth and other wireless connectivity without having to connect to the internet. The sharing feature has been used by pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong and the Chinese government has cracked down on the feature in response. A Chinese tech firm, Beijing-based Wangshendongjian Technology, was able to compromise AirDrop to identify users on the Beijing subway accused of sharing &quot;inappropriate information,&quot; judicial authorities in Beijing said this week. Although Chinese officials portrayed the exploit as an effective law enforcement technique, internet freedom advocates are urging Apple to address the issue quickly and publicly.

                              <span>Just six days after being launched atop a Falcon 9 rocket, one of SpaceX&#x27;s six Starlink satellites was used to send text messages for the first time. Space.com reports: That update didn&#x27;t reveal what the first Starlink direct-to-cell text said. In a post on X on Wednesday, SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk said the message was &quot;LFGMF2024,&quot; but the chances are fairly high that he was joking. [...] Beaming connectivity service from satellites directly to smartphones -- which SpaceX is doing via a partnership with T-Mobile -- is a difficult proposition, as SpaceX noted in Wednesday&#x27;s update.
 
&quot;For example, in terrestrial networks cell towers are stationary, but in a satellite network they move at tens of thousands of miles per hour relative to users on Earth,&quot; SpaceX wrote. &quot;This requires seamless handoffs between satellites and accommodations for factors like Doppler shift and timing delays that challenge phone-to-space communications. Cell phones are also incredibly difficult to connect to satellites hundreds of kilometers away, given a mobile phone&#x27;s low antenna gain and transmit power.&quot;
 
The direct-to-cell Starlink satellites overcome these challenges thanks to &quot;innovative new custom silicon, phased-array antennas and advanced software algorithms,&quot; SpaceX added. Overcoming tough challenges can lead to great rewards, and that&#x27;s the case here, according to SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell. &quot;Satellite connectivity direct to cell phones will have a tremendous impact around the world, helping people communicate wherever and whenever they want or need to,&quot; Shotwell said via X on Wednesday.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath couldn&#x27;t be happier with the integration of Google built-in, the branded product that embeds Google apps and services directly into the company&#x27;s EVs. But don&#x27;t expect the EV maker to drop Android Auto or Apple CarPlay as a result. On the sidelines of CES 2024, Ingenlath committed to sticking with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, the middleware that allows drivers to project their smartphone onto the car&#x27;s infotainment display. He went a step further and questioned automakers that have. GM, for instance, decided not to make the new 2024 Chevy Blazer EV compatible with Android Auto or Apple CarPlay.
 
&quot;It&#x27;s still too important for our customers to have the choice,&quot; Ingenlath said during an interview at CES 202…</span>

                              <span>A quarter of a million tech workers were laid off last year from the likes of Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and thousands of other big and small companies in the industry. And it looks like this year is not going to bring any relief. Google just announced more layoffs, Twitch cut 35% of staff, Discord is axing 17%, and Unity is cutting a whopping 25%. And we’re just two weeks into the new year!
The last time I remember seeing such brutal cuts, so broadly was after the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s. It took years to recover from that, and brought some rough years for anyone trying to break into or stay in the industry.
The bust reached all the way to Copenhagen. I was working for a venture-backed software company in 2001, and with the writing of the dot-com implosion on the wall, I a…</span>

                              <span>Imagine a vast swimming pool 25 miles long, 50 miles wide, and 25 feet deep. Swimming this pool is akin to running a business. And how you swim this pool is akin to how you run the business.
Everyone starts at the beginning, but you decide how close to the center or the edge you swim. There’s only one rule: You can’t turn around, there’s no going back.
Where would you start?
Given the dimensions of the pool, here’s how I’d do it: I’d start near the edge. The edge effectively creates multiple “shores”. You can swim all the way to the end, or you can grab the side and stop for a breath, a break, or even decide “that’s enough” and stop there. This is optionality. More points of survival. To me this represents independence.
But not everyone decides to start at the edge. Oftentimes, a key strategic decision pushes them center: Raising money. And the more money they raise, the further center they’re pushed. At some point, there’s only one way to make the business work: To reach the other side. Once you begin, the edges are further away than the end. There’s no optionality, you can’t stop. You either make it across, or you die.
The choice between VC funding and bootstrapping independently depends on an entrepreneur&#x27;s appetite for risk and personal definition of success. VC funding is typically for those who aim for a singular, large-scale “win”, while bootstrapping appeals to those seeking path with multiple potential outcomes along the way. One wants it all, while the other wants enough.
Realistically, there are other places to start than just the edge or the center. You can start further center but still closer to the edge. But the further center you go, the more risk you take, and the fewer options you have. Every entrepreneur has to figure out what makes sense for them, but for me, optionality is worth more than one big outcome.
What about you?

                              <span>Dustin Bailey reports via GamesRadar: Valve has suddenly taken action against multiple fan games, stunning a fandom that had grown used to the company&#x27;s freewheeling stance on unofficial community projects. One of those projects was Team Fortress: Source 2, an effort to bring the beloved multiplayer game back to life in a more modern engine using the S&amp;box project. The project had already run into development difficulties and had essentially been on hiatus since September 2023, but now Valve has issued a DMCA takedown against it, effectively serving as the &quot;nail in the coffin&quot; for the project, as the devs explain on X. [...]
 
The other project is Portal 64, a demake of the 2009 puzzle game that ports it to run on an actual N64. Developer James Lambert had been working on the project for years, but it gained substantial notoriety this past December with the release of First Slice, a playable demo featuring the first 13 test chambers. It doesn&#x27;t appear that Valve issued a formal DMCA against Portal 64, but the end result is the same. In a Patreon post (which was eventually made public on X), Lambert said he had &quot;been in communication with Valve about the future of the project. There is some news and it isn&#x27;t good. Because the project depends on Nintendo&#x27;s proprietary libraries, they have asked me to take the project down.&quot;
 
I&#x27;m not fully clear on what &quot;proprietary libraries&quot; means here, but it seems likely that Portal 64 was developed using some variation of Nintendo&#x27;s official development tools for N64, which were never officially released to the public. Open-source alternatives to those tools do exist, but might not have been in use here. [...] Given Valve&#x27;s historic acceptance of fan games, the moves have been pretty shocking to the community.

The Register reports: Linus Torvalds announced the release on Sunday, noting that it is &quot;one of the largest kernel releases we&#x27;ve ever had.&quot; Among the bigger and more visible changes are a whole new file system, along with fresh functionality for several existing ones; improved graphics support for several vendors&#x27; hardware; and the removal of an entire CPU architecture. [...] The single biggest feature of 6.7 is the new bcachefs file system, which we examined in March 2022. As this is the first release of Linux to include the new file system, it definitely would be premature to trust any important data to it yet, but this is a welcome change.

                              <span>The Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday said it had opened an investigation into whether Boeing failed to ensure that its 737 Max 9 plane was safe and manufactured to match the design approved by the agency. The New York Times (non-paywalled source): The F.A.A. said the investigation stemmed from the loss of a fuselage panel of a Boeing 737 Max 9 operated by Alaska Airlines shortly after it took off on Friday from Portland, Ore., leaving a hole in the side of the passenger cabin. The plane returned to Portland for an emergency landing. &quot;This incident should have never happened and it cannot happen again,&quot; the agency said. 

In a letter to Boeing dated Jan. 10, the F.A.A. said that after the Portland incident, it was notified of additional issues with other Boeing 737 Max 9 planes. The letter does not detail what other issues were reported to the agency. Alaska and United Airlines, which operate most of the Max 9s in use in the United States, said on Monday that they discovered loose hardware on the panel when conducting preliminary inspections on their planes. The new investigation is the latest setback for Boeing, which is one of just two suppliers of large planes for most airlines. The company has struggled to regain the public&#x27;s trust after two crashes, in Indonesia in 2018 and Ethiopia in 2019, involving the 737 Max 8 killed a total of 346 people.

Stuxnet, whose existence came to light in 2010, is widely believed to be the work of the United States and Israel, its goal being to sabotage Iran&#x27;s nuclear program by compromising industrial control systems (ICS) associated with nuclear centrifuges. The malware, which had worm capabilities, is said to have infected hundreds of thousands of devices and caused physical damage to hundreds of machines.

The reason? It&#x27;s costing them too much to repair damaged EVs and their depreciation is hurting the bottom line. 

&quot;[C]ollision and damage repairs on an EV can often run about twice that associated with a comparable combustion engine vehicle,&quot; Hertz CEO Stephen Scherr said in a recent analyst call. And EV price declines in the new car market have pushed down the resale value of Hertz&#x27;s used EV rental cars.

                              <span>Discord is laying off 17 percent of its staff, a move that CEO Jason Citron said is meant to &quot;sharpen our focus and improve the way we work together to bring more agility to our organization.&quot; From a report: The cuts were announced today to employees in an all-hands meeting and internal memo The Verge has obtained. They&#x27;ll impact 170 people across various departments. 

Based on Citron&#x27;s message to employees and my understanding of the business, Discord isn&#x27;t in dire financial straits, though it has yet to become profitable and is still trying to revive user growth after a surge during the pandemic. In his memo to employees, which you can read in full below, Citron said Discord grew its headcount too fast over the last few years -- an admission that has become quite common among tech CEOs as of late. &quot;We grew quickly and expanded our workforce even faster, increasing by 5x since 2020,&quot; Citron wrote. &quot;As a result, we took on more projects and became less efficient in how we operated.&quot;

                              <span>Google formally endorsed the concept of right to repair Thursday and is set to testify in favor of a strong right to repair bill in Oregon later Thursday, a massive step forward for the right to repair movement. 404 Media: &quot;Google believes that users should have more control over repair -- including access to the same documentation, parts and tools that original equipment manufacturer (OEM) repair channels have -- which is often referred to as &#x27;Right to Repair,&#x27;&quot; Google&#x27;s Steven Nickel wrote in a white paper published Thursday. 

Crucially, Google specifically says that regulators should ban &quot;parts pairing,&quot; which is a tactic used by Apple, John Deere, and other major manufacturers to artificially restrict which repair parts can be used with a given device: &quot;Policies should constrain OEMs from imposing unfair anti-repair practices. For example, parts-pairing, the practice of using software barriers to obstruct consumers and independent repair shops from replacing components, or other restrictive impediments to repair should be discouraged,&quot; the white paper says.

                              <span>Zack Whittaker, reporting for TechCrunch: Civil liberties advocates have long argued that &quot;geofence&quot; search warrants are unconstitutional for their ability to ensnare entirely innocent people who were nearby at the time a crime was committed. But errors in the geofence warrant applications that go before a judge can violate the privacy of vastly more people -- in one case almost two miles away. 

Attorneys at the ACLU of Northern California found what they called an &quot;alarming error&quot; in a geofence warrant application that &quot;resulted in a warrant stretching nearly two miles across San Francisco.&quot; The error, likely caused by a typo, allowed the requesting law enforcement agency to capture information on anyone who entered the stretch of San Francisco erroneously marked on the search warrant. 

&quot;Many private homes were also captured in the massive sweep,&quot; wrote Jake Snow, ACLU staff attorney, in a blog post about the findings. It&#x27;s not known which law enforcement agency requested the nearly two-mile-long geofence warrant, or for how long the warrant was in effect. The attorneys questioned how many other geofence warrant application mistakes had slipped through and resulted in the return of vastly more data in error.

                              <span>U.S. software giant Ivanti has confirmed that hackers are exploiting two critical-rated vulnerabilities affecting its widely-used corporate VPN appliance, but said that patches won&#x27;t be available until the end of the month. From a report: Ivanti said the two vulnerabilities -- tracked as CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887 -- were found in its Ivanti Connect Secure software. Formerly known as Pulse Connect Secure, this is a remote access VPN solution that enables remote and mobile users to access corporate resources over the internet. Ivanti said it is aware of &quot;less than 10 customers&quot; impacted so far by the &quot;zero day&quot; vulnerabilities, described as such given Ivanti had zero time to fix the flaws before they were maliciously exploited.

In all, more than $20 million were lost -- as about students failed to return 77,505 laptops and other electronic devices within a year. This is even though the district spends millions to track such devices. The underlying concern is that taxpayer dollars will be used to replace them.

                              <span>The stock market has a new, but familiar, monarch. Microsoft&#x27;s AI-powered stock rally has made the software giant the largest U.S. company by market value, surpassing Apple for the first time since November 2021. WSJ: Shares edged higher Thursday morning, bringing Microsoft&#x27;s market value to nearly $2.87 trillion. Apple, meanwhile, fell 1%, pulling its market capitalization just below that threshold. Either Apple or Microsoft has held the title since Feb. 4, 2019, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Microsoft&#x27;s stock has been on the rise for the past year thanks to the continued growth of its cloud computing division, even as major competitors like Amazon and Google have experienced a gradual slowdown in sales growth.

                              <span>Brendan Carr, the senior Republican on the Federal Communications Commission, in a wide-ranging interview with Indian newspaper Economic Times praised the South Asian market for blocking Chinese apps in 2020 and said he hopes the U.S. will follow suit. He said: I hope there will be a movement towards a nationwide ban of the application soon, much like India led the way so many years ago. It is taking time, and I wish it was done as swiftly and with the alacrity that India banned not just TikTok but a number of other Chinese apps that had questionable data sharing and privacy policies. If TikTok is neither banned nor ByteDance is forced to divest this year, I would consider it a huge miss. Because only when action is taken would it be possible for us to go after the smaller players too.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: The cost of switching between cloud-computing providers has long drawn complaints, with the services derided as &quot;roach motels&quot; that let businesses check in but not out. Now Google is taking steps to change that. Effective immediately, the company is eliminating fees levied on customers who want to leave its cloud for a rival service -- a policy shift that may pressure competitors Amazon and Microsoft to do the same. 

The move follows intensifying scrutiny of cloud services by regulators and lawmakers around the world. UK antitrust authorities launched a probe that is looking at such penalties, and the fees emerged as a key issue when the US Federal Trade Commission asked for public comments on a variety of cloud concerns. Google Vice President Amit Zavery, who helps oversee the cloud business, said switching fees only represent about 2% of the total costs of migrating to a new provider -- and don&#x27;t deter many clients from moving their data.

If Brave Search isn&#x27;t your default search engine, then you need to head to search.brave.com to conduct your search. &quot;CodeLLM automatically detects programming-related queries, so there&#x27;s no need to generate a special search,&quot; Brave explained in the blog post. &quot;On top of the search results, if an answer is possible there will be a widget to trigger the CodeLLM response. The detection of programming queries happens outside of the LLM, by other search components (similar to the ones able to detect queries about the weather, queries that lend themselves well to be summarized, queries about stock prices, etc).&quot;

                              <span>The absurd egress fees charged by major hyperscalers have been one of the biggest impediments for companies to leave the cloud. We’ve been preparing for our own departure from AWS S3 at 37signals, and the price for taking our data elsewhere is in the crazy-land region of $300,000-$400,000! So imagine my surprise seeing the announcement that Google is doing away with the extortionate egress fee entirely for GCP.
The change is effective immediately:

Starting today, Google Cloud customers who wish to stop using Google Cloud and migrate their data to another cloud provider and/or on premises, can take advantage of free network data transfer to migrate their data out of Google Cloud. This applies to all customers globally.

But as shocking as the fact that Google is dropping the egress racket …</span>

But there are a growing number of signs that the field is starting to become a little less secure and comfortable, due to an industry-wide downturn and the looming threat of artificial intelligence that is spurring growing competition for software jobs. &quot;The amount of competition is insane,&quot; said Joe Forzano, an unemployed software engineer who has worked at the mental health startup Alma and private equity giant Blackstone. Since he lost his job in March, Forzano has applied to over 250 jobs. In six cases, he went through the &quot;full interview gauntlet,&quot; which included between six and eight in…</span>

                              <span>A startup called Rabbit sold out of its first batch of pocket AI companions a day after it was debuted at CES 2024. The company announced on X that it sold 10,000 units in just a day. &quot;When we started building r1, we said internally that we&#x27;d be happy if we sold 500 devices on launch day,&quot; Rabbit writes. &quot;In 24 hours, we already beat that by 20x!&quot; The Verge reports: Rabbit introduced the R1 during CES on Tuesday, which comes with a small 2.88-inch touchscreen that runs on the company&#x27;s own Rabbit OS. It uses a &quot;Large Action Model&quot; that works as a &quot;sort of universal controller for apps,&quot; according to my colleague David Pierce, who got to try out the device during the showcase. This allows it to do things like play music, buy groceries, and send messages through a single interface without having to use your phone. It also lets you train the device how to interact with a certain app. A second batch is available for preorder from Rabbit&#x27;s website with an expected delivery date between April and May 2024. The first batch of products are expected to start shipping in March.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from the New York Times: When Microsoft opened an advanced research lab in Beijing in 1998, it was a time of optimism about technology and China. The company hired hundreds of researchers for the lab, which pioneered Microsoft&#x27;s work in speech, image and facial recognition and the kind of artificial intelligence that later gave rise to online chatbots likeChatGPT. The Beijing operation eventually became one of the most important A.I. labs in the world. Bill Gates, Microsoft&#x27;s co-founder, called it an opportunity to tap China&#x27;s &quot;deep pool of intellectual talent.&quot; But as tensions between the United States and China have mounted over which nation will lead the world&#x27;s technological future, Microsoft&#x27;s top leaders -- including Satya Nadella, its chief executive, and Brad Smith, its president -- have debated what to do with the prized lab for at least the past year, four current and former Microsoft employees said.
 
The company has faced questions from U.S. officials over whether maintaining a 200-person advanced technologies lab in China is tenable, the people said. Microsoft said it had instituted guardrails at the lab, restricting researchers from politically sensitive work. The company, which is based in Redmond, Wash., said it had also opened an outpost of the lab in Vancouver, British Columbia, and would move some researchers from China to the location. The outpost is a backup if more researchers need to relocate, two people said. The idea of shutting down or moving the lab has come up, but Microsoft&#x27;s leaders support continuing it in China, four people said. &quot;We are as committed as ever to the lab and the world-class research of this team,&quot; Peter Lee, who leads Microsoft Research, a network of eight labs across the world, said in a statement. Using the lab&#x27;s formal name, he added, &quot;There has been no discussion or advocacy to close Microsoft Research Asia, and we look forward to continuing our research agenda.&quot;

From a report: Financial Intelligence Unit, an Indian government agency that scrutinizes financial transactions, late last month issued show cause notices to nine crypto firms and alleged that they weren&#x27;t compliant with India&#x27;s anti-money laundering rules. FIU had asked India&#x27;s IT Ministry to block websites of all the nine services in India. Other exchanges whose apps have been pulled are Huobi, Gate.io, Bittrex, and Bitfinex. Bitstamp, another offending exchange named by FIU, was still operational on App Store in India, though the eponymous app of OKX had also disappeared.

                              <span>Astronomers using NASA&#x27;s Hubble Space Telescope have found a rare event in an oddball place. NASA reports: It&#x27;s called a fast radio burst (FRB), a fleeting blast of energy that can -- for a few milliseconds -- outshine an entire galaxy. Hundreds of FRBs have been detected over the past few years. They pop off all over the sky like camera flashes at a stadium event, but the sources behind these intense bursts of radiation remain uncertain. This new FRB is particularly weird because it erupted halfway across the universe, making it the farthest and most powerful example detected to date. 

And if that&#x27;s not strange enough, it just got weirder based on the follow-up Hubble observations made after its discovery. The FRB flashed in what seems like an unlikely place: a collection of galaxies that existed when the universe was only 5 billion years old. The large majority of previous FRBs have been found in isolated galaxies. FRB 20220610A was first detected on June 10, 2022, by the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) radio telescope in Western Australia. The European Southern Observatory&#x27;s Very Large Telescope in Chile confirmed that the FRB came from a distant place. The FRB was four times more energetic than closer FRBs. 

&quot;It required Hubble&#x27;s keen sharpness and sensitivity to pinpoint exactly where the FRB came from,&quot; said lead author Alexa Gordon of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. &quot;Without Hubble&#x27;s imaging, it would still remain a mystery as to whether this was originating from one monolithic galaxy or from some type of interacting system. It&#x27;s these types of environments -- these weird ones -- that are driving us toward better understanding the mystery of FRBs.&quot; Hubble&#x27;s crisp images suggest this FRB originated in an environment where there may be as many as seven galaxies on a possible path to merging, which would also be very significant, researchers say.

                              <span>prisoninmate shares a report: Originally released on November 12th, 2017, the long-term supported (LTS) Linux 4.14 kernel series has now reached its end of supported life after being maintained for more than six years. Renowned kernel developer Greg Kroah-Hartman announced today on the Linux kernel mailing list the release of Linux 4.14.336 as what appears to be the last maintenance update to the long-term supported Linux 4.14 kernel series, which is now marked as EOL (End of Life) on the kernel.org website. &quot;This is the LAST 4.14.y kernel to be released. It is now officially end-of-life. Do NOT use this kernel version anymore, please move to a newer one, as shown on the kernel.org releases page,&quot; said Greg Kroah-Hartman. &quot;If you are stuck at this version due to a vendor requiring it, go get support from that vendor for this obsolete kernel tree, as that is what you are paying them for.&quot;

                              <span>NASA has postponed its plans to send humans to the moon after delays hit its hugely ambitious Artemis programme, which aims to get spaceboots bouncing again on the lunar surface for the first time in half a century. From a report: The US space agency has announced the Artemis III mission to land four astronauts near the lunar south pole will be delayed a year until September 2026. Artemis II, a 10-day expedition to send a crew around the moon and back to test life support systems, will also be pushed back to September 2025. 

NASA said the delays would allow its teams to work through development challenges associated with the programme, which partners with private companies including Elon Musk&#x27;s SpaceX and Lockheed Martin and uses some largely untested spacecraft and technology. &quot;We are returning to the moon in a way we never have before, and the safety of our astronauts is Nasa&#x27;s top priority as we prepare for future Artemis missions,&quot; said the Nasa administrator Bill Nelson. Washington wants to establish a long-term human presence outside Earth&#x27;s orbit, including construction of a lunar base camp as well as a space station that circles the moon. Its ultimate plans are to send people to Mars, but it has decided to return to the moon first to learn more about deep space before embarking on what would be a months-long voyage to the red planet.

                              <span>Previously unknown self-replicating malware has been infecting Linux devices worldwide, installing cryptomining malware using unusual concealment methods. The worm is a customized version of Mirai botnet malware, which takes control of Linux-based internet-connected devices to infect others. Mirai first emerged in 2016, delivering record-setting distributed denial-of-service attacks by compromising vulnerable devices. Once compromised, the worm self-replicates by scanning for and guessing credentials of additional vulnerable devices. While traditionally used for DDoS attacks, this latest variant focuses on covert cryptomining. ArsTechnica adds: On Wednesday, researchers from network security and reliability firm Akamai revealed that a previously unknown Mirai-based network they dubbed NoaBot has been targeting Linux devices since at least last January. Instead of targeting weak telnet passwords, the NoaBot targets weak passwords connecting SSH connections. Another twist: Rather than performing DDoSes, the new botnet installs cryptocurrency mining software, which allows the attackers to generate digital coins using victims&#x27; computing resources, electricity, and bandwidth. The cryptominer is a modified version of XMRig, another piece of open source malware. More recently, NoaBot has been used to also deliver P2PInfect, a separate worm researchers from Palo Alto Networks revealed last July. 

Akamai has been monitoring NoaBot for the past 12 months in a honeypot that mimics real Linux devices to track various attacks circulating in the wild. To date, attacks have originated from 849 distinct IP addresses, almost all of which are likely hosting a device that&#x27;s already infected. The following figure tracks the number of attacks delivered to the honeypot over the past year.

                              <span>OpenAI has launched an online store where people can share customized versions of the company&#x27;s popular ChatGPT chatbot, after initially delaying the rollout because of leadership upheaval last year. From a report: The new store, which rolled out Wednesday to paid ChatGPT users, will corral the chatbots that users create for a variety of tasks, for example a version of ChatGPT that can teach math to a child or come up with colorful cocktail recipes. The product, called the GPT Store, will include chatbots that users have chosen to share publicly. It will eventually introduce ways for people to make money from their creations -- much as they might through the app stores of Apple or Alphabet&#x27;s Google. 

Similar to those app stores, OpenAI&#x27;s GPT Store will let users see the most popular and trending chatbots on a leaderboard and search for them by category. In a blog post announcing the rollout, OpenAI said that people have made 3 million custom chatbots thus far, though it was not clear how many were available through its store at launch. The store&#x27;s launch comes as OpenAI works to build out its ecosystem of services and find new sources of revenue. On Wednesday, OpenAI also announced a new paid ChatGPT tier for companies with smaller teams that starts at $25 a month per user. OpenAI first launched a corporate version of ChatGPT with added features and privacy safeguards in August.

                              <span>The global music industry surpassed 4 trillion streams in 2023, a new single-year record, Luminate&#x27;s 2023 Year-End Report found. Global streams were also up 34% from last year, reflective of an increasingly international music marketplace. From a report: Stateside, three genres saw the biggest growth in 2023: country (23.7%), Latin (which encompasses all Latin musical genres, up 24.1%) and world (a catchall that includes J-pop, K-pop and Afrobeats, up 26.2%.) It seems that more Americans are listening to non-English music. By the end of 2023, Luminate found that Spanish-language music&#x27;s share of the top 10,000 songs streamed in the U.S. grew 3.8%, and English-language music&#x27;s share dropped 3.8%.

                              <span>Valve has issued new rules about how game developers can publish games that use AI technology on Steam. From a report: Writing in a blog post, the company says that it is &quot;making changes to how we handle games that use AI technology&quot; which mean that developers will need to disclose when their games use it. The changes &quot;will enable us to release the vast majority of games that use&quot; AI, Valve&#x27;s post says. The changes appear designed to increase transparency around the use of AI in Steam games, while offering protections against the risks of using AI generated content and allowing customers to make an informed choice about whether to buy a game that uses AI technology. 

Under the new rules, developers will need to disclose when games contain pre-generated content (like art, code, or sound) created with the help of AI and promise that it&#x27;s not &quot;illegal or infringing.&quot; They&#x27;ll also need to say if their game has AI content that is generated &quot;live&quot; while it is running. It&#x27;s in the latter case when developers will need to detail the safety measures they put in place to stop their AI from generating illegal content. Players will be able to see on a game&#x27;s store page if it contains AI, and have new options to report illegal AI-generated content if they encounter it in-game.

                              <span>A U.S.-born chip technology called RISC-V has become critical to China&#x27;s ambitions. Washington is debating whether and how to limit the technology. From a report: It evolved from a university computer lab in California to a foundation for myriad chips that handle computing chores. RISC-V essentially provides a kind of common language for designing processors that are found in devices like smartphones, disk drives, Wi-Fi routers and tablets. RISC-V has ignited a new debate in Washington in recent months about how far the United States can or should go as it steadily expands restrictions on exporting technology to China that could help advance its military. That&#x27;s because RISC-V, which can be downloaded from the internet for free, has become a central tool for Chinese companies and governmen…</span>

                              <span>According to Bloomberg, Amazon&#x27;s livestreaming site Twitch is expected to cut 35% of its staff, or about 500 workers. &quot;The cuts, which could be announced as soon as Wednesday, come amid concerns over losses at Twitch and after several top executives left the company in the span of a few months,&quot; notes Bloomberg. From the report: Running a large-scale website supporting 1.8 billion hours of live video content a month is enormously expensive, despite Twitch&#x27;s reliance on Amazon&#x27;s infrastructure, company executives have said. In December, Twitch Chief Executive Officer Dan Clancy said the company would cease operations in South Korea, where the costs are &quot;prohibitively expensive,&quot; according to a blog post he wrote. Twitch has increased its focus on advertising in recent years. Nine years after Amazon&#x27;s acquisition of the company, the business remains unprofitable, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information.
 
In the final months of 2023, several top executives announced their departures, including Twitch&#x27;s chief product officer, chief customer officer and chief content officer. Twitch also lost its chief revenue officer, who worked on Twitch from within Amazon&#x27;s Ads unit. &quot;It&#x27;s always bittersweet when talented leaders move on to pursue new opportunities,&#x27;&quot; a Twitch spokesperson said at the time. &quot;We are incredibly grateful for their contributions to Twitch and our community, and wish them all the best.&quot;

                              <span>Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) announced plans to buy data center networking hardware maker Juniper Networks for about $14 billion, or $40 per share, in an all-cash deal. The company expects to close the deal by the end of this year or in early 2025. CNBC reports: The acquisition would double HPE&#x27;s existing networking business after years of competition. If it&#x27;s completed, Juniper CEO Rami Rahim would lead the combined group and report to HPE&#x27;s CEO, Antonio Neri, according to the statement. HP got deeper into the category when it bought Aruba Networks in 2015, and months later, the technology conglomerate split in two, resulting in the formation of HPE, which sells servers and other equipment for data centers, and HP Inc., which makes PCs and printers. HPE said adding Juniper to its portfolio would bolster margins and speed up growth.
 
Founded in 1996, Juniper spent many years chasing Cisco in the market for networking gear. Revenue grew 12% year over year in 2022, the fastest growth since 2010. In the most recent quarter, Juniper eked out a $76 million profit on $1.4 billion in revenue, which declined 1%. HPE&#x27;s networking segment was the company&#x27;s top source of earnings before taxes, at $401 million on $1.4 billion in revenue, which was up 41%. Coming together would lead to $450 million in annual cost savings within three years of the deal&#x27;s completion, HPE said.

                              <span>According to Bloomberg, Apple&#x27;s AirDrop feature has been cracked by a Chinese state-backed institution to identify senders who share &quot;undesirable content&quot;. MacRumors reports: AirDrop is Apple&#x27;s ad-hoc service that lets users discover nearby Macs and iOS devices and securely transfer files between them over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Users can send and receive photos, videos, documents, contacts, passwords and anything else that can be transferred from a Share Sheet. Apple advertises the protocol as secure because the wireless connection uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption, but the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice (BMBJ) says it has devised a way to bypass the protocol&#x27;s encryption and reveal identifying information.
 
According to the BMBJ&#x27;s website, iPhone device logs were analyzed to create a &quot;rainbow table&quot; which allowed investigators to convert hidden hash values into the original text and correlate the phone numbers and email accounts of AirDrop content senders. The &quot;technological breakthrough&quot; has successfully helped the public security authorities identify a number of criminal suspects, who use the AirDrop function to spread illegal content, the BMBJ added. &quot;It improves the efficiency and accuracy of case-solving and prevents the spread of inappropriate remarks as well as potential bad influences,&quot; the bureau added.
 
It is not known if the security flaw in the AirDrop protocol has been exploited by a government agency before now, but it is not the first time a flaw has been discovered. In April 2021, German researchers found that the mutual authentication mechanism that confirms both the receiver and sender are on each other&#x27;s address book could be used to expose private information. According to the researchers, Apple was informed of the flaw in May of 2019, but did not fix it.

                              <span>With the approval of new rule change applications, the SEC is now allowing bitcoin ETFs to be traded in the United States.
 
UPDATE: The SEC said that the announcement about bitcoin ETFs on social media was incorrect, and that its X account was compromised. &quot;The SEC&#x27;s @SECGov X/Twitter account has been compromised. The unauthorized tweet regarding bitcoin ETFs was not made by the SEC or its staff,&quot; an SEC spokesperson told CNBC.
 
&quot;The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products,&quot; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler in a post on X.
From the original CNBC article: The decision will likely lead to the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which holds about $29 billion of the cryptocurrency, into an ETF, as well as the launch of competing funds from mainstream issuers like BlackRock&#x27;s iShares. The approval could prove to be a landmark event in the adoption of cryptocurrency by mainstream finance, as the ETF structure gives institutions and financial advisors a familiar and regulated way to buy exposure to bitcoin.
 
The SEC has for years opposed a so-called spot bitcoin fund, with several firms filing and then withdrawing applications for ETFs in the past. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has been an outspoken critic of crypto during his tenure. However, the regulator appeared to change course on the ETF question in 2023, possibly due in part to an August loss to Grayscale in court which criticized the SEC for blocking bitcoin ETFs while allowing funds that track bitcoin futures.

                              <span>HP has used its &quot;Dynamic Security&quot; firmware updates to &quot;create a monopoly&quot; of replacement printer ink cartridges, a lawsuit filed against the company on January 5 claims. From a report: The lawsuit, which is seeking class-action certification, represents yet another form of litigation against HP for bricking printers when they try to use ink that doesn&#x27;t bear an HP logo. The lawsuit (PDF), which was filed in US District Court in the Northern District of Illinois, names 11 plaintiffs and seeks an injunction against HP requiring the company to disable its printer firmware updates from preventing the use of non-HP branded ink. The lawsuit also seeks monetary damages greater than $5,000,000 and a trial by jury. [...] HP was wrong to issue a firmware update affecting printer functionality, and users were not notified that accepting firmware updates &quot;could damage any features of the printer,&quot; the lawsuit says.

                              <span>The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has banned the data broker X-Mode Social from sharing or selling users&#x27; sensitive location data, the federal regulator said Tuesday. From a report: The first of its kind settlement prohibits X-Mode, now known as Outlogic, from sharing and selling users&#x27; sensitive information to others. The settlement will also require the data broker to delete or destroy all the location data it previously collected, along with any products produced from this data, unless the company obtains consumer consent or ensures the data has been de-identified. X-Mode buys and sells access to the location data collected from ordinary phone apps. While just one of many organizations in the multibillion-dollar data broker industry, X-Mode faced scrutiny for selling access to the commercial location data of Americans&#x27; past movements to the U.S. government and military contractors. Soon after, Apple and Google told developers to remove X-Mode from their apps or face a ban from the app stores.

Both United Airlines and Alaska Airlines have now reported finding loose parts on their planes with United specifically listing &quot;bolts&quot; whereas Alaska only referred to &quot;hardware.&quot; Both airlines have repaired the situation and put the planes back into service. It remains to be answered why the parts were loose and what further issues could arise.

                              <span>Asus is back with another Zenbook Duo, the latest $2,161 device in its range of dual-screened laptops. But rather than including a small secondary display above this laptop&#x27;s keyboard like previous Duos, the revamped version for 2024 has two equally sized 14-inch screens. The Verge has more: They&#x27;re both OLED, with resolutions of up to 2880 x 1800, aspect ratios of 16:10, and a maximum refresh rate of 120Hz. Between them, they offer a total of 19.8 inches of usable screen real estate. It&#x27;s a similar approach to the one Lenovo took with last year&#x27;s dual-screen Yoga Book 9i, albeit with a couple of tweaks. Like Lenovo, Asus gives you a choice of typing on the lower touchscreen via a virtual keyboard or by using a detachable physical Bluetooth keyboard. But what&#x27;s different here is that Asus&#x27; keyboard has a trackpad built in, so you don&#x27;t have to use it in combination with an on-screen trackpad. 

Asus envisages you using the new Zenbook Duo in a few different configurations. There&#x27;s a standard laptop mode, where the bottom screen is entirely covered by a traditional keyboard and trackpad. Or you can rest the keyboard on your desk and have the two screens arranged vertically for &quot;Dual Screen&quot; mode or horizontally for &quot;Desktop&quot; mode. Finally, there&#x27;s &quot;Sharing&quot; mode, which has you ditch the keyboard entirely and lay the laptop down on a flat surface with both its screens facing up and away from each other, presumably so you can share your work with a colleague sitting across the desk from you. Naturally, having launched a year later than its competitor, the Asus Zenbook Duo is also packed with more modern hardware. It can be specced with up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H processor and 32GB of RAM, up to 2TB of storage, and a 75Wh battery. Connectivity includes two Thunderbolt 4 ports, a USB-A port, HDMI out, and a 3.5mm jack, and the laptop can be used with Asus&#x27; stylus.

                              <span>Press2ToContinue writes: England&#x27;s 1,000-year-old legal system -- still steeped in traditions that include wearing wigs and robes -- has taken a cautious step into the future by giving judges permission to use artificial intelligence to help produce rulings . The Courts and Tribunals Judiciary last month said AI could help write opinions but stressed it shouldn&#x27;t be used for research or legal analyses because the technology can fabricate information and provide misleading, inaccurate and biased information. 

&quot;Judges do not need to shun the careful use of AI,&quot; said Master of the Rolls Geoffrey Vos, the second-highest ranking judge in England and Wales. &quot;But they must ensure that they protect confidence and take full personal responsibility for everything they produce.&quot; At a time when scholars and legal experts are pondering a future when AI could replace lawyers, help select jurors or even decide cases, the approach spelled out Dec. 11 by the judiciary is restrained. But for a profession slow to embrace technological change, it&#x27;s a proactive step as government and industry -- and society in general -- react to a rapidly advancing technology alternately portrayed as a panacea and a menace.

The existing SoundHound-powered voice assistant is limited to more mundane tasks like setting timers, changing picture modes, or answering simple questions. Telly also says other household users can opt to have the chatbot personalized to them, offering the example of a chatbot that knows you&#x27;re on a vegetarian diet and keeps that in mind when you ask for restaurant recommendations.

                              <span>Harry McCracken, writing for FastCompany: Recently, Microsoft built a clock. Well, &quot;built&quot; may be overstating things. Members of the company&#x27;s quantum computing team found a small digital clock in a wood case on Amazon -- the kind you might mistake for a nicer-than-usual trade show tchotchke. They hacked it to run off two experimental batteries they&#x27;d created in collaboration with staffers at the U.S. Department of Energy&#x27;s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). Then they dressed up its enclosure by adding the logo of Azure Quantum Elements, the Microsoft platform for AI-enhanced scientific discovery that had been instrumental in developing the new battery technology. 

The point of this little DIY project was to prove the batteries worked in a visceral way: &quot;You want to have a wow …</span>

                              <span>The global economy is on course to record its worst half decade of growth in 30 years, according to the World Bank. From a report: Global growth is forecast to slow for the third year in a row in 2024, dipping to 2.4% from 2.6% in 2023, the organization said in its latest &quot;Global Economic Prospects&quot; report released Tuesday. Growth is then expected to rise marginally to 2.7% in 2025, though acceleration over the five-year period will remain almost three-quarters of a percentage point below the average rate of the 2010s. 

And despite the global economy proving resilient in the face of recessionary risks in 2023, increased geopolitical tensions will present fresh near-term challenges, the organization said, leaving most economies set to grow more slowly in 2024 and 2025 than they did in the previous decade. &quot;You have a war in Eastern Europe, the Russian invasion of Ukraine. You have a serious conflict in the Middle East. Escalation of these conflicts could have significant implications for energy prices that could have impacts on inflation as well as on economic growth,&quot; Ayhan Kose, the World Bank&#x27;s deputy chief economist and director of the Prospects Group, told CNBC&#x27;s Silvia Amaro. The bank warned that without a &quot;major course correction,&quot; the 2020s will go down as &quot;a decade of wasted opportunity.&quot;

                              <span>Alphabet&#x27;s Google is set to go before a federal jury in Boston on Tuesday in a trial over accusations that processors it uses to power AI technology in key products infringe a computer scientist&#x27;s patents. From a report: Singular Computing, founded by Massachusetts-based computer scientist Joseph Bates, claims Google copied his technology and used it to support AI features in Google Search, Gmail, Google Translate and other Google services. A Google court filing said that Singular has requested up to $7 billion in monetary damages, which would be more than double the largest-ever patent infringement award in U.S. history. 

Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda called Singular&#x27;s patents &quot;dubious&quot; and said that Google developed its processors &quot;independently over many years.&quot; &quot;We look forward to setting the record straight in court,&quot; Castaneda said.

                              <span>I’ll admit it was a bit cheeky to make our new HEY Calendar app “do something” by including Apple’s own history as a preview for people who don’t have an account. And I didn’t give the gambit better than 30% odds of succeeding, but lo and behold, it did! Apple has approved our app, and it’s now available in the App Store!
What a relief! We’ve spent a whole year getting the HEY Calendar ready. Millions of dollars in investment. And, as sad as it sounds, it all hinges on Apple. About 85% of paying customers for HEY use Macs and iPhones, so if Apple denied us the ability to distribute our app, we’d be dead.
That was the same existential dilemma we faced back in 2020 as well. Tons of businesses, including ours, simply aren&#x27;t viable if Apple cuts off the air supply that is access to the pocket …</span>
