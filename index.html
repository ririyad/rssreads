This 650-attendee conference will kick off the worldwide ambitions for The Rails Foundation to host a new series of ecosystem gatherings at incredibly affordable prices (this first effort will be just €199-€299 for a ticket!). Way to make an entrance!
This new conference will kick off at quite a momentous occasion, too: Celebrating the 20th anniversary of Ruby on Rails! I started working on the framework in the summer of 2003 as part of the development of Basecamp. By October, the framework had a shape that would be completely recognizable today, with Active Record and Action Pack in place.

I vaguely remember doing a tour of our Chicago data center over a decade ago, but somewhere along the line, I just lost interest in the iron itself. Now the interest is back, because hardware is fun again, so let me share my excitement with you!
  
      
        

  
These are the two pallets that showed up in our Chicago data center recently. The same day that an identical set arrived in Ashburn, Virginia for our second data center. In total, we received twenty R7625 Dell servers that&#x27;ll power the bulk of our cloud exit. It&#x27;s a staggering amount of computing power in a shockingly small footprint.
Here&#x27;s a diagram of our four cabinets in Chicago (we have another four in Ashburn). As …</span>

                              <span>We are excited to welcome Arlo Siemsen and Scott Schafer as new members to the Cargo Team!
Arlo has been instrumental in bringing Cargo&#x27;s new sparse registry support to fruition, which significantly improves registry performance. He has been involved with registry design and authentication discussions, and has been closely working with the team over the past year.
Scott has been very active in the past year, working on various parts of Cargo, namely implementing workspace inheritance. Since then, he has been helping with maintenance and designing new features.
With their help we now have capacity to start thinking about how feature development should be done moving forward. We are still in early discussions of processes for matching feature development with reviewer capacity, and will share more in the future. Thanks to Arlo and Scott for their help, and we are very much looking forward to having them as a part of the team!</span>

                              <span>Tim Urban&#x27;s new book What&#x27;s Our Problem? offers an excellent analysis of the current American political malaise. It breaks down the history of first how the Republican party got overrun by low-rung thinking from the mid-90s forward, then how equally low-rung thinking got the other side in the past decade or so. It&#x27;s a light, humorous recap of modern American political history. I highly recommend it.
It&#x27;s central contribution is adding a second dimension to the political spectrum. What we&#x27;re dealing with is not just far-left, left, center, right, far-right. That spectrum is about contesting &quot;what is&quot; and &quot;what ought to be&quot;. Our current problem is not so much disagreeing about those two central elements. All democracies will and should continue to do that. It&#x27;s how that disagreements manifes…</span>

                              <span>The product development process encompasses many moments. Moments of novel breakthrough, moments of mundane maintenance, and everything in between. But some of the most rewarding moments consistently come from making something simply useful.
Yesterday we shipped a feature in HEY called &quot;Reply to Everyone&quot; that was exactly that: Simply useful.
One of the things that makes something simply useful is a clear line from problem to solution. From hassle to effortlessness. From a lot of time to nearly no time at all. From creating work to eliminating work.
So let&#x27;s trace Reply to Everyone back to the initial germ of the idea.
It all started with frustration. This is a great place to start any feature. In fact, the closer you start to frustration, the more fuel you have to burn up the problem.

                              <span>Recent discussions with my colleagues showed that many software teams
     still run into trouble because they pack too much planned
     work into their iterations. Teams will usually run better when they have
     deliberate Slack, as it allows their delivery to be more predictable and
     gives them time to improve their environment.
While writing that bliki post, I also defined two styles of task
     planning in agile projects. Timeboxed Iterations are used to
     break up work into small chunks with a regular cadence to reassess the work
     and future plans. Using a little ceremony around allocating work to
     iterations helps make problems visible so that they can be dealt with
     properly. Continuous Flow
     dispenses with that ceremony, so skilled teams often prefer it.

He&#x27;s sharing the story of JSON, his discovery of JavaScript&#x27;s good parts, and his approach to finding a simple way to build software. Also, his battles against XML, against complexity, his battles to say that there&#x27;s a better way to build software.

                              <span>One of the most important techniques I&#x27;ve embraced for managing my time is to direct related tasks to a bucket, let that bucket accumulate until full, then empty it all in one go. This in contrast to trying to catch every task the moment it lands from the myriad of interruption pipes that&#x27;ll drip-drip-drip your day away if you let them. Nowhere is the most evident than with email.
I used to take such pride in inbox zero when I was still using Gmail. I&#x27;d check email continuously throughout the day, and I&#x27;d get back to almost everyone immediately. Whether it was urgent or not. Just so I could see that sweet zero. It felt very productive. It was not.
Every email is a drop, and every drop ripples the surface of your mind. It&#x27;s careless to let them hit without a filter. Your attention will have…</span>

Whether on guns or healthcare or taxes or any other major policy position that&#x27;s so fiercely contested in the US. Despite growing up in this little Nordic country, I didn&#x27;t fully appreciate the tremendous, underpinning power of a homogenous culture to fasten all these planks of a socially-democratic state – until I returned after 15 years Over There. I do now.
Denmark is a notoriously difficult country to integrate in. Not only because the language difficult, but because the people are too! I say this with all the love and respect of a Dane that continues to marvel at what a high-trust, high-coherence society these former Vikings have managed to construct. But it&#x27;s true.

                              <span>Last week I was talking with another business owner from a different industry. He was frustrated with an employee who kept asking him what to do if x, y, or z happens. This was a long-time employee who&#x27;d been in these situations before, not someone new who was learning the ropes.
With this particular employee, it&#x27;s always the same set of questions no matter the situation. It could be a call with a client. If could be a meeting with another department. It could be a conversation with a vendor. What if they bring this up...? What if they bring that up...? What should I say if they say...? What about if they...? Essentially this employee wanted to be prepared for every contingency in a given situation. And they were great when everything went as anticipated.
Being prepared sounds like a good …</span>

Musk has announced they&#x27;ll start reserving presence in the For You tab solely for paying customers from April 15th, limit participation in polls to just those customers, and soon also give preferential showing in replies as well. Legacy blue-checks will not be spared, and will in fact lose their old privileges. The price is the same for all. Bold!
All of the usual characters from the Musk Sucks Show are up in arms about this, of course. Something about how charging money for a service is a transgression against Musk&#x27;s allegiance to free speech, I think?

                              <span>The Rust team has published a new point release of Rust, 1.68.2. Rust is a
programming language that is empowering everyone to build reliable and
efficient software.
If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, you can get 1.68.2 with:
rustup update stable

If you don&#x27;t have it already, you can get rustup
from the appropriate page on our website, and check out the
detailed release notes for 1.68.2 on GitHub.
What&#x27;s in 1.68.2 stable
Rust 1.68.2 addresses GitHub&#x27;s recent rotation of their RSA SSH host
key, which
happened on March 24th 2023 after their previous key accidentally leaked:
GitHub&#x27;s RSA key bundled in Cargo has been
updated, to ensure systems
that haven&#x27;t interacted with GitHub yet won&#x27;t connect trusting the leaked
key.
The leaked key has been hardcoded as revoked in
Cargo, to ensure the key
won&#x27;t be used by Cargo even on systems that still trust the key.
Support for @revoked entries in
.ssh/known_hosts (along with
a better error message when the unsupported @cert-authority entries are used)
is also included in Rust 1.68.2, as that change was a pre-requisite for
backporting the hardcoded revocation.
If you cannot upgrade to Rust 1.68.2, we recommend following GitHub&#x27;s
instructions
on updating the trusted keys in your system. Note that the keys bundled in
Cargo are only used if no trusted key for github.com is found on the system.
Contributors to 1.68.2
Many people came together to create Rust 1.68.2. We couldn&#x27;t have done it
without all of you. Thanks!</span>

                              <span>Every week seems to offer fresh staff cuts at the big tech companies right now. Several of the giants are already on their second rounds, and few would probably bet against a third after those. But as hard as it is on an individual level – and it&#x27;s always hard! – there&#x27;s a silver lining for the economy as a whole: Releasing captive talent.
See, the big tech companies gobbled up so much talent at such high salaries during the pandemic that it scarcely left any for the rest of the economy. So many companies outside of big tech were priced out of the competition for key tech hires. That just can&#x27;t be good for the economy in the long run. We need smart people focused on other problems beyond figuring out how to make people click more ads.
But while the mammoth cuts at Facebook, Amazon, and els…</span>

                              <span>The Rust team has published a new point release of Rust, 1.68.1. Rust is a
programming language that is empowering everyone to build reliable and
efficient software.
If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, you can get 1.68.1 with:
rustup update stable

If you don&#x27;t have it already, you can get rustup
from the appropriate page on our website, and check out the
detailed release notes for 1.68.1 on GitHub.
What&#x27;s in 1.68.1 stable
Rust 1.68.1 stable primarily contains a change to how Rust&#x27;s CI builds the
Windows MSVC compiler, no longer enabling LTO for the Rust code. This led to a
miscompilation that the Rust
team is debugging, but in the meantime we&#x27;re reverting the change to enable
LTO.
This is currently believed to have no effect on wider usage of ThinLTO. The
Rust compiler used an unstable flag as part of the build process to enable
ThinLTO despite compiling to a dylib.
There are a few other regression fixes included in the release:
Fix building the compiler with --enable-local-rust
Treat $prefix-clang as clang in linker detection code
Fix a panic in the compiler
Contributors to 1.68.1
Many people came together to create Rust 1.68.1. We couldn&#x27;t have done it
without all of you. Thanks!</span>

                              <span>The majority of customers will never tell you why they stop buying on their own. In fact, even if pressed, most will just smile, nod, and give you some face-saving reason for how “now is just not the right time” or “we are just going in a different direction”. Because that’s what avoids conflict.


Thus, the only time you’re truly allowed a free peek at the naked truth of why your product or service didn’t fit, is when the customer is really upset. That’s when they might air out their frustration.


This is a test. 


You can either protect your ego from the sharp words of a frustrated customer by dismissing the feedback entirely OR you can be smart enough to filter out the emotion while retaining the crucial information that’ll improve your offering. Every loud, angry customer represents at least a dozen silent ones you lost to the same issues.


But it’s hard! We bond with our creations and our companies because that’s the human thing to do if you like your work. So those sharp words can and often do hurt your feelings. It’s only natural to want to parry and riposte.  


Before you do, though, remember the coin. If the customer takes the side that says “this is the end of the world”, you have to train yourself not to instinctively reach for “it’s no big deal / you’re overreacting / everyone else is fine with it”. If you do, you’ll gain nothing, and you’ll learn nothing.


So embrace the conflict of an angry customer as a rare gift of feedback. Remove your ego from the response. Extract the maximum amount of information to feed back into the offering.


That’s how you win. By building better rather than defending worse.</span>

                              <span>At most companies, people put together a deck, reserve a room (physical or virtual), and call a meeting to pitch a new idea. If they&#x27;re lucky, no one interrupts them while they&#x27;re presenting. When it&#x27;s over, people react. This is precisely the problem.
The person making the pitch has presumably put a lot of time, thought, and energy into gathering their thoughts and presenting them clearly to an audience. But the rest of the people in the room are asked to react. Not absorb, not think it over, not consider — just react. Knee-jerk it. That&#x27;s no way to treat fragile, new ideas.
At 37signals we flip the script.
When we present work, it&#x27;s almost always written up first. In long form. A few hundred words, maybe a thousand. A complete idea in the form of a carefully composed document. Complete w…</span>

The problem was that our entire marketing budget for 2023 amounted to a &quot;mere&quot; five million dollars. That&#x27;s a huge multiple of everything we&#x27;ve ever spent before on marketing in the entire 24-year history of the company, but a pittance when you work with a top-tier agency full of people who used to do campaigns for the like of Apple or Nike.
Of course this is all on us. While the agency knew what our budget was going in, we should have known that working with people who&#x27;d done work with the biggest, richest corporations in the worl…</span>

documenting client libraries, writing sample code for client
libraries, and writing integration tests against the sample code.
The client library documentation is generated with a Zig script. The
sample code is integration tested with a Zig script. A bunch of Zig
scripts.
It&#x27;s not the same
rigorous
sort of Zig as the main database. (We&#x27;re generally more lax about
scripts and test code.)
And I&#x27;m specifically writing this post on my personal blog since my
script code is not under incredible scrutiny.
Furthermore, I&#x27;m still new to Zig. Since I&#x27;m still learning, there
have been a few things that tripped me up.
And now that I&#x27;ve written this out, I realize most of my stumbling was
related to errors.

                              <span>We recently received this email from a REWORK Podcast listener who had a question...

...I think it was in Shape Up that the idea of delegating projects rather than tasks came up. And I&#x27;m trying to move this way, of working with my own team. I just wonder if you guys have any tips or help for making that transition, helping team members take ownership for their areas of work, maybe obstacles I can watch out for leading my team in this way as we move in this direction. We have a small team, just a handful of people. But I would love to move in this direction where they&#x27;re taking more ownership and I can delegate whole projects rather than, um, me kind of owning the project and then delegating tasks...

We&#x27;re likely going to address this question out loud on an upcoming podcast AMA, but I wa…</span>

                              <span>There&#x27;s a lot of talk right now about smaller, slimmer, tighter teams. Economics are forcing companies to cut back, and what they&#x27;re finding is progress. Trim the overgrown crown, let the sunshine meet the ground, and all sorts of new life blooms on the forest floor.
Even Zuck, master of a megacorp, is noticing it:

&quot;Since we reduced our workforce last year, one surprising result is that many things have gone faster... Indirect costs compound and it’s easy to underestimate them... A leaner org will execute its highest priorities faster&quot;

A number of years ago I wrote a piece lauding the number three. I meant every word. Three person teams are incredibly efficient.
But what&#x27;s better than three?
