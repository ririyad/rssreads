                              <span>According to Bloombeg&#x27;s Mark Gurman (paywalled), Apple is experimenting with a new 3D-printing manufacturing process for some device production, starting with the upcoming Apple Watch Series 9 models. MacRumors reports: The new manufacturing process that Apple is testing would use less material than the large slabs of metal that are needed for traditional CNC manufacturing, plus it would cut down on the time that it takes to make new devices. With a technique called &quot;binder jetting,&quot; Apple is able to print a device&#x27;s outline at close to its actual shape using a powdered substance. A second process uses heat and pressure to squeeze the material into a substance that feels like steel, and it is then refined with milling.
 
Gurman&#x27;s information echoes what we&#x27;ve already heard from Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Back in July, Kuo said that the upcoming second-generation Apple Watch Ultra will include 3D printed mechanical parts. Specifically, he claimed that Apple is &quot;actively adopting 3D printing technology,&quot; and that some of the titanium components in the new Apple Watch Ultra would be 3D printed. Gurman claims that Apple plans to use this new 3D printing method for the chassis of the stainless steel Apple Watch Series 9 models rather than components for the Ultra but either way, it sounds like Apple is more actively testing this manufacturing method as of 2023. Gurman says that Apple plans to 3D print titanium devices in 2024. The report notes that the shift to 3D printing would also &quot;allow Apple to improve manufacturing times and potentially cut down on costs.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from UploadVR: Magic Leap 1 AR headsets will &#x27;cease to function&#x27; from December 31, 2024, the company announced. Magic Leap 1 launched in mid 2018 as the first transparent AR headset marketed and sold to consumers. The headset is powered by a tethered waist-mounted compute pack and came with a single tracked controller, though it got hand tracking support too. Content for the device included avatar chat, a floating web browser, a Wayfair app for seeing how furniture might look in your room, two games made by Insomniac Games, and a Spotify background app.
 
But Magic Leap 1&#x27;s eye-watering $2300 price and the limitations of transparent optics (even today) meant it reportedly fell significantly short of sales expectations. Transparent AR currently provides a much smaller field of view than the opaque display systems of VR-style headsets, despite costing significantly more. And Magic Leap 1&#x27;s form factor wasn&#x27;t suitable for outdoor use, so it didn&#x27;t provide the out-of-home functionality AR glasses promise to one day like on-foot navigation, translation, and contextual information. The Information reported that Magic Leap&#x27;s founder, the CEO at the time, originally expected it to sell over one million units in the first year. In reality it reportedly sold just 6000 units in the first six months.

                              <span>According to a new report by The Wall Street Journal, mobile carriers including Verizon, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile are all requiring customers to switch to a debit card or bank account withdrawal in order to receive an autopay discount on their plan. Verizon has included this requirement for years, but in the past few months the other two carriers have quietly added it too. The Verge reports: The new rule goes into effect for AT&amp;T customers on October 2nd, and as a gesture of goodwill, the company will only reduce your discount if you continue to pay with a credit card. Those who register for autopay with a bank or debit card will receive $10 off; a credit card will only get you $5. T-Mobile&#x27;s change went into effect in July, also eliminating Apple Pay and Google Pay as methods eligible for the $5 discount. Oh, and technically, you can qualify for Verizon&#x27;s autopay discount with a credit card -- it just has to be a Verizon Visa card.
 
AT&amp;T and T-Mobile aren&#x27;t just making this a requirement for new customers -- the change is being applied to all postpaid accounts. Even if you&#x27;ve been receiving the discount for years with a credit card, you&#x27;ll have to make the switch in order to keep your discount. And it adds up -- the discounts are applied for each line on your plan, so if your whole family is on the same plan, it&#x27;s a significant amount of money.

                              <span>UK&#x27;s Home Office is looking to increase its use of controversial facial recognition technologies to track and find criminals within policing and other security agencies. From a report: In a document released on Wednesday, the government outlined its ambitions to potentially deploy new biometric systems nationally over the next 12 to 18 months. The move comes after privacy campaigners and independent academics criticised the technology for being inaccurate and biased, particularly against darker-skinned people. 

MPs have previously called for a moratorium on its use on the general population until clear laws are established by parliament. The government is calling for submissions from companies for technologies that &quot;can resolve identity using facial features and landmarks,&quot; including for live facial recognition which involves screening the general public for specific individuals on police watch lists. 

In particular, the Home Office is highlighting its interest in novel artificial intelligence technologies that could process facial data efficiently to identify individuals, and software that could be integrated with existing technologies deployed by the department and with CCTV cameras. Facial recognition software has been used by South Wales Police and London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police over the past five years across multiple trials in public spaces including shopping centres, during events such as the Notting Hill Carnival and, more recently, during the coronation.

                              <span>To date, Google has processed more than seven billion copyright takedown requests for its search engine. The majority of the reported links are purged from Google&#x27;s search index, as required by the DMCA. Recently, however, Google appears to gone a step further, using search takedowns to &quot;moderate&quot; users&#x27; privately saved links collections. TorrentFreak: A few hours ago, Eddie Roosenmaallen shared an email from Google, notifying him that a link had been removed from his Google Saved collection because it violates Google&#x27;s policy. The reason cited for the removal is the &quot;downstream impact,&quot; as the URL in question is &quot;blocked by Google Search.&quot; 

&quot;The following saved item in one of your collections was determined to violate Google&#x27;s policy. As a result, the item will be moderated..,&quot; Google writes, pointing out a defunct KickassTorrents domain as the problem. Initially, it was suggested that this removal impacted Google&#x27;s synched Chrome bookmarks but further research reveals that&#x27;s not the case. Instead, the removals apply to Google&#x27;s saved feature. This Google service allows users to save and organize links, similar to what Pinterest does. These link collections can be private or shared with third parties.

                              <span>The US Copyright Office is opening a public comment period around AI and copyright issues beginning August 30th as the agency figures out how to approach the subject. From a report: As announced [PDF] in the Federal Register, the agency wants to answer three main questions: how AI models should use copyrighted data in training; whether AI-generated material can be copyrighted even without a human involved; and how copyright liability would work with AI. It also wants comments around AI possibly violating publicity rights but noted these are not technically copyright issues. The Copyright Office said if AI does mimic voices, likenesses, or art styles, it may impact state-mandated rules around publicity and unfair competition laws. Written comments are due on October 18th, and replies must be submitted to the Copyright Office by November 15th. 

The copyright status of AI training data and the output of generative AI tools has become a hot topic for politicians, artists, authors, and even civil rights groups, making it a potential testing ground for coming AI regulation. The Copyright Office says that &quot;over the past several years, the Office has begun to receive applications to register works containing AI-generated material.&quot; It may use the comments to inform how it decides to grant copyright in the future. The Copyright Office was involved in a lawsuit last year after it refused to grant Stephen Thaler rights to an image created by an AI platform. Earlier this month, a Washington, DC, court sided with the US Copyright Office in the case, stating copyright has never been handed to any work without a human involved.

                              <span>The stakes are high for Bethesda&#x27;s newest role-playing game. Microsoft needs an Xbox hit, and players are hungry for an expansive and satisfying space adventure. From a report: Starfield almost immediately nudges its players to the edges of the cosmos. In the opening hours of the role-playing video game, it&#x27;s possible to land your spaceship on Earth&#x27;s moon or zip 16 light-years to Alpha Centauri. When you open your map and zoom out from a planet, you can behold its surrounding solar system; zoom out again, and you&#x27;re scrolling past luminous stars and the mysterious worlds that orbit them. That sprawling celestial journey within Starfield, developed by Bethesda Game Studios, reveals both the tremendous potential and the monumental challenge of an open-world space adventure. Bethesda has hyped an expansive single-player campaign with 1,000 explorable planets. And expectations around the game, officially releasing on Sept. 6 after a 10-month delay, are nearly as vast. 

It&#x27;s the first new universe in 25 years for Bethesda, known for the Elder Scrolls and Fallout series. It&#x27;s also a high-stakes moment for Microsoft, which makes the Xbox and has long faced criticism that it produces fewer hit games than its console rivals, Sony and Nintendo. To compete, Microsoft went on a spending spree, acquiring Bethesda&#x27;s parent company in 2020 and agreeing to purchase Activision Blizzard in 2022, a $69 billion bet that is being challenged by regulators. Now Bethesda must deliver. Known for letting players navigate competing factions and undertake eccentric quests, the studio hopes Starfield will dazzle those clamoring for engaging encounters with alien life-forms or space mercenaries as well as a sense of boundless exploration.

                              <span>The latest version of the flagship FOSS browser is out, and it&#x27;s picked up one of the main features for which we keep Chrome around. From a report: The Firefox version 117 feature list might not look all that impressive, but it does have a big-ticket feature that may tempt people back: automatic translation. The snag is it&#x27;s disabled by default in the release version, and you&#x27;ll have to manually enable it. Although it was enabled in the betas, Mozilla has decided to go for a staged rollout and not enable it for everyone until Firefox 118 in six weeks or so. 

The new feature is integrated, privacy-respecting machine translation between multiple languages. This was already possible in older versions, but it needed an extension, and that had two side effects. One is that the extension hooked deep into the core of the browser in ways that Mozilla wasn&#x27;t comfortable about, and the other is that once your text had been sent out to a third-party website, it could be snooped upon -- but the victims of any snooping would blame the browser, even if it wasn&#x27;t the browser&#x27;s fault. To enable it, go to the configuration page (enter about:config in the address bar), and search for a setting called browser.translations.enable.

                              <span>Researchers say they have found fake apps in Google Play that masqueraded as legitimate ones for the Signal and Telegram messaging platforms. The malicious apps could pull messages or other sensitive information from legitimate accounts when users took certain actions. ArsTechnica: An app with the name Signal Plus Messenger was available on Play for nine months and had been downloaded from Play roughly 100 times before Google took it down last April after being tipped off by security firm ESET. It was also available in the Samsung app store and on signalplus[.]org, a dedicated website mimicking the official Signal.org. An app calling itself FlyGram, meanwhile, was created by the same threat actor and was available through the same three channels. Google removed it from Play in 2021. Both apps remain available in the Samsung store. 

Both apps were built on open source code available from Signal and Telegram. Interwoven into that code was an espionage tool tracked as BadBazaar. The Trojan has been linked to a China-aligned hacking group tracked as GREF. BadBazaar has been used previously to target Uyghurs and other Turkic ethnic minorities. The FlyGram malware was also shared in a Uyghur Telegram group, further aligning it to previous targeting by the BadBazaar malware family. Signal Plus could monitor sent and received messages and contacts if people connected their infected device to their legitimate Signal number, as is normal when someone first installs Signal on their device. Doing so caused the malicious app to send a host of private information to the attacker, including the device IMEI number, phone number, MAC address, operator details, location data, Wi-Fi information, emails for Google accounts, contact list, and a PIN used to transfer texts in the event one was set up by the user.

                              <span>The organization that represents the literary works of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard has filed a petition with the Federal Government, asking it to make it illegal to circumvent software locks for the repair of a highly specific set of electronic devices, according to a letter reviewed by 404 Media. From the report: The letter doesn&#x27;t refer to any single device, but experts say the petition covers Scientology&#x27;s &quot;E-Meter,&quot; a &quot;religious artifact&quot; and electronic that is core to Scientology. Author Services Inc., a group &quot;representing the literary, theatrical, and musical works of L. Ron Hubbard,&quot; told the U.S. Copyright Office that it opposes the renewal of an exemption to Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act that makes it legal for consumers to hack their personal electronics for the purposes of repair. 

This exemption to copyright law is needed because many electronics manufacturers put arbitrary software locks, Digital Rights Management systems, or other technological prevention measures that stop consumers from diagnosing or repairing devices unless they are authorized to do so. Special exemptions to copyright law make it legal for farmers to hack past John Deere&#x27;s DRM to fix their tractors, consumers to use software tools to help them repair certain parts of game consoles, or use third-party software to circumvent repair locks on printers, air conditioners, laptops, etc.

                              <span>VanMoof, the Dutch e-bike maker that gained a zealous following but declared bankruptcy last month, has been acquired by Lavoie, an upscale electric scooter company, the firms announced on Thursday. From a report: Riders of the expensive and technologically advanced VanMoof bikes were left in limbo by the company&#x27;s bankruptcy, because the machines are built from proprietary parts that only the company made and many of the bikes&#x27; functions are linked to a smartphone app that runs on the company&#x27;s servers. Despite the buzz around the brand, VanMoof had run into financial problems that led to a production backlog and monthslong waits for sales and repairs. 

But riders will not be completely out of limbo under the new ownership. &quot;What they can&#x27;t expect in the first couple of weeks is definitive answers to the problems,&quot; said Nick Fry, the chairman of McLaren Applied, the British motorsports technology company that owns Lavoie. The price of the acquisition was not disclosed, but Mr. Fry said Lavoie would spend &quot;tens of millions&quot; on the transaction as well as in investments over the coming months to &quot;rectify some of the challenges we face.&quot; He said, &quot;this is not going to be a walk in the park. This is going to be a challenge.&quot; One of the new owner&#x27;s priorities, he added, was improving the availability of parts and repairs, something that had become increasingly difficult for VanMoof owners. Regular bike shops could not -- or sometimes would not -- fix the bikes.

                              <span>A tiny island in the Caribbean is now sitting on a digital treasure. From a report: Anguilla, a tropical British territory, is known for its coral reefs and white sand beaches. Since the 1990s, however, it&#x27;s also been in charge of assigning internet addresses that end in .ai to residents and businesses looking to register websites. It was one of hundreds of country-specific domain names and easy to overlook -- until recently. Stability.ai, Elon Musk&#x27;s X.ai and Character.ai are just a few of the hot artificial intelligence startups that have snapped up the .ai domain assigned to the islands and cays that comprise Anguilla. Plenty of tech giants have their own web addresses ending in .ai as well: Google.ai and Facebook.ai route visitors to their company&#x27;s AI-focused webpages and Microsoft.ai shows off the company&#x27;s Azure AI services. 

The total number of registrations of sites ending with these two letters has effectively doubled in the past year to 287,432, according to Vince Cate, who for decades has managed the .ai domain for Anguilla. Cate estimates Anguilla will bring in as much as $30 million in domain-registration fees for 2023. Once one of the many obscure top-level domains assigned to countries and territories, .ai websites experienced a slow but steady increase in demand in recent years. But the sudden spike in .ai domains nine months ago highlights the broader frenzy around artificial intelligence and its ripple effects throughout the global economy. Since ChatGPT launched, a growing number of tech companies have raced to raise billions in capital, scoop up engineering talent and secure powerful but increasingly scarce chips. A domain may sound less essential, but for an industry obsessed with clever branding, the right name can be everything. &quot;Since November 30, things are very different here,&quot; Cate said, referring to the date when ChatGPT launched publicly.

                              <span>Activision has partnered with a company called Modulate to moderate voice chats using an AI technology called ToxMod. According to The Verge, the tool &quot;will work to identify behaviors like hate speech, discrimination, and harassment in real time.&quot; From the report: ToxMod&#x27;s initial beta rollout in North America begins today. It&#x27;s active within Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II and Call of Duty: Warzone. A &quot;full worldwide release&quot; (it does not include Asia, the press release notes) will follow on November 10th with the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, this year&#x27;s new entry in the franchise. Modulate&#x27;s press release doesn&#x27;t include too many details about how exactly ToxMod works. Its website notes that the tool &quot;triages voice chat to flag bad behavior, analyzes the nuances of each conversation to determine toxicity, and enables moderators to quickly respond to each incident by supplying relevant and accurate context.&quot;
 
The company&#x27;s CEO said in a recent interview that the tool aims to go beyond mere transcription; it takes factors like a player&#x27;s emotions and volume into context as well in order to differentiate harmful statements from playful ones. It is noteworthy that the tool (for now, at least) will not actually take action against players based on its data but will merely submit reports to Activision&#x27;s moderators.

The judgement against Mohammed bin Nasser al-Ghamdi, seen Wednesday by The Associated Press, comes against the backdrop of doctoral student Salma al-Shehab and others facing decades-long prison sentences over their comments online. The sentences appear part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman&#x27;s wider effort to stamp out any defiance in the kingdom as he pursues massive building projects and other diplomatic deals to raise his profile globally.

Nitpicking in pull requests reviews means offering insight that looks excessive, pedantic, and unimportant. It’s a pejorative term. I don’t question there are cases where the term applies, but many folks assimilate it to paying attention to the small stuff. By projecting all these negative connotations, this practice suddenly becomes undesirable: mind the big picture or leave the pull request alone. With that, we disagree. Small stuff when writing code matters, a lot.


Names matter
Naming things is a usual suspect when illustrating nitpicking. It’s also the example I have the hardest time swallowing. With the importance of names to make code understandable, how can anyone consider discussing those superfluous?

                              <span>Microsoft is discontinuing Visual Studio for Mac, committing to security updates and platform update compatibility for the next 12 months. 9to5Mac reports: &quot;With today&#x27;s announcement, we&#x27;re redirecting our resources and focus to enhance Visual Studio and VS Code, optimizing them for cross-platform development,&quot; the company said in the announcement.
&quot;No new framework, runtime, or language support will be added to Visual Studio for Mac.&quot; The company added: &quot;We will also continue to provide runtime and workload updates so you can continue building and shipping applications built on .NET 6, .NET 7, and the Mono frameworks. While not officially supported, we&#x27;ve also enabled rudimentary support for .NET 8 in Visual Studio for Mac for building and debugging applications.&quot;
 
Once the wheels fall off Visual Studio for Mac, Microsoft recommends accessing its IDE through Windows in a machine virtual on the Mac or in the cloud. Otherwise, Microsoft points to cross-platform compatible developer technology that will run on macOS: &quot;The recently announced C# Dev Kit, .NET MAUI, and Unity Extensions for VS Code are available in preview and are intended to augment VS Code&#x27;s capabilities for .NET and C# developers. These extensions operate natively across all supported platforms, including macOS, and the experience using these will continue to be improved as they move from preview to GA and beyond.&quot;

I knew what station they entered the subway at and at what specific time. They then entered another station a few hours later. If I had kept monitoring this person, I would have figured out the subway station they often start a journey at, which is near where they live. I would also know what specific time this person may go to the subway each day. During all this monitoring, I wasn&#x27;t anywhere near the rider. I didn&#x27;t even need to see them with my own eyes. Instead, I was sitting inside an apartment, following their movements through a feature on a Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) website, w…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from NPR: The Environmental Protection Agency removed federal protections for a majority of the country&#x27;s wetlands on Tuesday to comply with a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling. The EPA and Department of the Army announced a final rule amending the definition of protected &quot;waters of the United States&quot; in light of the decision in Sackett v. EPA in May, which narrowed the scope of the Clean Water Act and the agency&#x27;s power to regulate waterways and wetlands. A 2006 Supreme Court decision determined that wetlands would be protected if they had a &quot;significant nexus&quot; to major waterways. This year&#x27;s court decision undid that standard. The EPA&#x27;s new rule &quot;removes the significant nexus test from consideration when identifying tributaries and other waters as federally protected,&quot; the agency said.
 
In May, Justice Samuel Alito said the navigable U.S. waters regulated by the EPA under the Clean Water Act do not include many previously regulated wetlands. Writing the court&#x27;s decision, he said the law includes only streams, oceans, rivers and lakes, and wetlands with a &quot;continuous surface connection to those bodies.&quot; The EPA said the rule will take effect immediately. &quot;The agencies are issuing this amendment to the 2023 rule expeditiously -- three months after the Supreme Court decision -- to provide clarity and a path forward consistent with the ruling,&quot; the agency said. As a result of the rule change, protections for many waterways and wetlands will now fall to states.

                              <span>The Federal Communications Commission yesterday rejected requests to eliminate an upcoming requirement that Internet service providers list all of their monthly fees. From a report: Five major trade groups representing US broadband providers petitioned the FCC in January to scrap the requirement before it takes effect. In June, Comcast told the FCC that the listing-every-fee rule &quot;impose[s] significant administrative burdens and unnecessary complexity in complying with the broadband label requirements.&quot; The five trade groups kept up the pressure earlier this month in a meeting with FCC officials and in a filing that complained that listing every fee is too hard. The FCC refused to bend, announcing yesterday that the rules will take effect without any major changes. 

&quot;Every consumer needs transparent information when making decisions about what Internet service offering makes the most sense for their family or household. No one wants to be hit with charges they didn&#x27;t ask for or they did not expect,&quot; FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said. Yesterday&#x27;s order &quot;largely affirms the rules... while making some revisions and clarifications such as modifying provider record-keeping requirements when directing consumers to a label on an alternative sales channel and confirming that providers may state &#x27;taxes included&#x27; when their price already incorporates taxes,&quot; the FCC said.

                              <span>Hundreds of thousands of people are being forcibly engaged by organised criminal gangs into online criminality in Southeast Asia - from romance-investment scams and crypto fraud to illegal gambling - a report issued today by the UN Human Rights Office shows. From a report: Victims face a range of serious violations and abuses, including threats to their safety and security; and many have been subjected to torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, arbitrary detention, sexual violence, forced labour, and other human rights abuses, the report says. &quot;People who are coerced into working in these scamming operations endure inhumane treatment while being forced to carry out crimes. They are victims. They are not criminals,&quot; said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk. 

&quot;In continuing to call for justice for those who have been defrauded through online criminality, we must not forget that this complex phenomenon has two sets of victims.&quot; The enormity of online scam trafficking in Southeast Asia is difficult to estimate, the reports says, because of the clandestine nature and gaps in the official response. Credible sources indicate that at least 120,000 people across Myanmar may be held in situations where they are forced to carry out online scams, with estimates in Cambodia similarly at around 100,000. Other States in the region, including Lao PDR, the Philippines and Thailand, have also been identified as main countries of destination or transit where at least tens of thousands of people have been involved. The scam centres generate revenue amounting to billions of US dollars each year.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Microsoft employees were already expecting lackluster pay rises. In a company-wide email sent earlier this year, the tech company&#x27;s CEO Satya Nadella warned staff of salary freezes and cuts to the bonusbudget. But despite previous transparency around the cost-cutting measures, employees enquiring about how the budget cuts have impacted their performance review will now be fobbed off. According to leaked guidance, managers are being ordered to dodge such questions in the name of company culture. &quot;It&#x27;s natural for employees to ask questions about budget given the decisions shared in Satya&#x27;s email,&quot; the guidance reportedly states. &quot;However, it&#x27;s most important to focus discussions with direct reports on their impact for the past fiscal year and directly tie it to their rewards.&quot; 

Managers should not use the budget cuts as an &quot;explanation&quot; for compensation decisions for individual employees and instead should emphasize that the employee&#x27;s own &quot;impact&quot; determines &quot;rewards.&quot; &quot;Using budgets or factors besides the employee&#x27;s impact as an explanation for an employee&#x27;s rewards will erode trust and confidence within your team,&quot; the guide cautions. &quot;Reinforce that every year offers unique opportunity for impact, and we increase our high expectations, regardless of our budget.&quot;

                              <span>The word &quot;funga&quot; should be used alongside flora and fauna when discussing conservation issues to reflect the importance of fungi to ecosystem health, a UN body has said. From a report: The secretariat of the UN convention on biological diversity (UNCBD) said it was time that fungi were &quot;recognised and protected on an equal footing with animals and plants in legal conservation frameworks.&quot; 

&quot;Whenever referring to the macroscopic diversity of life on Earth, we should use &#x27;flora, fauna and funga,&#x27; and &#x27;animal, plants and fungi,&#x27;&quot; it said in an Instagram post. Mycologists, mostly from Latin America, established the term &quot;funga&quot; five years ago. It refers to the levels of diversity of fungi in any given place, and is analogous to &quot;flora and fauna,&quot; which refer to plants and animals. Unlike flora and fauna, it is not a Latin term but was chosen because it is morphologically similar. &quot;Just like mycelium, mycologically inclusive language will spread unseen but profound [sic], permeating public consciousness (and policy) to acknowledge fungi&#x27;s vital role in the grand web of life on and in Earth,&quot; it said.

                              <span>The European Union is stoking its power plants with fewer lumps of coal and barrels of oil and gas than it has ever recorded, data shows. From a report: The 27 member states burned 17% less fossil fuel to make electricity between January and June 2023 than over the same period the year before, a study from the clean energy thinktank Ember found. The EU made 410TWh of electricity from sources that release planet-heating gases, which analysts say is the lowest level since 2015 -- the first year for which they have monthly data -- and &quot;very likely&quot; since 2000. 

The drop in fossil fuel generation was driven by a fall in demand for electricity, as well as some growth in clean power, the study found. &quot;We&#x27;re glad to see fossil fuels down, but in the long-term it is not going to be sustainable to rely on the fall in demand to do this,&quot; said Matt Ewen, a data analyst at Ember and author of the report. &quot;We have to be replacing this energy rather than just expecting it to go away and not be used.&quot; To try to stop the planet heating, the EU has promised to cut greenhouse gas pollution by at least 55% from 1990 levels by the end of the decade, and hit net zero emissions by 2050. To get there, it will probably have to use less energy but more electricity than it does today, as more people heat homes and drive cars with electricity instead of fossil fuels.

                              <span>Amazon employees have been pushing back against the company&#x27;s return-to-office policy for months -- and it seems CEO Andy Jassy has had enough. From a report: During a pre-recorded internal Q&amp;A session earlier this month, Jassy told employees it was &quot;past the time to disagree and commit&quot; with the policy, which requires corporate employees to be in the office three days a week. The phrase &quot;disagree and commit&quot; is one of Amazon&#x27;s leadership principles, and was used often by the company&#x27;s founder and current executive chairman, Jeff Bezos. &quot;If you can&#x27;t disagree and commit, it&#x27;s probably not going to work out for you at Amazon,&quot; Jassy said, adding it wasn&#x27;t right for some employees to be in the office three days a week while others refuse to do so.

                              <span>A couple months after Microsoft revealed plans to increase Game Pass subscription prices, Sony is getting in on the act. From a report: The company is bumping up the annual prices of all three PlayStation Plus plans on September 6th. An annual Essential subscription will soon cost $80 per year, up from $60. The Extra plan is going up by $35 to $135 per year, while an annual Premium plan will soon cost $40 more at $160. The price changes won&#x27;t take effect for current PS Plus users on an annual plan until their next renewal date that&#x27;s on or after November 6th. If you make any changes to your plan between September 6th and then (such as changing tiers), the new pricing will apply. Sony has not announced changes to the monthly ($10 for Essential, $15 for Extra and $18 for Premium) or quarterly ($25 for Essential, $40 for Extra and $50 for Premium) for the time being. It notes that the annual plan is still less expensive than a monthly or quarterly subscription in the long run.

                              <span>An anonymous reader writes: I thought I had malware on my main Windows 11 machine this weekend. There I was minding my own business in Chrome before tabbing back to a game and wham a pop-up appeared asking me to switch my default search engine to Microsoft Bing in Chrome. Stunningly, Microsoft now thinks it&#x27;s ok to shove a pop-up in my face above my apps and games just because I dare to use Chrome instead of Microsoft Edge. This isn&#x27;t a normal notification, either. It didn&#x27;t appear in the notification center in Windows 11, nor is it connected to the part of Windows 11 that suggests new features to you. It&#x27;s quite literally a rogue executable file that has somehow appeared in c:\windows\temp\mubstemp and is digitally signed by Microsoft. 

&quot;We are aware of these reports and have paused this notification while we investigate and take appropriate action to address this unintended behavior,&quot; says Caitlin Roulston, director of communications, in a statement to The Verge. [...] This isn&#x27;t Microsoft&#x27;s first rodeo, either. I&#x27;m growing increasingly frustrated by the company&#x27;s methods of getting people to switch from Google and Chrome to Bing and Edge. Microsoft has been using a variety of prompts for years now, with pop-ups appearing inside Chrome, on the Windows taskbar, and elsewhere. Microsoft has even forced people into Edge after a Windows Update, and regularly presents a full-screen message to switch to Bing and Edge after updates.

                              <span>Replacing a sort algorithm in the FreeBSD kernel has improved its boot speed by a factor of 100 or more... and although it&#x27;s aimed at a micro-VM, the gains should benefit everyone. From a report: MicroVMs are a hot area of technology R&amp;D in the last half decade or so. The core idea is a re-invention of some of concepts and technology that IBM invented along with the hypervisor in the 1960s: designing OSes specifically to run as guests under another OS. This means building the OS specifically to run inside a VM, and to talk to resources provided by a specific hypervisor rather than to fake hardware. 

This means that the guest OS needs next to no support for real hardware, just VirtIO drivers which talk directly to facilities provided by the host hypervisor. In turn, the hypervisor doesn&#x27;t have to provide an emulated PCI bus, emulated power management, emulated graphics card, emulated network interface cards, and so on. The result is that the hypervisor itself can be much smaller and simpler. The result of ruthlessly chopping down both the hypervisor, and the OS that runs inside it, is that both ends can be much smaller and simpler. That means that VMs can use much fewer resources, and start up much quicker.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: A neurosurgeon in Australia pulled a wriggling 3-inch roundworm from the brain of a 64-year-old woman last year -- which was quite the surprise to the woman&#x27;s team of doctors and infectious disease experts, who had spent over a year trying to identify the cause of her recurring and varied symptoms. A close study of the extracted worm made clear why the diagnosis was so hard to pin down: the roundworm was one known to infect snakes -- specifically carpet pythons endemic to the area where the woman lived -- as well as the pythons&#x27; mammalian prey. The woman is thought to be the first reported human to ever have an infection with this snake-adapted worm, and it is the first time the worm has been found burrowing through a mammalian brain. …</span>

                              <span>According to TechCrunch, unnamed hackers reportedly breached the spyware firm WebDetetive, deleting device information to protect surveillance victims and denying spyware users new data. Engadget reports: Users of the spyware won&#x27;t get any new data from their targets. &quot;Because #fuckstalkerware,&quot; the hackers wrote in a note obtained by TechCrunch. The WebDetetive breach compromised more than 76,000 devices belonging to customers of the stalkerware, and more than 1.5 gigabytes of data freed from app&#x27;s servers, according to the hackers.
 
While TechCrunch did not independently confirm the deletion of victim&#x27;s data from the WebDetetive server, a cache of data shared by the hackers provided a look at what they were able to accomplish. TechCrunch also worked with a nonprofit that logs exposed datasets, DDoSecrets, to verify and analyze the information. Hackers obtained information on customers like IP addresses and devices that they targeted.

                              <span>According to DigiTimes, Apple will receive all TSMC&#x27;s first-generation 3-nanometer process chips this year for its upcoming devices. MacRumors reports: As early as May, Apple was known to have booked nearly 90% of the Taiwanese pure-play foundry for its upcoming next-gen devices. However, Apple is now projected to take 100% of TSMC&#x27;s capacity in 2023, due to delays in Intel&#x27;s wafer needs owing to later modifications to the company&#x27;s CPU platform design plans. Intel&#x27;s lack of orders means TSMC&#x27;s sales of 3nm chips will be significantly lower this year. While TSMC is still expected to experience significant growth in the fourth quarter as it starts mass producing 3nm chips for Apple&#x27;s needs, they too have been downgraded, according to DigiTimes&#x27; industry sources.
 
The report suggests TSMC&#x27;s 3nm process output may be reduced to 50,000-60,000 wafers monthly in the fourth quarter, down from the 80,000-100,000 units previously anticipated, due to a cutback in Apple&#x27;s orders. The current monthly output of TSMC&#x27;s 3nm process is estimated at approximately 65,000 wafers, the outlet&#x27;s sources said. Apple&#x27;s upcoming iPhone 15 Pro models are expected to feature the A17 Bionic processor, Apple&#x27;s first iPhone chip based on TSMC&#x27;s first-generation 3nm process, also known as N3B. The E3nm technology is said to deliver a 35% power efficiency improvement and 15% faster performance compared to 4nm, which was used to make the A16 Bionic chip for the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max.

One recent poll found that 65% of organizations feel they have &quot;too much&quot; data to analyze. Google&#x27;s proposed solution is BigQuery Studio, a new service within BigQuery, its fully managed serverless data warehouse, that provides a single experience to edit programming languages including SQL, Python and Spark to run analytics and machine learning workloads at &quot;petabyte scale.&quot; BigQuery Studio is available in preview as of this week.

As we begin the process, we wanted to spend some time explaining the goals and procedures we will follow.
We will summarize everything here, but if you would like to you can read the official process documentation.
We ask all project members to begin working with their Leadership Council representative to nominate potential Project Directors. See the Candidate Gathering section for more details. Nominations are due by September 15, 2023.
What are Project Directors?
The Rust Foundation Board of Directors has five seats reserved for Project Directors.
These Project Directors serve as representatives of the Rust project itself on the Board.

                              <span>ZDNet&#x27;s Steven Vaughan-Nichols shares what&#x27;s new in the release of Linux 6.5: The biggest news for servers -- and cloud Linux users -- is AMD Ryzen processors&#x27; P-State support. This support should mean better performance and power use across CPU cores. Intel Alder Lake CPUs have also received improved load balancing in a related development. RISC-V architecture fans will be pleased to find Linux now has Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) support. ACPI is used in Linux and other operating systems for power management. It&#x27;s vital for laptops and other battery-powered systems.
 
For better security, people using virtual machines or sandboxes based on Usermode Linux for testing, or running multiple versions of Linux at once, now have Landlock support. Landock is a Linux Security Module that enables applications to sandbox themselves by selecting access rights to directories. It&#x27;s designed to be used by unprivileged processes while following the system security policy. To make talking with the rest of the world easier, Linux 6.5 now supports USB 4v2. This new USB-C standard will support up to an eye-watering 120Gbps. And while we&#x27;re still getting used to Wi-Fi 6E, the Wi-Fi Alliance is already working on bringing us Wi-Fi 7. When Wi-Fi 7 arrives, with its theoretical maximum speed of 46Gbps, Linux will be ready. As usual, the new Linux has many more built-in audio and graphics drivers. The Bcachefs filesystem didn&#x27;t make it into Linux 6.5, notes Vaughan-Nichols. &quot;While the Bcachefs filesystem looks good, there&#x27;s been a lot of developers fighting about the development process. These personal arguments have led Torvalds to decide not to incorporate Bcachefs into Linux 6.5.&quot;
 
Linus Torvalds announced Linux 6.5&#x27;s delivery in a brief post on August 27.

                              <span>According to research firm Antenna, Netflix had 2.6 million gross subscriber additions in July. &quot;The company also saw the highest percentage of new sign-ups going to its advertising tier since the $7-a-month offering hit the market last November,&quot; reports Deadline. &quot;About 23% of new subscribers opted for the ad tier, a gain of four percentage points over June levels.&quot; From the report: The overall July gains represented a 26% downturn from June&#x27;s record-breaking numbers, but they still show momentum stretching back to the May 23 introduction of paid password sharing in the U.S. From May 24 to 27, Netflix had its four biggest single days of sign-ups in the four-and-a-half years since Antenna has began tracking its subscribers, outpacing even the 2020 Covid boom.
 
The new password scheme followed last fall&#x27;s debut of the cheaper, ad-supported subscription tier, with the combination of the two providing a potent boost. In the second quarter ending June 30, the company reported that it doubled projections by adding 5.9 million subscribers, reaching 238.3 million worldwide.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Sports leagues are urging the US to require &quot;instantaneous&quot; takedowns of pirated livestreams and new requirements for Internet service providers to block pirate websites. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 requires websites to &quot;expeditiously&quot; remove infringing material upon being notified of its existence. But pirated livestreams of sports events often aren&#x27;t taken down while the events are ongoing, said comments submitted last week by Ultimate Fighting Championship, the National Basketball Association, and National Football League.
 
The &quot;DMCA does not define &#x27;expeditiously,&#x27; and OSPs [online service providers] have exploited this ambiguity in the statutory language to delay removing content in response to takedown requests,…</span>

                              <span>The PC market is expected to return to growth in 2024, according to estimates from IDC analysts. From a report: Still, industry players might want to taper their enthusiasm. PC shipments are forecast to grow 3.7 percent year-on-year to hit 261.4 million units in 2024, putting them above 2018 levels, but not quite on par with 2019 demand. Meanwhile, 2023 is predicted to sink by 13.7 percent to 252 million units. Research manager Jitesh Ubrani called demand &quot;tepid at best&quot; and said 2023 will be the year with the &quot;greatest annual decline in consumer PC shipments since the category&#x27;s inception.&quot; 

IDC recognizes the market still faces challenges including &quot;concerns around the consumer market refresh cycle, businesses pushing device purchases forward, and education budgets that are not rebounding in many markets.&quot; Market hesitancy, as always, boils down to uncertainty. For one, processors are seeing what IDC called &quot;some of the biggest shifts in commercial PC history&quot; as AMD market share hit 11 percent in 2022 and Apple pulled in just over 5 percent that year. Apple device sales have been on a decline for multiple quarters now. Q1 2023 saw new Macs plummet more than 40 percent year-on-year, compared to an overall 25-30 percent among PC vendors. The quarter before that saw Apple shipments outperform the PC market as a whole, declining a mere 2.1 percent while other manufacturers experienced 37 percent reductions.

                              <span>The FBI said Tuesday that it has taken down a network of hacked devices responsible for extorting tens of millions of dollars from victims around the world. From a report: US officials described the network known as Qakbot as one of the most notorious &quot;botnets&quot; in the world, referring to computer networks that have been infected with malicious software so that they can be controlled remotely without the owner&#x27;s knowledge -- often to send phishing emails. These emails can in turn be used to hack into victims&#x27; computer systems, which attackers will hold for ransom. 

Qakbot was instrumental in enabling cyberattacks against businesses and critical services around the world, according to US officials, including hits on the San Bernardino County Sheriff&#x27;s Department and hospitals run by Prospect Medical Group. The latter resulted in the closure of emergency rooms and medical facilities across the US. US officials estimated that, since its creation in 2008, Qakbot had infected around 200,000 computers in the US and 700,000 globally.

                              <span>Google DeepMind has launched a new watermarking tool that labels whether images have been generated with AI. From a report: The tool, called SynthID, will initially be available only to users of Google&#x27;s AI image generator Imagen, which is hosted on Google Cloud&#x27;s machine learning platform Vertex. Users will be able to generate images using Imagen and then choose whether to add a watermark or not. The hope is that it could help people tell when AI-generated content is being passed off as real, or help protect copyright. [...] Traditionally images have been watermarked by adding a visible overlay onto them, or adding information into their metadata. But this method is &quot;brittle&quot; and the watermark can be lost when images are cropped, resized, or edited, says Pushmeet Kohli, vice president of research at Google DeepMind. 

SynthID is created using two neural networks. One takes the original image and produces another image that looks almost identical to it, but with some pixels subtly modified. This creates an embedded pattern that is invisible to the human eye. The second neural network can spot the pattern and will tell users whether it detects a watermark, suspects the image has a watermark, or finds that it doesn&#x27;t have a watermark. Kohli said SynthID is designed in a way that means the watermark can still be detected even if the image is screenshotted or edited -- for example, by rotating or resizing it.

                              <span>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has paved the way for bitcoin exchange-traded funds. From a report: On Tuesday, the court sided with Grayscale in a lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission which had denied the company&#x27;s application to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to an ETF. The decision could impact other companies that want to create bitcoin ETFs, like BlackRock and Fidelity. A spot bitcoin ETF would be traded through a traditional stock exchange, although the bitcoin would be held by a brokerage, and would allow investors to gain exposure to the world&#x27;s biggest cryptocurrency without having to own the coin themselves. Many crypto bulls believe that approval of a spot bitcoin ETF will lead to more mainstream institutional adoption. 

Bitcoin, ether and other major cap crypto coins surged on the news, and Coinbase, which is listed as the custodian partner in multiple spot bitcoin ETF applications, was up more than 14% on Tuesday. &quot;The Commission failed to adequately explain why it approved the listing of two bitcoin futures ETPs but not Grayscale&#x27;s proposed bitcoin ETP,&quot; the court said, referring to exchange-traded products. &quot;In the absence of a coherent explanation, this unlike regulatory treatment of like products is unlawful.&quot; Grayscale Investments, which manages the world&#x27;s biggest crypto fund, initiated its lawsuit against the SEC in June 2022 after the agency rejected its application to turn its flagship bitcoin fund, better known by its ticker GBTC, into an ETF. The company decided to pursue the ETF, which would be backed by bitcoin rather than bitcoin derivatives, after the SEC approved ProShares&#x27; futures-based bitcoin ETF in October 2021.

                              <span>Google is making some big changes to Google Chat, its answer to Slack and Microsoft Teams. The messaging app -- aka the product formerly known as hangouts -- is getting a new design, some features that will feel distinctly familiar to Slack and Teams users, and a lot of Google&#x27;s new Duet AI collaboration tools. From a report: Most of the new features are rolling out later this year and early next, but they add up to a much more useful and competitive Chat platform. Duet is the flagship new feature and potentially a reason for a lot of Workspace users to start using Chat. You can use Duet to search and ask questions about all your stuff in Drive and Gmail and summarize both documents and conversations. You&#x27;ll also be able to use AI-powered autocorrect in Chat, and thanks to Smart Reply, you might never have to manually talk to your co-workers again. You&#x27;ll be able to talk to Duet in a one-on-one chat or invoke it in a group chat or a space to help get stuff done. &quot;You essentially have a co-worker who has infinite memory and amazing recall at your fingertips,&quot; says Vamsee Jasti, Google&#x27;s product lead for Chat. 

Outside of the AI integrations, Chat is also getting a facelift. The app has, until now, looked like a fairly barebones messaging app, with a list of conversations on the left and the active chat on the right; now, it&#x27;s going to have a lot more going on. (And, yes, it will look a lot more like Slack and Teams.) There will be a new home view with all your recent conversations, plus dedicated ways to see all your starred conversations and mentions. For now, everything will be reverse-chronological, but Google says it plans to start more intelligently organizing and ordering things next year. The interface as a whole is getting a bit of cleanup, too, with larger buttons and aesthetics borrowed from Google&#x27;s Material You design language.

                              <span>samleecole writes: A group of right to repair activists and consumer rights advocates are petitioning the Librarian of Congress for the right to hack McDonald&#x27;s notoriously unreliable McFlurry machines for the purposes of repair, according to a copy of the petition obtained by 404 Media. 

&quot;This is a request to expand the repair exemption for consumer electronic devices to include commercial industrial equipment such as automated building management systems and industrial equipment (i.e. soft serve ice cream machines and other industrial kitchen equipment),&quot; the proposal, written by right to repair group iFixit and the nonprofit Public Knowledge, says. In addition, iFixit got its hands on a Taylor ice cream machine and tore it down in an effort to determine why they are broken so damn often and published a new video showing the process of taking the machine apart and explaining why they&#x27;re always broken when you want fast food ice cream.

                              <span>When employees leave Google to join the artificial intelligence startup race, the search giant still has a way to benefit -- by keeping those former workers as cloud customers. From a report: More than half of venture-backed generative AI startups pay for Google&#x27;s cloud computing platform, Alphabet, Google&#x27;s parent company, said Tuesday. Of the startups valued at over $1 billion, 70% are Google Cloud customers, and about a third of those are helmed by former employees, including Anthropic, Character.ai and Cohere, the company said. That gives Google a way to extend its influence in the field even when it sheds talent. 

Google&#x27;s cloud unit, which reported a profit for the first time this year, has emerged as one of the company&#x27;s best bets for growth as its core search business matures. Google still trails Amazon&#x27;s AWS and Microsoft&#x27;s Azure in the market. But startups in the field of generative AI -- programs that can spin up images, text and video from simple prompts -- are increasingly turning to the company, said James Lee, Google Cloud&#x27;s general manager for startups and AI. &quot;We&#x27;re seeing strong momentum in our business, and we see Google Cloud as the preferred choice for startups building generative AI,&quot; Lee said in an interview. Google Cloud customers have the option to use AI models from Google itself as well as other companies, a degree of flexibility that appeals to startups, Lee said.

                              <span>For years, the Cargo team has encouraged Rust developers to
commit their Cargo.lock file for packages with binaries but not libraries.
We now recommend people
do what is best for their project.
To help people make a decision, we do include some considerations and suggest
committing Cargo.lock as a starting point in their decision making.
To align with that starting point, cargo new will no longer ignore
Cargo.lock for libraries as of nightly-2023-08-24.
Regardless of what decision projects make, we encourage regular
testing against their latest dependencies.
Background
The old guidelines ensured libraries tested their latest dependencies which

                              <span>Having not heard any significant disagreement with the first set of proposed priorities,
we are moving ahead with forming subgroups that will work towards defining and
completing the work needed to drive these forward. We plan to re-assess
priorities regularly, but for now these are our main work items (in no
particular order). We have some initial volunteers who will be pushing these
initiatives forward, but for all of these we are also looking for support from
any interested people. Please reach out on Zulip in #council if
you&#x27;d like to help out with any of these in some capacity, or to the initial
volunteers called out here.
Establishing plans for how to strengthen the moderation team (i.e., 2 is not a sustainable number) and strengthen moderation policies.

Josh Gould is leading, with support from Eric Holk. Their top priority is finding additional moderators and forming a contingent moderator team.
Figuring out the &quot;shape&quot; of the Rust Project. The Leadership Council needs to reflect the will of the Rust Project so it is important to know who that includes.

Eric Huss is leading, with support from Jack Huey. They&#x27;re working on defining the initial set of priorities here now.
Documenting and improving processes for interaction with the Rust Foundation including formalising the role of project directors in this process (the trademark policy process may be part of this).

We are looking for someone to help lead this initiative, with support from Mark Rousskov and Ryan Levick, two of the current  project directors. One of the proposed first concrete deliverables might be working towards a path forward on the trademark issue, using that as a stepping stone to defining broader policies. We&#x27;re intentionally looking for someone not directly involved previously to help give an outside perspective as the lead.
Please reach out if you&#x27;re interested in helping!</span>

                              <span>When people talk about great teams, they&#x27;ll talk about hard work, trust, respect, looking out for one another, etc. All good things.
But there&#x27;s one quality amongst teammates on great teams that often goes unrecognized by all but the most astute organizational observers: Admiration.
Great teams are made of people who *admire* one another&#x27;s talents, skills, character, and contributions. Great teams are mutual admiration societies who get to work together.
Admiration is the critical, silent variable in the powerful formula that equals exceptional teamwork.

If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, you can get 1.72.0 with:
rustup update stable

If you don&#x27;t have it already, you can get rustup from the appropriate page on our website, and check out the detailed release notes for 1.72.0 on GitHub.
If you&#x27;d like to help us out by testing future releases, you might consider updating locally to use the beta channel (rustup default beta) or the nightly channel (rustup default nightly). Please report any bugs you might come across!

                              <span>Cargo will be changing the order of merged configuration arrays, and we are looking for people to help test this change and provide feedback.
When an array in Cargo&#x27;s configuration is defined in multiple places, the elements are merged together. The order that the elements were merged was inconsistent with how other configuration types were merged together, and was not working as expected.
The new merging order will match the precedence order of non-array configuration, with higher-precedence configuration being placed later in the array.
In the case of build.rustflags, this resolves the confusing situation where higher precedence flags (in a project&#x27;s config.toml) are overridden with lower precedence flags (in the global $CARGO_HOME, for example).

It&#x27;s been over three years since my last blog post. I think that
the website code started to feel like it had bitrotted, and so making new blog
posts became onerous. But I&#x27;ve taken the time to redo this website
using Zig, so it&#x27;s quite easy to add blog
posts now, and plus I added
dark mode.
Twitter
Over the past few years I amassed a healthy number of followers on Twitter by posting
screenshots, demos, and small progress updates for the Zig programming language. It
felt good to gain an audience and have my perspective and efforts weighed more heavily in
the court of public opinion.
However, I always knew that it would need to end. It&#x27;s not really possible to use Twitter

                              <span>Many software teams create services exposed as APIs, designed to be
     consumed by other software and thus without any user-interface. Such
     services are hard to demonstrate, as they effectively just dump pages of
     JSON. A demo front-end is a simple user-interface just used to
     manipulate such an API. Matteo Vaccari describes how and
     why to build one - showing its usefulness both in explaining the
     API&#x27;s capabilities to stakeholders and to help client developers explore
     how to interact with the API.

                              <span>Here is a new article in the bottlenecks of scaleups series, looking at
     resilience and observability. Startups tend to only address resilience when
     their systems are already down, often taking a very reactive approach. For
     a scaleup, excessive system downtime represents a significant
     bottleneck to the organization, both from the effort expended on
     restoring function and also from the impact of customer dissatisfaction.
     Punit Lad and Carl Nygard explain that to
     move past this, resilience needs to be built into the business objectives,
     which will influence the architecture, design, product management, and even
     governance of business systems.

                              <span>When it comes to writing, the #1 question I usually get asked is how do I get so many HN front pages with this blog.
This week, Layerform got to the front page for the first time too, and I got asked that question another bunch of times.


I decided to write this document explaining how to do it so I can send people a link now.
As a heads-up, there is only one hack: making something people want (to upvote).
Also, keep in mind this is all public information on how HackerNews works. There’s no magic here.
Make your title direct and specific. Get straight to the point. Generic or vague titles do not perform well. Salesy titles perform even worse. Don’t worry about adding some technical detail. Explain what you do precisely.

     Naturally this leads to the question of how generative AI can help with
     this technique. Paul Sobocinski writes a brief memo
     explaining how some of our teams have used TDD with GitHub
     Copilot. As ever, co-pilot can&#x27;t be relied on to fly the plane, but
     can suggest some useful ideas for the red and green steps. It isn&#x27;t
     very helpful for the all-important refactoring step.

                              <span>Join Tim Cochran and Rickey Zachery on Thursday, September 7th 1-2pm EST
     for a webinar on Bottlenecks of
     Scaleups: Technology mistakes every growing startup makes. They researched
     Thoughtwork&#x27;s portfolio to analyze why companies struggle to scale,
     spanning across Technology, People, and Product. Covering areas such as
     experimentation culture, overcomplicated architectures, onboarding,
     developer productivity, product and engineering collaboration, and cost
     efficiency.

                              <span>Any business that wants to grow needs to be built on strong and stable
     foundations. While these strategic directions are often familiar to
     technical folks it&#x27;s important that the improvements to engineering align
     with the themes that resonate with the rest of the organization.
     Sarah Taraporewalla illustrates how this appears with two
     strategic directions that consider improvements in efficiency and quality.

Concepts from functional programming
When people talk about functional programming, I think of a few key
choices you can make while programming:
Immutability by default
(Tail) recursion by default
First-class functions (and the suite of tools that go along with it. e.g. map, reduce/fold)

                              <span>We are saddened today to learn of the passing of Stefan Tilkov. We’ve met Stefan several times at workshops and conferences and always enjoyed his good company and insightful views. He advocated many of the things that we and our colleagues support - and as well as skillfully explaining these ideas, he also backed them up with concrete experience from his work. We shall really miss his wise contributions online, and regret that we won’t get the chance to chat with him again. We offer our condolences to his family, friends, and colleagues at INNOQ.

                              <span>There is complex and there is difficult, they are not the same. 


Being able to run a marathon is very difficult. But what you have to do to prepare is simple. A small sheet of paper is enough to describe the steps. You will need tremendous effort and discipline - so it’s hard - but it is simple.


Software development is different: it is also complex.


A common theme in my articles on how we do Rails at 37signals is how facing software development with rigid recipes is naive and counterproductive. A good example is services: using a service for everything is a simple idea; applying domain-driven design and object orientation is not. Another manifestation is banning techniques because they can be harmful: concerns, accessing the database from models, callbacks, globals, etc. Ironically, the alternative critics usually recommend for those is using services.


In software, you must take a Babylonian body of knowledge, combine it with your own experience, and apply the result to make countless daily decisions. And of all this for a problem you can’t understand without solving it first. Rigidity doesn’t work, and – because this is a game of intricate complexity – it yields more harm than benefit. You need to embrace nuance.


Mind the recipes you follow.

                              <span>A great many smart people terminably hamper their ability to better understand the world by refusing to accept defeat when reality proves them wrong. Armed with an intellect that&#x27;s at once both too proud to recognize it&#x27;s own failings and cunningly capable of producing sophisticated excuses, they&#x27;re adapt at spotting this failing in others but not in themselves.
You see this all the time in the realm of public policy. Someone presents a plausible thesis on how to deal with a given problem. They drum up support for an attempt that follows their ideas, but when the attempt is defeated by reality, they can&#x27;t retreat, and become stuck trying to defend the path in ever-more creative yet ludicrous ways.

                              <span>One of the most fascinating aspects of Tesla&#x27;s rise to dominance has been how they discarded many of the traditional values of car making. While the rest of the industry was stuck competing on the size of their panel gaps, and other aspects of precision and quality assembly, Tesla didn&#x27;t even show up to participate. Their cars are legendary for being delivered with shoddy paint jobs, rattling interiors, and even mismatched doors. But it just didn&#x27;t matter! Consumers voted with their wallets for poorly built EVs because well-built gas-powered cars were deemed irrelevant in comparison.
There&#x27;s tremendous wisdom for product makers of all kinds in this lesson. It&#x27;s the epitome of Blue Ocean Strategy. To find a breakthrough angle in commerce, it&#x27;s as important to decide where you will not compe…</span>

                              <span>My colleague Sarah Taraporewalla describes an approach
     to building technology strategy that challenges the convention. It starts
     by identifying the overall strategic directions that the organization is
     considering, and using common aspects of these directions to indicate the
     investigations needed for the organization to understand the technology
     implications raised by that strategic change. This first
     installment looks at two of these directions: expanding the business
     by creating complementary products, and expanding the business into new
     markets and regions.

                              <span>It&#x27;s hard not to see your spirits lifted when you&#x27;re part of bringing something to life. Be that a product, an organization, or a community, or all three at once. Like exercise, it&#x27;s one of those rare avenues of human endeavor that almost invariably will make anyone feel better. And, also like exercise, the hard part is getting started when you need it the most!
That&#x27;s the curious chasm between knowledge and action. As much as you may know that regular, high-intensity training of the body does wonders for the mind, summoning the motivation to follow through with a commitment to working out only gets harder and harder the more you need it. I&#x27;ve had periods in my life where being removed from meaningful acts of creation felt just the same way.
Those periods were especially depressing when they felt like a simulacra of creation. Being in a situation designed to mimic the motions of making, but bereft of any meaningful progress towards that end. The pretending of purpose. The appearance of collaboration. Without any thrust towards completion.
And just as how getting a positive streak of accomplishment going provides its own momentum to keep at it, so too does a negative streak of performative busyness. It pulls you back into the comfort of the mental couch, and hands you the bag of chips to soothe your nagging sense of uselessness. For every day you stay there, the harder it is to get up, so best to muster everything you got to escape the dulling inertia now.
Make something. Participate in something. Engage with someone. All of it might feel as unnatural as strapping on those running shoes after too long of a break, but once you&#x27;re back to creating, the energy comes by itself.</span>

                              <span>The corporate cause for return-to-office just claimed its perhaps most ironic victim: Zoom! The company that literally lives to sell us all on the wonders of remote collaboration wants its own people back into the office again. Which I guess is just a regression to the mean of productivity tool makers failing to believe their own marketing, but it&#x27;s a bit sad none the less.
Not the least because this push for return-to-office has now been proven completely safe for large tech corporations. Thanks to the mixture of mass layoffs earlier this year and the now numerous proclamations that remote-first is over at the majority of big companies. Safety in sentiment, safety in numbers.
This is an opportunistic squeeze, because what&#x27;s most tech workers supposed to do? The option of simply hopping to another company has been severely limited. Outside the small realm of AI experts, most other domains just aren&#x27;t anywhere nearly as contested in hiring as they once were. So this is happening now because it can happen now.
I just hope that people who really did enjoy that remote work-lifetyle don&#x27;t forget what it was like. The balance of power will presumably turn around one day again, and when it does, voting with your feet will be an option again.
Until then, I suspect that the likes of Shopify, Automattic, and other stalwart defenders of remote work will continue to see their openings become increasingly oversubscribed. Just like we&#x27;ve had at 37signals for going on two decades.
Remote work might be receding, but it&#x27;s simply too compelling an option for too many to ever disappear. The long-term trend line ain&#x27;t going anywhere.</span>

                              <span>Hello, Rustaceans!
For the 6th year in a row, the Rust Project conducted a survey on the Rust programming language, with participation from project maintainers, contributors, and those generally interested in the future of Rust. This edition of the annual State of Rust Survey opened for submissions on December 5 and ran until December 22, 2022.
First, we&#x27;d like to thank you for your patience on these long delayed results. We hope to identify a more expedient and sustainable process going forward so that the results come out more quickly and have even more actionable insights for the community.
The goal of this survey is always to give our wider community a chance to express their opinions about the language we all love and help shape its future. We’re grateful to those of you who took the …</span>

Nobody describes it better than Richard Feynman:
In the South Seas there is a Cargo Cult of people.  During the war they saw airplanes land with lots of good materials, and they want the same thing to happen now.  So they’ve arranged to make things like runways, to put fires along the sides of the runways, to make a wooden hut for a man to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head like headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas — he’s the controller — and t…</span>

                              <span>Many software developers seem to have a uniquely hard time accepting that not everyone who just tries real hard will become so good as to be among the best in this field. That there really is a discrepancy of talent that leads to a discrepancy of competence. That not everyone can or will become equally good at this job.
In contrast, nobody seems to have trouble with the fact that not every soccer player who loves the game and trains their best will become eligible for the Premier League. Or that becoming a brain surgeon might indeed really be harder than making it as a general practitioner, which in itself is hard enough too!
But becoming a developer can happen without ever really having to face an adversarial examination of your skills. There&#x27;s no 90-minute clock that ends with a look at …</span>

                              <span>The Rust team has published a new point release of Rust, 1.71.1. Rust is a
programming language that is empowering everyone to build reliable and
efficient software.
If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, getting Rust
1.71.1 is as easy as:
rustup update stable

If you don&#x27;t have it already, you can get rustup from the
appropriate page on our website.
What&#x27;s in 1.71.1 stable
Rust 1.71.1 fixes Cargo not respecting the umask when extracting dependencies,
which could allow a local attacker to edit the cache of extracted source code
belonging to another local user, potentially executing code as another user.
This security vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2023-38497, and you can read
more about it on the advisory we published earlier today. We
recommend all users to update their toolchain as soon as possible.
Rust 1.71.1 also addresses several regressions introduced in Rust 1.71.0,
including bash completion being broken for users of Rustup, and the
suspicious_double_ref_op being emitted when calling borrow() even though it
shouldn&#x27;t.
You can find more detailed information on the specific regressions, and other
minor fixes, in the release notes.
Contributors to 1.71.1
Many people came together to create Rust 1.71.1. We couldn&#x27;t have done it
without all of you. Thanks!</span>

when extracting crate archives on UNIX-like systems. If the user downloaded a
