Into the depleted field of journalism in America, a handful of websites have appeared in recent weeks with names suggesting a focus on news close to home: D.C. Weekly, the New York News Daily, the Chicago Chronicle and a newer sister publication, the Miami Chronicle. In fact, they are not local news organizations at all. They are Russian creations, researchers and government officials say, meant to mimic actual news organizations to push Kremlin propaganda by interspersing it among an at-times odd mix of stories about crime, politics and culture. 

While Russia has long sought ways to influence public discourse in the United States, the fake news organizations — at least five, so far — represent a technological leap in its eff…</span>

Some of the numbers lead back to a single individual: Sam Altman. The co-founder and chief executive of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI owns an 8.7 percent stake in Reddit, more than its co-founder and CEO, Steve Huffman, who owns 3.3 percent... Altman, through various funds and holding companies he owns or manages, controls more than a million shares of Reddit at $60 million in aggregate purchase price — and holds more than 9 percent of voting rights...

&quot;Starting in the 1950s, it would have marked a time when humanity&#x27;s influence on the planet became overwhelming.&quot;

The vote, first reported by The New York Times, is a stunning — though not unexpected — rebuke for the proposal, which has been working its way through a formal approval process for more than a decade...

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this article from Futurism:

More than two years since MIT claimed its scientists achieved a breakthrough in fusion energy, the university is claiming that new research &quot;confirms&quot; that the magnet-based design used in those tests isn&#x27;t just impressive in a lab setting, but is practical and economically viable, too. 

These findings come from a comprehensive report which features six separate [peer-reviewed] studies published in the journal IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity this month, assessing the feasibility of the superconductor magnets used by MIT scientists in their landmark test conducted in September 2021. 

&quot;Together, the papers describe the design and fabrication of the magnet and the diagnostic equipment needed to evaluate its performance,&quot; MIT announced, &quot;as well as the lessons learned from the process. 

&quot;Overall, the team found, the predictions and computer modeling were spot-on, verifying that the magnet&#x27;s unique design elements could serve as the foundation for a fusion power plant.&quot;
The successful test of the magnet, says Hitachi America Professor of Engineering Dennis Whyte, who recently stepped down as director of MIT&#x27;s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, was &quot;the most important thing, in my opinion, in the last 30 years of fusion research.&quot; Before the [2021] demonstration, the best-available superconducting magnets were powerful enough to potentially achieve fusion energy — but only at sizes and costs that could never be practical or economically viable. Then, when the tests showed the practicality of such a strong magnet at a greatly reduced size, &quot;overnight, it basically changed the cost per watt of a fusion reactor by a factor of almost 40 in one day,&quot; Whyte says. 
&quot;Now fusion has a chance,&quot; Whyte adds

Benefiting from the crisis were big players, like JPMorgan Chase. After acquiring First Republic&#x27;s $212.6 billion in loans and $92.4 billion in deposits for just over $10 billion in May 2023, JPMorgan saw a 67 percent year-over-year growth in profits that quarter. Overall, larger commercial banks saw inflows as customers sought safer institutions to hold their money. 
And what happened to Silicon Valley Bank? Axios reports:

That got devs thinking. As is, IRC isn&#x27;t user-friendly. It&#x27;s a kind of an arcane magic involving strange commands. Its onboarding is obtuse. And the protocol doesn&#x27;t natively support things like media sharing (screenshots are useful when troubleshooting), clickable links, or other modern &quot;niceties&quot;. And yet, IRC is a fast, established, open, and versatile protocol... It&#x27;s free and immediate (no sign-up required to use it) which makes it ideal for &#x27;when you need it&#x27; use.

You&#x27;ve just upgraded to an Apple IIgs, your first &quot;16-bit&quot; computer. To relieve the crushing boredom of your High School coursework, you and your friends embark on the computer geek equivalent of forming a heavy metal band: Making your own video game. You meet at the benches during lunch hour, and pass around crude plans scribbled on graph paper. You assign each other impressive titles like &quot;Master Programmer&quot;, &quot;Sound Designer&quot;, and &quot;Area Data Input&quot;. You swap 3.5&quot; disks like furtive secret agents, and stay up coding untl 3am. Your parents look at your owlish eyes — and your slipping grades — and ask if you&#x27;re &quot;on drugs&quot;. If that sounds familiar, this essay may prove interesting. It uses the game my friends and I started — but didn&#x27;t finish — in High School over 30 years ago, to explore the absurd programming contortions we did to make it playable on the Apple IIgs: The red-headed stepchild of the Apple II line; a machine that languished for six years without a hardware upgrade to avoid competing with the Macintosh. Thanks to the recent release of the first cycle-accurate emulator for this machine, you can actually play the game in all its screen-tearing glory. You can also explore the source code which has survived for 30 years, and been adapted to build on modern hardware thanks to Merlin32 and CiderPress II.

&quot;Nowadays, the content of the game itself is only good for an embarrassing laugh,&quot; according to the web page, &quot;but I feel that the code we hammered out shows the unique challenges of a bygone era, which should be remembered...&quot;

Exposure to leaded gasoline lowered the IQ of about half the population of the United States, a new study estimates. The peer-reviewed study, published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, focuses on people born before 1996 — the year the U.S. banned gas containing lead. 

Overall, the researchers from Florida State University and Duke University found, childhood lead exposure cost America an estimated 824 million points, or 2.6 points per person on average. Certain cohorts were more affected than others. For people born in the 1960s and the 1970s, when leaded gas consumption was skyrocketing, the IQ loss was estimated to be up to 6 points and for some, more than 7 points. Exposure to it came primarily from inhaling auto exhaust.
 

&quot;Lead is a neurotoxin, and no amount of it is safe.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this article from the Washington Post:


A much-debated theory holds that 4 billion years ago, give or take, long before the appearance of dinosaurs or even bacteria, the primordial soup contained only the possibility of life. Then a molecule called RNA took a dramatic step into the future: It made a copy of itself. Then the copy made a copy, and over the course of many millions of years, RNA begot DNA and proteins, all of which came together to form a cell, the smallest unit of life able to survive on its own. 

Now, in an important advance supporting this RNA World theory, scientists at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, Calif., have carried out a small but essential part of the story. In test tubes, they developed an RNA molecule that was able to make accurate copies of a different type of RNA. The work, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, gets them closer to the grand goal of growing an RNA molecule that makes accurate copies of itself. 
&quot;Then it would be alive,&quot; said Gerald Joyce, president of Salk and one of the authors of the new paper. &quot;So, this is the road to how life can arise in a laboratory or, in principle, anywhere in the universe....&quot; 

John Chaput, a professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of California at Irvine who did not participate in the study, called the crossing of that threshold by the Salk team &quot;monumental,&quot; adding that &quot;at first, I looked on it as a little bit jaw-dropping. ... It&#x27;s super-neat.&quot; 
The Post adds that &quot;the scenario they tested probably mimics one of the earliest stirrings of evolution.&quot; And Michael Kay, a professor of biochemistry at University of Utah, says the new paper has given the RNA World theory &quot;key evidence&quot; to show &quot;it is plausible and reasonable.&quot;

He added that the RNA copier developed at Salk will &quot;provide a valuable tool for people wanting to do directed evolution experiments.&quot;

                              <span>Legislation proposed in California &quot;aims to repeal Daylight saving time and put California permanently on Standard time,&quot; reports a San Diego news station: 

In November 2018, California voters passed Prop 7, a measure that would allow the state legislature to change Daylight saving time by either keeping it year-round or getting rid of it altogether. However, this measure also requires approval by the U.S. Congress if California were to opt for year-round Daylight Saving Time. So far, nothing has materialized. 


&quot;I am really, really passionate about this bill,&quot; said State Assembly Member Tri Ta, who added it is finally time to listen to the will of the voters. He has drafted new legislation that to do away with twice-yearly time changes. However, his bill would put the Golden State onto year-round Standard time: a move that would not require federal action. Oregon and Washington state are also considering similar moves [though Oregon&#x27;s bill appears stalled]. &quot;If my bill is passed, we do not need congressional approval,&quot; Ta told CBS 8, &quot;so that&#x27;s a win-win for everyone....&quot; 



Ta said that his bill has the support of the California Medical Association, as well as sleep experts who say Standard time syncs better with our natural clocks. &quot;So why don&#x27;t we go along with science?&quot; Ta added. &quot;That&#x27;s what I believe.&quot; One things most people seem to agree on: it&#x27;s time to stop changing our clocks, which research has shown leads to higher rates of accidents as well as increased health risks. 

&quot;While this new bill continues to work its way through Sacramento, Daylight saving time is still a go here in California,&quot; the article points out, &quot;starting 2 a.m. Sunday, when we set our clocks forward one hour.&quot; 

But USA Today adds that across the rest of the country, &quot;Most Americans — 62% — are in favor of ending the time change, according to an Economist/YouGov poll from last year.&quot;

                              <span>&quot;A 20-year-old Trojan resurfaced recently,&quot; reports Dark Reading, &quot;with new variants that target Linux and impersonate a trusted hosted domain to evade detection.&quot;


Researchers from Palo Alto Networks spotted a new Linux variant of the Bifrost (aka Bifrose) malware that uses a deceptive practice known as typosquatting to mimic a legitimate VMware domain, which allows the malware to fly under the radar. Bifrost is a remote access Trojan (RAT) that&#x27;s been active since 2004 and gathers sensitive information, such as hostname and IP address, from a compromised system. 

There has been a worrying spike in Bifrost Linux variants during the past few months: Palo Alto Networks has detected more than 100 instances of Bifrost samples, which &quot;raises concerns among security experts and organizations,&quot; researchers Anmol Murya and Siddharth Sharma wrote in the company&#x27;s newly published findings. 

Moreover, there is evidence that cyberattackers aim to expand Bifrost&#x27;s attack surface even further, using a malicious IP address associated with a Linux variant hosting an ARM version of Bifrost as well, they said... &quot;As ARM-based devices become more common, cybercriminals will likely change their tactics to include ARM-based malware, making their attacks stronger and able to reach more targets.&quot;

                              <span>Like Platform Adjacency Theory and The Core Web Platform Loop, this post started[1] as a set of framing devices that I&#x27;ve been sketching on whiteboards for the best part of a decade. These lenses aren&#x27;t perfect, but they provide starting points for thinking about the complex dynamics of browsers, OSes, &quot;native&quot; platforms, and the standards-based Web platform.
There are only two-and-a-half reasons to build a browser, and they couldn&#x27;t be more different in intent and outcome, even when they look superficially similar. Learning to tell the difference is helpful for browser project managers and engineers, but also working web developers who struggle to develop theories of change for affecting browser teams.

                              <span>An anonymous Slashdot reader shared this article from Live Science:


Manufacturers will no longer use harmful &quot;forever chemicals&quot; in food packaging products in the U.S., according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 

In a statement released February 28, the agency declared that grease-proofing materials that contain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) will not be used in new food packaging sold in the U.S. These include PFAS used in fast-food wrappers, microwave popcorn bags, takeout boxes and pet food bags. The FDA&#x27;s announcement marks the completion of a voluntary phase-out of the materials by U.S. food packaging manufacturers. 

This action will eliminate the &quot;major source of dietary exposure to PFAS,&quot; Jim Jones, deputy commissioner for human foods at the FDA, said in an associated statement. Companies told the FDA that it could take up to 18 months to completely exhaust the market supply of these products following their final date of sale. However, most of the affected manufacturers phased out the products faster than they initially predicted, the agency noted... 

The FDA&#x27;s new announcement marks a &quot;huge win for the public,&quot; Graham Peaslee, a professor of physics at the University of Notre Dame who studies PFAS, told The Washington Post.

Red Hat was abandoning Linux end-user fans for enterprise customers by closing down Red Hat Linux 9 and launching the business-friendly Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Oh, and South African tech millionaire and astronaut Mark Shuttleworth [also a Debian Linux developer] launched Canonical, Ubuntu Linux&#x27;s parent company. 

&quot;Little did I — or anyone else — suspect that Canonical would become one of the world&#x27;s major Linux companies.&quot; 

Mark Shuttleworth answered questions from Slashdot reader in 2005 and again in 2012. And this year, Canonical celebrates its 20th anniversary. ZDNet reports:

For his 2022 science project, Sener recreated the Archimedes screw, a device for raising and moving water. But he didn&#x27;t stop there.

&quot;Reanalysis of seismic data now suggests Loeb may have been looking for the meteor remnants in the wrong place,&quot; writes the Washington Post:

The analysis, led by seismologist Benjamin Fernando of Johns Hopkins University, contends that sound waves purportedly from the meteor exploding in the atmosphere, and cited by Loeb as helping to locate the meteor&#x27;s debris field, were most likely from a truck driving on a road near the seismometer.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this report from the Washington Post:

The Earth just observed its warmest February, setting a monthly record for the ninth time in a row, the European Union&#x27;s Copernicus Climate Change Service announced Wednesday. 

The unrelenting and exceptional global warmth — fueled by a combination of human-caused warming and the El Niño climate pattern — has spanned both land and ocean areas since June. It has scientists worried about the planet crossing a critical climate threshold and prospects for an active Atlantic hurricane season. The month&#x27;s average global air temperature of 13.5 degrees Celsius (56.3 degrees Fahrenheit) was 0.12 degrees (0.22 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the previous warmest February in 2016. 

The warmth of the last 12-month period is unprecedented in modern records, coming in at 1.56 degrees (2.8 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than preindustrial levels... Scientists fear that tipping points, such as those that could lead to catastrophic sea level rises or the collapse of critical ocean circulations, will become more likely to be reached if the Earth&#x27;s temperature remains near or above that threshold for multiple years. 

 Axios adds:

This is significant, since these 12 months exceeded the Paris Agreement&#x27;s 1.5-degree target for a full year. However, the pact is aimed at averting multiple decades above that level, meaning the target hasn&#x27;t yet been officially breached. Europe was especially warm compared to average during February, along with central and northwest North America, much of South America, Africa and western Australia, Copernicus found. 

The Washington Post notes that in the United States, &quot;more than 200 locations in the Midwest and Northeast set records for winter warmth.&quot; 

They also quote a weather historian who posted on social media that &quot;We are witnessing something extraordinary and unprecedented. Several thousands of records pulverized all over the world in a matter of hours, with margins never seen before.&quot;

                              <span>&quot;Shares of Rivian Automotive surged 13% on Thursday,&quot; reports CNBC, &quot;as the EV maker unveiled three new vehicles and announced more than $2 billion in savings related to pausing construction on a plant in Georgia.&quot; 

CNBC notes that Rivian&#x27;s current vehicles &quot;start at roughly $70,000 and can top $100,000,&quot; so the new cheaper R2 midsize SUV (starting at $45,000) could be more appealing. 

&quot;Especially if it qualifies for the $7,500 EV tax credit,&quot; adds the Verge:

&quot;Seven percent of new vehicle sales are electric,&quot; [Rivian founder and CEO RJ] Scaringe notes.... &quot;The reality is that Tesla continues to be wildly successful, and we want to pull from that 93 percent that haven&#x27;t made the jump to pure EV, because the form factor didn&#x27;t fit their lifestyle.&quot;

                              <span>A recent survey found that academic organizations are failing to preserve digital material -- &quot;including science paid for with taxpayer money,&quot; reports Ars Technica, highlighting the need for improved archiving standards and responsibilities in the digital age. From the report: The work was done by Martin Eve, a developer at Crossref. That&#x27;s the organization that organizes the DOI system, which provides a permanent pointer toward digital documents, including almost every scientific publication. If updates are done properly, a DOI will always resolve to a document, even if that document gets shifted to a new URL. But it also has a way of handling documents disappearing from their expected location, as might happen if a publisher went bankrupt. There are a set of what&#x27;s called &quot;dark archives…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Android Police: Seven years ago, Google announced that it would phase out all Chrome apps on Windows, Mac, and Linux by 2018 (it would actually take until 2023). In its place would be what the company called Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), web apps that can be installed on a user&#x27;s desktop that act as if they are practically natural apps and programs. The idea grew quickly, with Chrome users having installed PWAs in record numbers by the beginning of 2022. Soon, every website will be installable on desktops through PWAs.
 
In Chrome Canary (the daily build version of Google Chrome and typically a couple of versions ahead of the stable build), websites can now be installed on desktops. As part of the latest daily build, Google has added an &quot;Install page as app&quot; option to the &quot;Save and share&quot; submenu on the desktop version (via @Leopeva64 on X). This makes clicking the app -- which is just the website made to look and feel like a native app -- always open in its own window. Sites that already have their own PWAs, like YouTube or Reddit, have been prompting users to install them for a while now and will have their &quot;Install page as app&quot; function actually showing the name of the site. For example, YouTube&#x27;s entry will show as &quot;Install YouTube.&quot; In February, it became possible to enable the flags necessary to make any website into a PWA, but it seems to have just now become fully implemented.

                              <span>Longtime Slashdot reader AmiMoJo shares a report from The Guardian: Akira Toriyama, the influential Japanese manga artist who created the Dragon Ball series, has died at the age of 68. He died on March 1 from an acute subdural haematoma. The news was confirmed by Bird Studio, the manga company that Toriyama founded in 1983.
 
&quot;It&#x27;s our deep regret that he still had several works in the middle of creation with great enthusiasm,&quot; the studio wrote in a statement. &quot;Also, he would have many more things to achieve.&quot; The studio remembered his &quot;unique world of creation&quot;. &quot;He has left many manga titles and works of art to this world,&quot; the statement read. &quot;Thanks to the support of so many people around the world, he has been able to continue his creative activities for over 45 years.&quot; [...]
 
Based on an earlier work titled Dragon Boy, Dragon Ball was serialized in 519 chapters in Weekly Shonen Jump from 1984 to 1995 and birthed a blockbuster franchise including an English-language comic book series, five distinct television adaptation -- with Dragon Ball Z the most familiar to western audiences -- and spin-offs, over 20 different films and a vast array of video games. The series -- a kung fu take on the shonen (or young adult) manga genre -- drew from Chinese and Hong Kong action films as well as Japanese folklore. It introduced audiences to the now-instantly familiar Son Goku -- a young martial arts trainee searching for seven magical orbs that will summon a mystical dragon -- as well as his ragtag gang of allies and enemies. You can learn more about Toriyama via the Dragon Ball Wiki.
 
The Associated Press, Washington Post, and New York Times, among others, have all reported on his passing.

                              <span>Lindsay Clark reports via The Register: Palantir has won a US Army contract worth $178.4 million to house a battlefield intelligence system inside a big truck. In what purports to be the Army&#x27;s first AI-defined vehicle, Palantir will provide systems for the TITAN &quot;ground station,&quot; which is designed to access space, high altitude, aerial, and terrestrial sensors to &quot;provide actionable targeting information for enhanced mission command and long range precision fires&quot;, according to a Palantir statement.
 
TITAN stands for Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node, which might sound harmless enough. Who was ever killed by a node?

                              <span>Space.com describes it as &quot;a nearly 3-ton leftover tossed overboard from the International Space Station&quot; — which crashed back to earth today. One satellite tracker claims to have filmed it passing over the Netherlands... 



&quot;A couple minutes later reentry and it would have reached Fort Meyers&quot; in Florida, posted astronomer Jonathan McDowell of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. But instead it re-entered the earth&#x27;s atmosphere &quot;over the Gulf of Mexico between Cancun and Cuba,&quot; Friday afternoon. &quot;This was within the previous prediction window but a little to the northeast of the &#x27;most likely&#x27; part of the path.&quot; 

From Space.com:


The multi-ton Exposed Pallet 9 (EP9) was jettisoned from the space station back in March 2021. At the time, it was reported to be the most massive object ever tossed overboard from the International Space Station. Disposing of used or unnecessary equipment in such a way is common practice aboard the space station, as the objects typically burn up harmlessly in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. 
Ahead of EP9&#x27;s reentry, the Federal Office for Civil Protection and Disaster Relief, National Warning Center 1 in Bonn, Germany issued this information... &quot;The object is battery packs from the International Space Station. Luminous phenomena or the perception of a sonic boom are possible....&quot; EP9 is loaded with old Nickel-Hydrogen batteries, NASA explained at the time it was jettisoned, also explaining that EP9 has the approximate mass of a large SUV and predicting it would re-enter Earth&#x27;s atmosphere in two-to-four years.
 
&quot;A large space object reenters the atmosphere in a natural way approximately once per week,&quot; the European Space Agency points out, &quot;with the majority of the associated fragments burning up before reaching the ground. 
&quot;Most spacecraft, launch vehicles and operational hardware are designed to limit the risks associated with a reentry.&quot;

                              <span>Google&#x27;s swanky new office building located on the Alphabet&#x27;s Mountain View, California headquarters has been &quot;plagued for months by inoperable, or, at best, spotty Wi-Fi,&quot; reports Reuters citing six people familiar with the matter. &quot;Its recliner-laden collaborative workspaces do not work well for teams carting around laptops, since workers must plug into ethernet cables at their desks to get consistent internet service. Some make do by using their phones as hotspots.&quot; From the report: The company promoted the new building and surrounding campus in a 229-page glossy book highlighting its cutting-edge features, such as &quot;Googley interiors&quot; and &quot;an environment where everyone has the tools they need to be successful.&quot;
 
But, a Google spokeswoman acknowledged, &quot;we&#x27;ve had Wi-Fi connectivity issues in Bay View.&quot; She said Google &quot;made several improvements to address the issue,&quot; and the company hoped to have a fix in coming weeks. According to one AI engineer assigned to the building, which also houses members of the advertising team, the wonky Wi-Fi has been no help for Google pushing a three day per week return-to-office mandate. &quot;You&#x27;d think the world&#x27;s leading internet company would have worked this out,&quot; he said.
 
Managers have encouraged workers to stroll outside or sit at the adjoining cafe where the Wi-Fi signal is stronger. Some were issued new laptops recently with more powerful Wi-Fi chips. Google has not publicly disclosed the reasons for the Wi-Fi problems, but workers say the 600,000-square-foot building&#x27;s swooping, wave-like rooftop swallows broadband like the Bermuda Triangle.

                              <span>Michael McWhertor reports via Polygon: Warner Bros. Discovery is telling developers it plans to start &quot;retiring&quot; games published by its Adult Swim Games label, game makers who worked with the publisher tell Polygon. At least three games are under threat of being removed from Steam and other digital stores, with the fate of other games published by Adult Swim unclear. The media conglomerate&#x27;s planned removal of those games echoes cuts from its film and television business; Warner Bros. Discovery infamously scrapped plans to release nearly complete movies Batgirl and Coyote vs. Acme, and removed multiple series from its streaming services. If Warner Bros. does go through with plans to delist Adult Swim&#x27;s games from Steam and digital console stores, 18 or more games could be affected.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from MobileSyrup: Google&#x27;s new smart assistant, Gemini, is available on multiple devices but Gemini Nano, the multimodal large language model, isn&#x27;t coming to all Pixel smartphones. Gemini Nano is only available on the Google Pixel 8 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S24 series; however, we&#x27;ve recently learned that it&#x27;s not making its way to the base Pixel 8, according to Terence Zhang, an engineer at Google and reporter by Mishaal Rahman.
 
Zhang told everyone that Gemini Nano isn&#x27;t coming to the Pixel 8 because of hardware limitations, but it&#x27;s unclear what the hardware limitations are. Many would assume it&#x27;s due to the Pixel 8 housing only 8GB of RAM compared to the Pixel 8 Pro&#x27;s 12GB. That said, the Galaxy S24 series starts at 8GB of RAM and can use Nano. This must mean that some other hardware limitations are holding back Gemini Nano. Hopefully, more information will come in the future, but right now, it seems like only high-end devices will get the Gemini Nano experience.

And then they blew it.
  If it wasn&#x27;t all so terribly dark and sad, it would actually be funny. Rendering George Washington as a Black man. Equivocating on whether Musk&#x27;s memes are worse or not than actual, literal Hitler. Oh, and defending pedophilia. Yeah, the Gemini launch had it all. Like a risqué stand-up comic shocking her audience for effect. Except, Gemini wasn&#x27;t joking.

                              <span>As reported by The Information (paywalled), OpenAI CEO Sam Altman will return to the company&#x27;s board along with three new directors. Reuters reports: The company has also concluded the investigation around Altman&#x27;s November firing, the Information said, referring to the ouster that briefly threw the world&#x27;s most prominent artificial intelligence company into chaos. Employees, investors and OpenAI&#x27;s biggest financial backer, Microsoft had expressed shock over Altman&#x27;s ouster, which was reversed within days. The company will also announce the appointment of three new directors, Sue Desmond-Hellmann, a former CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Nicole Seligman, a former president of Sony Entertainment, and Fidji Simo, CEO of Instacart, the Information said. &quot;I&#x27;m pleased this whole thing is over,&quot; Altman said.
 
&quot;We are excited and unanimous in our support for Sam and Greg [Brockman],&quot; OpenAI chair and former Salesforce executive Bret Taylor told reporters. Taylor said they also adopted &quot;a number of governance enhancements,&quot; such as a whistleblower hotline and a new mission and strategy committee on the board. &quot;The mission has not changed, because it is more important than ever before,&quot; added Taylor.
 
An independent investigation by the law firm WilmerHale determined that &quot;the prior Board acted within its broad discretion to terminate Mr. Altman, but also found that his conduct did not mandate removal.&quot; The summary, provided by OpenAI, continued: &quot;The prior Board believed at the time that its actions would mitigate internal management challenges and did not anticipate that its actions would destabilize the Company. The prior Board&#x27;s decision did not arise out of concerns regarding product safety or security, the pace of development, OpenAI&#x27;s finances, or its statements to investors, customers, or business partners. Instead, it was a consequence of a breakdown in the relationship and loss of trust between the prior Board and Mr. Altman.&quot;

These include two in January and, crucially, a new DMCA filed this week against Chase Wackerfuss, the coder of a repository called âoeReactle,â which cloned Wordle in React JS (JavaScript).

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: AMD announced this week that it has ceased FreeSync certification for monitors or TVs whose maximum refresh rates are under 144 Hz. Previously, FreeSync monitors and TVs could have refresh rates as low as 60 Hz, allowing for screens with lower price tags and ones not targeted at serious gaming to carry the variable refresh-rate technology. AMD also boosted the refresh-rate requirements for its higher AdaptiveSync tiers, FreeSync Premium and FreeSync Premium Pro, from 120 Hz to 200 Hz.
 
Here are the new minimum refresh-rate requirements for FreeSync, which haven&#x27;t changed for laptops. AMD will continue supporting already-certified FreeSync displays even if they don&#x27;t meet the above requirements. Interestingly, AMD&#x27;s minimum refresh-rate requirements for TVs goes beyond 120 Hz, which many premium TVs max out at currently, due to the current-generation Xbox and PlayStation supporting max refresh rates of 120 frames per second (FPS). Announcing the changes this week in a blog post, Oguzhan Andic, AMD FreeSync and Radeon product marketing manager, claimed that the changes were necessary, noting that 60 Hz is no longer &quot;considered great for gaming.&quot; Andic wrote that the majority of gaming monitors are 144 Hz or higher, compared to in 2015, when FreeSync debuted, and even 120 Hz was &quot;a rarity.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Dario Amodei, chief executive of the high-profile A.I. start-up Anthropic, told Congress last year that new A.I. technology could soon help unskilled but malevolent people create large-scale biological attacks, such as the release of viruses or toxic substances that cause widespread disease and death. Senators from both parties were alarmed, while A.I. researchers in industry and academia debated how serious the threat might be. Now, over 90 biologists and other scientists who specialize in A.I. technologies used to design new proteins -- the microscopic mechanisms that drive all creations in biology -- have signed an agreement that seeks to ensure that their A.I.-aided research will move forward without exposing the world to serious harm. 

The biologists, who include the Nobel laureate Frances Arnold and represent labs in the United States and other countries, also argued that the latest technologies would have far more benefits than negatives, including new vaccines and medicines. &quot;As scientists engaged in this work, we believe the benefits of current A.I. technologies for protein design far outweigh the potential for harm, and we would like to ensure our research remains beneficial for all going forward,&quot; the agreement reads. The agreement does not seek to suppress the development or distribution of A.I. technologies. Instead, the biologists aim to regulate the use of equipment needed to manufacture new genetic material. This DNA manufacturing equipment is ultimately what allows for the development of bioweapons, said David Baker, the director of the Institute for Protein Design at the University of Washington, who helped shepherd the agreement.

                              <span>Astronomers have observed a distant planet that could be entirely covered in a deep water ocean, in findings that advance the search for habitable conditions beyond Earth. From a report: The observations, by Nasa&#x27;s James Webb space telescope (JWST), revealed water vapour and chemical signatures of methane and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of the exoplanet, which is twice Earth&#x27;s radius and about 70 light years away. This chemical mix is consistent with a water world where the ocean would span the entire surface, and a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, according to researchers from the University of Cambridge, although they do not envisage a balmy, inviting seascape. &quot;The ocean could be upwards of 100 degrees [Celsius] or more,&quot; said Prof Nikku Madhusudhan, who led the analysis. At high atmospheric pressure, an ocean this hot could still be liquid, &quot;but it&#x27;s not clear if it would be habitable,&quot; he added. 

This interpretation is favoured in a paper published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics Letters, but is disputed by a Canadian team that made additional observations of the same exoplanet, which is known as TOI-270 d. They detected the same atmospheric chemicals but argue the planet would be too hot for liquid water -- possibly 4,000C -- and instead would feature a rocky surface topped by an incredibly dense atmosphere of hydrogen and water vapour. Whichever view wins out, these latest observations showcase the stunning insights James Webb is giving into the nature of planets beyond our solar system. The telescope captures the starlight that has been filtered through the atmospheres of orbiting planets to give detailed breakdowns of the chemical elements present. From this, astronomers can build up a picture of conditions at a planet&#x27;s surface -- and the likelihood of life being able to survive there.

                              <span>Microsoft has abruptly pulled a feature from OneDrive that allows users to upload files to the cloud storage service directly from a URL. From a report: The feature turned up as a preview in 2021 and was intended for scenarios &quot;where the file contents aren&#x27;t available, or are expensive to transfer,&quot; according to Microsoft. It was particularly useful for mobile users, for whom uploading files directly through their apps could be costly. Much better to simply point OneDrive at a given URL and let it handle the upload itself. 

However, the experimental feature never made it past the consumer version of OneDrive. It also didn&#x27;t fit with Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;vision for OneDrive as a cloud storage service that syncs your files across devices.&quot; Indeed, the idea of hosing data into OneDrive from a remote source sits at odds with the file synchronization model being championed by Microsoft and conveniently available from macOS and Windows.

                              <span>Epic Games, in a blog post: Apple has told us and committed to the European Commission that they will reinstate our developer account. This sends a strong signal to developers that the European Commission will act swiftly to enforce the Digital Markets Act and hold gatekeepers accountable. We are moving forward as planned to launch the Epic Games Store and bring Fortnite back to iOS in Europe. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney adds: The DMA went through its first major challenge with Apple banning Epic Games Sweden from competing with the App Store, and the DMA just had its first major victory. Following a swift inquiry by the European Commission, Apple notified the Commission and Epic that it would relent and restore our access to bring back Fortnite and launch Epic Games Store in Europe under the DMA law.

                              <span>A United Airlines Holdings aircraft ran off the taxiway into a grassy area after landing at Houston Friday, the third incident this week involving the airline&#x27;s Boeing planes. From a report: United Flight 2477, with 160 passengers and six crew, had just landed at George Bush Intercontinental Airport about 8 a.m. local time Friday when it veered into the grass on a turn. No one was injured, and passengers left the plane on a set of stairs before being bused to the terminal, the airline said. 

The incident follows the mid-air loss of a tire from a United Boeing 777-200 Thursday, just after the plane took off from San Francisco on a flight to Osaka, Japan, and an engine fire on a United flight from Houston to Fort Myers, Florida, earlier this week. The plane in the Houston-to-Florida flight had to make an emergency landing after one of its engines burst into flames 10 minutes after takeoff. The 21-year-old aircraft was also a 737 -- but an earlier version than the Max, according to FlightRadar24.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: In the 1960s, secret test flights of advanced government spy planes generated U.F.O. sightings. More recently, government and commercial drones, new kinds of satellites and errant weather balloons have led to a renaissance in unusual observations. But, according to a new report, none of these sightings were of alien spacecraft. The new congressionally mandated Pentagon report found no evidence that the government was covering up knowledge of extraterrestrial technology and said there was no evidence that any U.F.O. sightings represented alien visitation to Earth. 

The 63-page document is the most sweeping rebuttal the Pentagon has issued in recent years to counter claims that it has information on extraterrestrial visits or technology. But amid widespread distrust of the government, the report is unlikely to calm a growing obsession with aliens. Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder, a Defense Department spokesman, said the Pentagon approached the report with an open mind and no preconceived notions, but simply found no evidence to back up claims of secret programs, hidden alien technology or anything else extraterrestrial. The new report suggests that the public&#x27;s belief that the government is hiding what it knows will probably continue. The report adds: Nevertheless the public is unlikely to be swayed. Many people dismiss the government&#x27;s claims that nothing interesting is going on in Pentagon videos that appear to show strange objects, citing accounts by Navy pilots that they observed objects whose movements cannot be easily explained. The new report notes that in the past, particularly in the 1950s, there was interest in U.F.O.s, but today the attention on unexplained sightings is greater than ever before. Politico adds: The Pentagon has disclosed that the government once considered a program to recover and reverse-engineer any captured alien spacecraft, an effort that never came to fruition but fueled conspiracy theories about a cover-up.

                              <span>Astra Space, a California-based rocket company, has announced it will go private at a valuation significantly lower than its $2.1 billion debut in 2021. The company&#x27;s market value is about $13 million at current levels. The company&#x27;s co-founders, Chris Kemp and Adam London, will acquire all outstanding shares at $0.50 each, well below the current trading price of $0.80. Astra has faced challenges, with only two successful launches out of seven attempts of its Rocket 3 vehicle. The company pivoted to the larger Rocket 4 in 2022 but has yet to conduct test launches. 

Astra faces competition from established players like Rocket Lab and Firefly, as well as new entrants such as ABL Space and Stoke Space. The company&#x27;s future remains uncertain as it navigates a competitive small launch market, with SpaceX&#x27;s Transporter missions offering lower prices by launching dozens of satellites simultaneously on its Falcon 9 booster.

                              <span>Microsoft revealed earlier this year that Russian state-sponsored hackers had been spying on the email accounts of some members of its senior leadership team. Now, Microsoft is disclosing that the attack, from the same group behind the SolarWinds attack, has also led to some source code being stolen in what Microsoft describes as an ongoing attack. From a report: &quot;In recent weeks, we have seen evidence that Midnight Blizzard [Nobelium] is using information initially exfiltrated from our corporate email systems to gain, or attempt to gain, unauthorized access,&quot; explains Microsoft in a blog post. &quot;This has included access to some of the company&#x27;s source code repositories and internal systems. To date we have found no evidence that Microsoft-hosted customer-facing systems have been compromised.&quot; 

It&#x27;s not clear what source code was accessed, but Microsoft warns that the Nobelium group, or &quot;Midnight Blizzard,&quot; as Microsoft refers to them, is now attempting to use &quot;secrets of different types it has found&quot; to try to further breach the software giant and potentially its customers. &quot;Some of these secrets were shared between customers and Microsoft in email, and as we discover them in our exfiltrated email, we have been and are reaching out to these customers to assist them in taking mitigating measures,&quot; says Microsoft.

                              <span>President Biden included a nod to a rising issue in the entertainment and tech industries during his State of the Union address Thursday evening, calling for a ban on AI voice impersonations. From a report: &quot;Here at home, I have signed over 400 bipartisan bills. There&#x27;s more to pass my unity agenda,&quot; President Biden said, beginning to list off a series of different proposals that he hopes to address if elected to a second term. &quot;Strengthen penalties on fentanyl trafficking, pass bipartisan privacy legislation to protect our children online, harness the promise of AI to protect us from peril, ban AI voice impersonations and more.&quot; 

The president did not elaborate on the types of guardrails or penalties that he would plan to institute around the rising technology, or if it would extend to the entertainment industry. AI was a peak concern for SAG-AFTRA during the actors union&#x27;s negotiations with and strike against the major studios last year.

                              <span>Michael Larabel writes via Phoronix: Fedora Workstation has long defaulted to using GNOME&#x27;s Wayland session by default, but it has continued to install the GNOME X.Org session for fallback purposes or those opting to use it instead. But for the Fedora Workstation 41 release later in the year, there is a newly-approved plan to no longer have that GNOME X.Org session installed by default. Recently there was a Fedora Workstation ticket opened to no longer install the GNOME X.Org session by default. This is just about whether the X.Org session is pre-installed but would continue to live in the repository for those wanting to explicitly install it.
 
The Fedora Workstation working group decided to go ahead with this change for the Fedora 41 cycle, not the upcoming Fedora 40 release. So pending any obstacles by FESCo, which is unlikely. Fedora Workstation 41 will not be installing the GNOME X.Org session by default. Long live Wayland.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Week Magazine: The advancement of new technologies appears to have given rise to a new problem across the United States: a crippling power shortage on the horizon. The advent of these technologies, such as eco-friendly factories and data centers, has renewed concerns that America could run out of electrical power. These worries also come at a time when the United States&#x27; aging power grid is in desperate need of repair. Heavily publicized incidents such as the 2021 Texas power outage, which was partially blamed on crypto-farming, exposed how vulnerable the nation&#x27;s power supply is, especially during emergencies. There have also been warnings from tech moguls such as Elon Musk, who has stated that the United States is primed to run out of electric…</span>

                              <span>In an updated support page, Apple says it won&#x27;t let your iPhone update software installed by third-party app stores if you leave the European Union for more than 30 days. The Verge reports: Shortly after the EU&#x27;s Digital Markets Act (DMA) went into effect on Wednesday, users noticed an Apple support page stating users would &quot;lose access to some features&quot; when leaving the EU &quot;for short-term travel.&quot; But now, Apple has made this policy more specific by carving out a 30-day grace period, which could be inconvenient for frequent travelers. This doesn&#x27;t change your ability to use alternative app marketplaces, however, as Apple says you can still use third-party stores to manage apps you&#x27;ve already installed.

                              <span>Researchers have developed a way to circumvent safety measures built into large language models (LLMs) using ASCII Art, a graphic design technique that involves arranging characters like letters, numbers, and punctuation marks to form recognizable patterns or images. Tom&#x27;s Hardware reports: According to the research paper ArtPrompt: ASCII Art-based Jailbreak Attacks against Aligned LLMs, chatbots such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, and Llama2 can be induced to respond to queries they are designed to reject using ASCII art prompts generated by their ArtPrompt tool. It is a simple and effective attack, and the paper provides examples of the ArtPrompt-induced chatbots advising on how to build bombs and make counterfeit money. [...]
 
To best understand ArtPrompt and how it works, it is probably simplest to check out the two examples provided by the research team behind the tool. In Figure 1 [here], you can see that ArtPrompt easily sidesteps the protections of contemporary LLMs. The tool replaces the &#x27;safety word&#x27; with an ASCII art representation of the word to form a new prompt. The LLM recognizes the ArtPrompt prompt output but sees no issue in responding, as the prompt doesn&#x27;t trigger any ethical or safety safeguards.
 
Another example provided [here] shows us how to successfully query an LLM about counterfeiting cash. Tricking a chatbot this way seems so basic, but the ArtPrompt developers assert how their tool fools today&#x27;s LLMs &quot;effectively and efficiently.&quot; Moreover, they claim it &quot;outperforms all [other] attacks on average&quot; and remains a practical, viable attack for multimodal language models for now.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from BleepingComputer: FBI&#x27;s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) has released its 2023 Internet Crime Report (PDF), which recorded a 22% increase in reported losses compared to 2022, amounting to a record of $12.5 billion. The number of relevant complaints submitted to the FBI in 2023 reached 880,000, 10% higher than the previous year, with the age group topping the report being people over 60, which shows how vulnerable older adults are to cybercrime. Both figures continue a worrying trend seen by the agency since 2019, where complaints and losses rise yearly. For 2023, the types of crimes that increased were tech support scams and extortion, whereas phishing, personal data breach, and non-payment/non-delivery scams slightly waned.

                              <span>The European Union has confirmed it&#x27;s looking into Apple&#x27;s decision to close Epic Games&#x27; developer account -- citing three separate regulations that may apply. From a report: Yesterday the Fortnite maker revealed Apple had terminated the account, apparently reversing a decision to approve the developer account last month. Epic had planned to launch its own app store, the Epic Games Stores, on iOS in Europe, as well as Fortnight on Apple&#x27;s platform. And it accused Apple of breaching the bloc&#x27;s Digital Markets Act (DMA) by killing its developer account. 

Responding to the development, a European Commission spokesperson told TechCrunch it has &quot;requested further explanations on this from Apple under the DMA.&quot; The pan-EU regulation applies on Apple from midnight Brussels&#x27; time today. The spokesperson also said the EU is evaluating whether Apple&#x27;s actions raise compliance &quot;doubts&quot; with regard to two other regulations -- the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the platform-to-business regulation (P2B) -- given what they described as &quot;the links between the developer program membership and the App Store as designated VLOP&quot; (very large online platform).

                              <span>A directive known as Document 79 ramps up Beijing&#x27;s effort to replace U.S. tech with homegrown alternatives. From a report: For American tech companies in China, the writing is on the wall. It&#x27;s also on paper, in Document 79. The 2022 Chinese government directive expands a drive that is muscling U.S. technology out of the country -- an effort some refer to as &quot;Delete A,&quot; for Delete America. Document 79 was so sensitive that high-ranking officials and executives were only shown the order and weren&#x27;t allowed to make copies, people familiar with the matter said. It requires state-owned companies in finance, energy and other sectors to replace foreign software in their IT systems by 2027. 

American tech giants had long thrived in China as they hot-wired the country&#x27;s meteoric industrial rise with computers, operating systems and software. Chinese leaders want to sever that relationship, driven by a push for self-sufficiency and concerns over the country&#x27;s long-term security. The first targets were hardware makers. Dell, International Business Machines and Cisco Systems have gradually seen much of their equipment replaced by products from Chinese competitors. 

Document 79, named for the numbering on the paper, targets companies that provide the software -- enabling daily business operations from basic office tools to supply-chain management. The likes of Microsoft and Oracle are losing ground in the field, one of the last bastions of foreign tech profitability in the country. The effort is just one salvo in a yearslong push by Chinese leader Xi Jinping for self-sufficiency in everything from critical technology such as semiconductors and fighter jets to the production of grain and oilseeds. The broader strategy is to make China less dependent on the West for food, raw materials and energy, and instead focus on domestic supply chains.

The company announced three new series without specifying the panel types, but reports suggest that even within the S90D series, both QD-OLED and WOLED may be used. Samsung&#x27;s decision to use both panel types is attributed to LG Display&#x27;s request not to position WOLED as inferior to QD-OLED.

                              <span>The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) will start providing more hands-on support to open-source software developers as they work to better secure their projects, the agency said. From a report: CISA hosted a two-day, invite-only summit this week with leaders in the open-source software community and other federal officials. During the private event, the agency also ran what&#x27;s likely the first tabletop exercise to assess how well the government and the open-source community would respond to a cyberattack targeting one of their projects. 

During the summit, CISA and a handful of package repositories unveiled new initiatives to help secure open-source projects. CISA is working on a new communication channel where open-source software developers can share threat intelligence and ask the agency for assistance during an incident. The Rust Foundation is developing new public key infrastructure for its repository, which will help ensure that the code developers are uploading isn&#x27;t malicious and is coming from legitimate users. 

npm, which manages the JavaScript programming language, is requiring project maintainers to enroll in multi-factor authentication and is rolling out a tool to generate &quot;software bills of materials,&quot; which provide a recipe list of what code and other elements are in a project. Additional repositories -- including the Python Software Foundation, Packagist, Composer and Maven Central -- are pursuing similar projects and also also rolling out tools to help detect and report malware and other security vulnerabilities.

                              <span>Apple is preparing to allow EU-based iPhone users to uninstall its first-party Safari browser by the end of 2024 and is working on a more &quot;user-friendly&quot; way of transferring data &quot;from an iPhone to a non-Apple phone&quot; by fall 2025. From a report: That&#x27;s according to a new compliance document published by the company, which outlines all the ways it&#x27;s complying with the European Union&#x27;s new Digital Markets Act that comes into force this week. 

Other user-facing initiatives detailed in Apple&#x27;s document include a &quot;browser switching solution&quot; to transfer data between browsers on the same device, which it plans to make available by late 2024 or early 2025. It&#x27;ll also be possible to change the default navigation app on iOS by March 2025 in the EU. The document doesn&#x27;t explicitly state whether any of these features will be available globally or whether they&#x27;ll be exclusive to users in the EU. But many of the company&#x27;s previously announced plans to comply with the DMA -- including the ability to run browser engines other than WebKit and install third-party app stores -- are only available in the bloc.

                              <span>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday approved a rule that will require some public companies to report their greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks, after last-minute revisions that weakened the directive in the face of strong pushback from companies. From a report: The rule was one of the most anticipated in recent years from the nation&#x27;s top financial regulator, drawing more than 24,000 comments from companies, auditors, legislators and trade groups over a two-year process. It brings the U.S. closer to the European Union and California, which moved ahead earlier with corporate climate disclosure rules. 

The SEC rule passed 3-2, with three Democratic commissioners supporting it and two Republicans opposed. Since the SEC proposed a rule two years ago, experts had said it was likely to face litigation almost immediately. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, one of the Democrats, acknowledged that was a factor the agency considered as it worked toward a final rule. &quot;We&#x27;ve seriously considered what people have said about our legal authorities,&quot; Gensler said on Wednesday.

                              <span>EA CEO Andrew Wilson believes generative AI will &quot;revolutionize&quot; the gaming industry over the next five years. He predicts that the technology will allow for more efficient content creation, reducing development time from months to days. From a report: Greater efficiency coupled with &quot;deeper, more immersive experiences&quot; will lead to significant audience expansion over the next few years and provide a &quot;multi-billion dollar&quot; growth opportunity, he said. Wilson said that in the past it might take six months to build an in-game sports stadium. Over the last 12 months, that time has shrunk to six weeks, and over the coming years it could maybe be cut to six days. 

And while FIFA 23 has 12 run cycles for how the players move in the game, EA Sports FC 24 has 1,200 created with generative AI. Over the next five years, Wilson hopes that generative AI will make EA&#x27;s development 30% more efficient, help grow its 700 million-strong player base by &quot;at least&quot; 50%, and lead to players spending 10-20% more money on its games. &quot;What we&#x27;ve seen every time there&#x27;s been a meaningful technological advancement in media and in technology, where you are able to democratise an industry and hand it over to the population at large, incredible things happen,&quot; he said.

                              <span>The 46-year-old probe, which flew by Jupiter and Saturn in its youth and inspired earthlings with images of the planet as a &quot;Pale Blue Dot,&quot; hasn&#x27;t sent usable data from interstellar space in months. From a report: When Voyager 1 launched in 1977, scientists hoped it could do what it was built to do and take up-close images of Jupiter and Saturn. It did that -- and much more. Voyager 1 discovered active volcanoes, moons and planetary rings, proving along the way that Earth and all of humanity could be squished into a single pixel in a photograph, a &quot;pale blue dot,&quot; as the astronomer Carl Sagan called it. It stretched a four-year mission into the present day, embarking on the deepest journey ever into space. Now, it may have bid its final farewell to that faraway dot. 

Voyager 1, the farthest man-made object in space, hasn&#x27;t sent coherent data to Earth since November. NASA has been trying to diagnose what the Voyager mission&#x27;s project manager, Suzanne Dodd, called the &quot;most serious issue&quot; the robotic probe has faced since she took the job in 2010. The spacecraft encountered a glitch in one of its computers that has eliminated its ability to send engineering and science data back to Earth. The loss of Voyager 1 would cap decades of scientific breakthroughs and signal the beginning of the end for a mission that has given shape to humanity&#x27;s most distant ambition and inspired generations to look to the skies.

                              <span>The hype around AI language models has companies scrambling to hire prompt engineers to improve their AI queries and create new products. But new research hints that the AI may be better at prompt engineering than humans, indicating many of these jobs could be short-lived as the technology evolves and automates the role. IEEE Spectrum: Battle and Gollapudi decided to systematically test [PDF] how different prompt engineering strategies impact an LLM&#x27;s ability to solve grade school math questions. They tested three different open source language models with 60 different prompt combinations each. What they found was a surprising lack of consistency. Even chain-of-thought prompting sometimes helped and other times hurt performance. &quot;The only real trend may be no trend,&quot; they write. &quot;What&#x27;s best for any given model, dataset, and prompting strategy is likely to be specific to the particular combination at hand.&quot; 

There is an alternative to the trial-and-error style prompt engineering that yielded such inconsistent results: Ask the language model to devise its own optimal prompt. Recently, new tools have been developed to automate this process. Given a few examples and a quantitative success metric, these tools will iteratively find the optimal phrase to feed into the LLM. Battle and his collaborators found that in almost every case, this automatically generated prompt did better than the best prompt found through trial-and-error. And, the process was much faster, a couple of hours rather than several days of searching.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: Google today is sharing more details about the fees that will accompany its plan to comply with Europe&#x27;s new Digital Markets Act (DMA), the new regulation aimed at increasing competition across the app store ecosystem. While Google yesterday pointed to ways it already complied with the DMA -- by allowing sideloading of apps, for example -- it hadn&#x27;t yet shared specifics about the fees that would apply to developers, noting that further details would come out this week. That time is now, as it turns out.
 
Today, Google shared that there will be two fees that apply to its External offers program, also announced yesterday. This new program allows Play Store developers to lead their users in the EEA outside their app, including to promote o…</span>

                              <span>Apple&#x27;s responses to the Digital Market Act, its recent 1.8b euro fine in the Spotify case, and Epic Sweden&#x27;s plans to introduce an alternative App Store in the EU have all been laced with a surprising level of spite and obstinacy. Even when Steve Jobs was pulling power moves with Adobe and Flash or responding to Antennagate, we never saw such an institutional commitment to flipping off legislators and platform partners. It might have been ruthless, but it didn&#x27;t come across as personal.
 Which is curious! Because you&#x27;d think that a creative thinker like Steve Jobs would be more likely to wear his heart on his sleeve than a professional bean counter like Tim Cook. More likely to lash out. But assuming Cook is still signing off on the company&#x27;s strategy, and it&#x27;s hard to imagine otherwise, …</span>

I&#x27;ve been flowing freely from Windows to Linux, sampling text editors like VSCode, neovim, Helix, and Sublime, while surveying PC laptops and desktops. It&#x27;s been an adventure! But it&#x27;s time to stop being a tourist. It&#x27;s time to commit. 
 So despite my earlier reservations about giving up on TextMate, I&#x27;ve decided to make Windows my new primary abode. That&#x27;s Windows with Linux running inside of it as a subsystem (WSL), mind you. I would never have contemplated a switch to Windows without being able to run Linux inside it. But it&#x27;s still a change of scenery you could not possibly have convinced me was in the cards a few years ago!

                              <span>Trust in AI technology and the companies that develop it is dropping, in both the U.S. and around the world, according to new data from Edelman shared first with Axios. Axios reports: Globally, trust in AI companies has dropped to 53%, down from 61% five years ago. In the U.S., trust has dropped 15 percentage points (from 50% to 35%) over the same period. Trust in AI is low across political lines. Democrats trust in AI companies is 38%, independents are at 25% and Republicans at 24%. Tech is losing its lead as the most trusted sector. Eight years ago, technology was the leading industry in trust in 90% of the countries Edelman studies. Today, it is the most trusted in only half of countries.
 
People in developing countries are more likely to embrace AI than those in developed ones. Respondents in France, Canada, Ireland, UK, U.S., Germany, Australia, the Netherlands and Sweden reject the growing use of AI by a three-to-one margin, Edelman said. By contrast, acceptance outpaces resistance by a wide margin in developing markets such as Saudi Arabia, India, China, Kenya, Nigeria and Thailand. &quot;When it comes to AI regulation, the public&#x27;s response is pretty clear: &#x27;What regulation?&#x27;,&quot; said Edelman global technology chair Justin Westcott. &quot;There&#x27;s a clear and urgent call for regulators to meet the public&#x27;s expectations head on.&quot;

As TechCrunch notes, it&#x27;s &quot;a crucial step before the company opens the program up to the public.&quot; From the report: The step forward comes just a few days after Waymo won the ability to start charging for rides in expanded territory across both Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area. Waymo didn&#x27;t offer a timeline for when it plans to start offering autonomous rides to the citizens of Austin. When it does, it will become the fourth city where the company&#x27;s robotaxis are officially in operation, following LA, SF and Phoenix.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Register: Criminals have probably stolen nearly 30,000 Fidelity Investments Life Insurance customers&#x27; personal and financial information -- including bank account and routing numbers, credit card numbers and security or access codes -- after breaking into Infosys&#x27; IT systems in the fall. According to Fidelity, in documents filed with the Maine attorney general&#x27;s office, miscreants &quot;likely acquired&quot; information about 28,268 people&#x27;s life insurance policies after infiltrating Infosys.
 
&quot;At this point, [Infosys] are unable to determine with certainty what personal information was accessed as a result of this incident,&quot; the insurer noted in a letter [PDF] sent to customers. However, the US-headquartered firm says it &quot;believes&quot; the data included: na…</span>

                              <span>JPMorgan helped some of its corporate customers slash manual work by almost 90% (alternative source) with its cashflow management tool that runs on AI, bringing the largest US bank one step closer to charging for this service. From a report: &quot;We are going to keep investing into this solution because we see that we&#x27;re starting to really crack this workflow,&quot; said Tony Wimmer, head of data and analytics at JPMorgan&#x27;s wholesale payments unit, in an interview. Since launching about a year ago, his firm now has about 2,500 clients using the product, he said. 

The tool, which allows corporate treasuries to analyse and forecast cash flows, has seen &quot;tremendous&quot; interest from its clients who currently use it for free, Wimmer said. His firm is considering charging its customers in the future to use the solution, dubbed Cash Flow Intelligence. The world&#x27;s biggest banks have been stepping up their use of artificial intelligence with the aim of lifting productivity and reducing costs. JPMorgan&#x27;s Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has said the technology could eventually allow employers to shrink the workweek to just 3.5 days. JPMorgan set a target of $1 billion in &quot;business value&quot; generated by AI in 2023, and the firm increased that goal to $1.5 billion at its investor day in May.

                              <span>A washing-machine-sized satellite is to &quot;name and shame&quot; the worst methane polluters in the oil and gas industry. From a report: MethaneSat will provide the first near-comprehensive global view of leaks of the potent greenhouse gas from the oil and gas sector, and all of the data will be made public. It will provide high-resolution data over wider areas than existing satellites. Methane, also called natural gas, is responsible for 30% of the global heating driving the climate crisis. Leaks from the fossil fuel industry are a major source of human-caused emissions and stemming these is the fastest single way to curb temperature rises. 

MethaneSat was developed by the Environmental Defense Fund, a US NGO, in partnership with the New Zealand Space Agency and cost $88m to build and launch. Earlier EDF measurements from planes show methane emissions were 60% higher than calculated estimates published by US authorities and elsewhere. More than 150 countries have signed a global methane pledge to cut their emissions of the gas by 30% from 2020 levels by 2030. Some oil and gas companies have made similar pledges, and new regulations to limit methane leaks are being worked on in the US, EU, Japan and South Korea. 

The EDF&#x27;s senior vice-president, Mark Brownstein, said: &quot;MethaneSat is a tool for accountability . I&#x27;m sure many people think this could be used to name and shame companies who are poor emissions performers, and that&#x27;s true. But [it] can [also] help document progress that leading companies are making in reducing their emissions.&quot; The oil and gas industry knows how to stop leaks and the cost of doing so is usually very modest, said Steven Hamburg, the EDF&#x27;s chief scientist and MethaneSat project leader: &quot;Some call it low hanging fruit. I like to call it fruit lying on the ground.&quot;

Wired: The coalition of top law enforcement officials, spearheaded by New York attorney general Letitia James, says the &quot;dramatic and persistent spike&quot; in complaints concerning account takeovers amounts to a &quot;substantial drain&quot; on governmental resources, as many stolen accounts are also tied to financial crimes -- some of which allegedly profits Meta directly. 

&quot;We have received a number of complaints of threat actors fraudulently charging thousands of dollars to stored credit cards,&quot; says the letter addressed to Meta&#x27;s chief legal officer, Jennifer Newstead. &quot;Furthermore, we have received reports of threat actors buying advertisements to run on Meta.&quot; &quot;We refuse to operate as the customer service representatives of your company,&quot; the officials add. &quot;Proper investment in response and mitigation is mandatory.&quot;

                              <span>Epic Games, in a blog post: We recently announced that Apple approved our Epic Games Sweden AB developer account. We intended to use that account to bring the Epic Games Store and Fortnite to iOS devices in Europe thanks to the Digital Markets Act (DMA). To our surprise, Apple has terminated that account and now we cannot develop the Epic Games Store for iOS. This is a serious violation of the DMA and shows Apple has no intention of allowing true competition on iOS devices. 

The DMA requires Apple to allow third-party app stores, like the Epic Games Store. Article 6(4) of the DMA says: &quot;The gatekeeper shall allow and technically enable the installation and effective use of third-party software applications or software application stores using, or interoperating with, its operating system and allow those software applications or software application stores to be accessed by means other than the relevant core platform services of that gatekeeper.&quot; 

In terminating Epic&#x27;s developer account, Apple is taking out one of the largest potential competitors to the Apple App Store. They are undermining our ability to be a viable competitor and they are showing other developers what happens when you try to compete with Apple or are critical of their unfair practices. If Apple maintains its power to kick a third party marketplace off iOS at its sole discretion, no reasonable developer would be willing to utilize a third party app store, because they could be permanently separated from their audience at any time. Apple said one of the reasons it terminated Epic&#x27;s developer account only a few weeks after approving it was because the Fortnite-maker publicly criticized its proposed DMA compliance plan, Epic said.

                              <span>During a recent Morgan Stanley conference, Warner Bros. Discovery gaming boss J.B. Perrette discussed some of the company&#x27;s strategy for gaming going forward, and it includes more live-service, mobile, and free-to-play games. From a report: He said, &quot;We&#x27;re doubling down on games as an area where we think there is a lot more growth opportunity that we can tap into with the IP that we have and some of the capabilities we have on the studio where we&#x27;re uniquely positioned as both a publisher and a developer of games.&quot; 

Perrette said WBD&#x27;s recent gaming output has focused on AAA games for console, and that&#x27;s great when a game like Hogwarts Legacy sells 22 million copies and becomes the best-selling game of the year, but this kind of success is never guaranteed in what Perrette said was a &quot;volatile&quot; market. He pointed out that one of WBD&#x27;s latest big games, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, was a disappointment for the company. 

So the plan going forward, he said, is to help reduce volatility by focusing on core franchises and bringing at least some of them to the mobile and free-to-play space, as well as continuing to invest in live-service games that people play--and spend money on--over a long period of time. This will help WBD generate more consistent revenue, he said, going on to tease that WBD had some new mobile free-to-play games coming this year. Also worth noting is that just because WBD may push into new places, that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it will stop making big single-player AAA games.

                              <span>Spain has moved to block Sam Altman&#x27;s cryptocurrency project Worldcoin, the latest blow to a venture that has raised controversy in multiple countries by collecting customers&#x27; personal data using an eyeball-scanning &quot;orb.&quot; From a report: The AEPD, Spain&#x27;s data protection regulator, has demanded that Worldcoin immediately ceases collecting personal information in the country via the scans and that it stops using data it has already gathered. The regulator announced on Wednesday that it had taken the &quot;precautionary measure&quot; at the start of the week and had given Worldcoin 72 hours to demonstrate its compliance with the order. 

Worldcoin, co-founded by Altman in 2019, has been offering tokens of its own cryptocurrency to people around the world, in return for their consent to have their eyes scanned by an orb. The scans are used as a form of identification as it seeks to create a reliable mechanism to distinguish between humans and machines as artificial intelligence becomes more advanced.

From a report: With iOS 17.4, iPhone users in the EU can now access third-party app marketplaces -- pending availability which is expected any day -- but extended overseas travel could change that, according to Apple.

                              <span>Carriers have gotten stricter about how many items you can take on board, no matter how small they are. From a report: Fanny packs. Cross-body bags. Shopping bags. Pillows and blankets. The Southwest Airlines gate agent rattled off so many items that counted toward the two carry-on bag limit on my flight to Baltimore, I thought it might be a playful jab at Spirit and Frontier and their rigid carry-on policing to collect more fees. But this was no joke. Southwest quietly began cracking down on carry-on bags on Feb. 22, ahead of the spring and summer travel rush, advising gate agents of the changes in a memo. This crackdown isn&#x27;t about bag size. It is about how many bags you have. 

Southwest isn&#x27;t alone in putting passengers&#x27; personal items in its crosshairs as a way to save precious bin space and speed up boarding. Delta and United agents have also recently asked me to stuff my small Lululemon bag in my backpack. One American Airlines frequent flier told me he watched gate agents in Sacramento, Calif., and Dallas list a litany of items that count as a personal item on weekend flights to Nashville, Tenn., last month. Carting all your stuff to the gate can save you time and often saves money, especially with some airlines&#x27; new, higher checked-baggage fees. Delta joined the club on Tuesday, announcing prices of $35 for your first bag and $45 for your second. But testing airlines&#x27; carry-on limits is now more likely to backfire, and lose you precious time as airlines make you consolidate items or check a bag at the gate.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: On a late night in December, Shane Jones, an AI engineer at Microsoft, felt sickened by the images popping up on his computer. Jones was noodling with Copilot Designer, the AI image generator that Microsoft debuted in March 2023, powered by OpenAI&#x27;s technology. Like with OpenAI&#x27;s DALL-E, users enter text prompts to create pictures. Creativity is encouraged to run wild. Since the month prior, Jones had been actively testing the product for vulnerabilities, a practice known as red-teaming. In that time, he saw the tool generate images that ran far afoul of Microsoft&#x27;s oft-cited responsible AI principles.

                              <span>A new report warns that a boom in computer chip manufacturing in the US could fuel demand for dirty energy, despite companies&#x27; environmental claims. The solution for manufacturers, surprisingly, might be to act more like other big tech companies chasing climate goals. From a report: New semiconductor factories being built in the US by four of the biggest manufacturers -- Intel, TSMC, Samsung, and Micron -- could use more than twice as much electricity as the city of Seattle once they&#x27;re operational. These companies claim to run on renewable energy, but according to an analysis by nonprofit Stand.earth, that&#x27;s not entirely true. Semiconductors happen to make up a big chunk of a device&#x27;s carbon footprint. And unless companies turn to clean energy, they could wind up driving up greenhouse gas emissions as domestic chip manufacturing makes a comeback. 

The CHIPS and Science Act, which passed in 2022, set aside $52.7 billion in funding for domestic chip manufacturing. Now, the four companies scrutinized in the report have plans to build megafactories in Arizona, Ohio, Oregon, Idaho, Texas, and New York. Each of those megafactories alone could use as much electricity as a medium-sized town, according to the report. Cumulatively, nine facilities could eventually add 2.1 gigawatts in new electricity demand. &quot;We&#x27;re not slowing down on any of our sustainability commitments, even with our recently announced investments,&quot; Intel said in an email.

However, the cybercriminal who claims to have given BlackCat access to Change&#x27;s network says the crime gang cheated them out of their share of the ransom, and that they still have the sensitive data Change reportedly paid the group to destroy.

                              <span>Warner Bros. Discovery said a password crackdown for its Max streaming service is coming later this year, joining competitors Netflix and Disney. TheWrap reports: JB Perrette, WBD&#x27;s CEO and president of global streaming and games, said the initiative would launch later this year with a broader rollout in 2025. &quot;We think, relative to the scale of our business, it&#x27;s a meaningful opportunity,&quot; Perrette said during Morgan Stanley&#x27;s 2024 Technology, Media &amp; Telecom Conference in San Francisco on Monday. The push to crack down on password sharing comes as Warner Bros. Discovery narrowed its streaming loss to $55 million during its fourth quarter of 2023, down from a loss of $217 million a year ago. For the full year, it swung to a profit of $103 million, compared to a loss of $1.59 billion in 2022.
 
Looking ahead, WBD said its DTC business would have &quot;modestly negative&quot; EBITDA in the first half of 2024 before turning profitable in the second half. WBD is targeting $1 billion of direct-to-consumer EBITDA in 2025. In its fourth quarter, Warner Bros. Discovery added 1.8 million subscribers in its direct-to-consumer division for a total of 97.7 million. The DTC segment&#x27;s results include Max, Discovery+ and traditional HBO cable subscriptions. Parrette also discussed interest in transactional ads, notes Ars Technica. Per Perrette: &quot;On the ad format size, we&#x27;ve made lots of improvements from where we were, but we still have a lot of ad format enhancements that will give us more things that we can go to marketers with, [like] shoppable ads [and] other elements of the ad format side of the house that we can improve.&quot;

                              <span>When pair programming, it&#x27;s important to rotate the pairs frequently, 
       but many organizations that do pair programming are reluctant to do that.
       Gabriel Robaina and Kieran Murphy ask
       the question: “What if we rotate pairs every day?” and worked with three
       teams through an exercise of daily pair rotation. They developed a
       lightweight methodology to help teams reflect on the benefits and
       challenges of pairing and how to solve them. Initial fears were overcome
       and teams discovered the benefits of frequently rotating pairs. They
       learned that pair swapping frequently greatly enhances the benefits of
       pairing. Their article shares the methodology they
       developed, their observations, and some common fears and insights shared
       by the participating team members.

                              <span>Richard Speed reports via The Register: Copilot in Windows is set to get even more assertive after Microsoft added a function that makes the AI assistant&#x27;s window pop up after a user&#x27;s cursor hovers over the icon in the task bar. [...] Windows Insiders on the Beta Channel â&quot; with the option to get the latest updates turned on â&quot; will soon find themselves on the receiving end of what Microsoft calls &quot;a new hover experience for Copilot in Windows&quot; from build 22635.3276.
 
If your mouse cursor happens to drift over to the Copilot icon on the taskbar, the Copilot pane will open to make users aware of the delights on offer. The result, we suspect, will be to educate users in the art of switching off the function. Much like Widgets, which will also make its unwanted presence felt should a user move a mouse over its icon. A swift hop into taskbar settings is all it takes to make the icons disappear, for now at least. The new feature is being piloted but considering the proximity of the Beta Channel to Release Preview, there is every chance the pop-up will, er, pop up in a release version of Windows before long.

Apple is making several of these changes to comply with the EU&#x27;s Digital Markets Act (DMA), a law that aims to make the digital economy fairer by removing unfair advantages that tech giants hold over businesses and end users. iOS 17.4 will allow third-party developers to offer alternative app marketplaces and app downloads to EU users from outside the iOS App Store. Developers wanting to take advantage of this will be required to go through Apple&#x27;s approval process and pay Apple a &quot;Core Technology Fee&quot; that charges 50 euro cents per …</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Oregon has joined the small but growing list of states that have passed right-to-repair legislation. Oregon&#x27;s bill stands out for a provision that would prevent companies from requiring that official parts be unlocked with encrypted software checks before they will fully function. Bill SB 1596 passed Oregon&#x27;s House by a 42 to 13 margin. Gov. Tina Kotek has five days to sign the bill into law. Consumer groups and right-to-repair advocates praised the bill as &quot;the best bill yet,&quot; while the bill&#x27;s chief sponsor, state Sen. Janeen Sollman (D), pointed to potential waste reductions and an improved second-hand market for closing a digital divide.

                              <span>The loss of Arctic sea ice has long been a graphic measure of human-caused climate change, with wrenching images of suffering polar bears illustrating a worsening planetary crisis. Now, new research has found that Arctic Ocean sea ice is shrinking even faster than previously thought -- and that the Arctic may start to see its first &quot;ice-free&quot; days within the current decade. From a report: That troubling milestone could occur before the end of the decade or sometime in the 2030s -- as many as 10 years earlier than previous projections, according to a study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Reviews Earth and Environment. The study defines &quot;ice-free&quot; as when the Arctic Ocean has less than 1 million square kilometers, or 386,000 square miles, of ice. 

By midcentury -- 2035 to 2067 -- the Arctic could see consistent ice-free conditions in September, the month when sea ice concentrations are typically at their minimum, the study found. The precise timing of such losses depends on how soon humanity is able to reduce fossil fuel emissions that are contributing to global warming. Under a high-emission scenario in which fossil fuel use continues unabated, the Arctic would be ice-free between the months of May and January by 2100, the study says. Even under a low-emission scenario, the Arctic would still be ice-free between August and October by that same year.

                              <span>The SAT, a college admissions exam that for nearly a century was completed using paper and pencil, is now officially all-digital. From a report: This week, students in the U.S. will begin taking the new SAT on their own devices -- including a tablet or a laptop -- or on school devices. The test is also one hour shorter (down from three hours), has shorter reading passages and uses digital tools, like a highlighter, a graphing calculator and a bookmark to go back to skipped questions. The revamped test, which ditches the paper and pencil, aims to make cheating harder and grading easier. 

Students will still take the exam at a test center or at a high school. &quot;Today&#x27;s students, they do a lot of their living digitally, they do a lot of their learning digitally and they do a lot of their test taking digitally,&quot; says Priscilla Rodriguez, who oversees the SAT for the College Board, the organization behind the test. Throughout March and April, the College Board expects more than 1 million students to take the new digital SAT. Students can take the exam on Saturday test dates or during SAT School Days, where participating high schools offer the test to upperclassmen free of charge during the school day.

                              <span>Amazon&#x27;s cloud services division is halting fees it has long charged customers that switch to a rival provider -- following in the steps of Google, which recently announced it was ending the practice. From a report: Amazon Web Services will no longer charge customers who want to extract all of their data from the company&#x27;s servers and move them to another service, AWS Vice President Robert Kennedy said in a blog post on Tuesday. &quot;Beginning today, customers globally are now entitled to free data transfers out to the internet if they want to move to another IT provider,&quot; Kennedy said.

                              <span>Microsoft is ending support for its Android subsystem in Windows 11 next year. From a report: The software giant first announced it was bringing Android apps to Windows 11 with Amazon&#x27;s Appstore nearly three years ago, but this Windows Subsystem for Android will now be deprecated starting March 5th, 2025. &quot;Microsoft is ending support for the Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA),&quot; reads a new support document from Microsoft. &quot;As a result, the Amazon Appstore on Windows and all applications and games dependent on WSA will no longer be supported beginning March 5, 2025.&quot; 

If you currently use Android apps from the Amazon Appstore, then you&#x27;ll continue to have access to these past the support cutoff date, but you won&#x27;t be able to download any new ones once Microsoft makes its Android subsystem end of life next year. On March 6th (tomorrow), Windows 11 users will no longer be able to search for Amazon Appstore or associated Android apps from the Microsoft Store.

                              <span>Microsoft has filed a motion seeking to dismiss key parts of a lawsuit The New York Times filed against the company and Open AI, accusing them of copyright infringement. From a report: If you&#x27;ll recall, The Times sued both companies for using its published articles to train their GPT large language models (LLMs) without permission and compensation. In its filing, the company has accused The Times of pushing &quot;doomsday futurology&quot; by claiming that AI technologies pose a threat to independent journalism. It follows OpenAI&#x27;s court filing from late February that&#x27;s also seeking to dismiss some important elements on the case. 

Like OpenAI before it, Microsoft accused The Times of crafting &quot;unrealistic prompts&quot; in an effort to &quot;coax the GPT-based tools&quot; to spit out responses matching its content. It also compared the media organization&#x27;s lawsuit to Hollywood studios&#x27; efforts to &quot; stop a groundbreaking new technology:&quot; The VCR. Instead of destroying Hollywood, Microsoft explained, the VCR helped the entertainment industry flourish by opening up revenue streams. LLMs are a breakthrough in artificial intelligence, it continued, and Microsoft collaborated with OpenAI to &quot;help bring their extraordinary power to the public&quot; because it &quot;firmly believes in LLMs&#x27; capacity to improve the way people live and work.&quot;

                              <span>The U.S. government announced Tuesday sanctions against the founder of the notorious spyware company Intellexa and one of his business partners. From a report: This is the first time the U.S. government has targeted specific people, in addition to companies, with sanctions related to the misuse of commercial spyware. And it signifies an escalation of the White House and U.S. government&#x27;s efforts to curb the spyware industry. &quot;Today&#x27;s actions represent a tangible step forward in discouraging the misuse of commercial surveillance tools, which increasingly present a security risk to the United States and our citizens,&quot; said Brian E. Nelson, U.S Treasury&#x27;s under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, was quoted as saying in a press release. 

&quot;The United States remains focused on establishing clear guardrails for the responsible development and use of these technologies while also ensuring the protection of human rights and civil liberties of individuals around the world.&quot; The U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on Tal Dilian, the founder of Intellexa and a veteran of the spyware industry; and Sara Aleksandra Fayssal Hamou, who is not as well-known as Dilian. Hamou, according to the Treasury, has a leadership role in Intellexa, is an expert in off-shoring, and provided the company managerial services, such as renting office space in Greece.

                              <span>Bitcoin surged to a record as demand from new US exchange-traded funds and a looming reduction in the token&#x27;s supply growth fuel a breathtaking rebound in the original cryptocurrency. From a report: The largest digital asset rose as much as 2.5% to $69,191.95 as of 10:10 a.m. Tuesday in New York. Bitcoin has climbed about 62% so far in 2024, outperforming global stocks and spreading optimism across the digital-asset market. 

In an ironic twist, Bitcoin owes much of its resurgence to a regulator long-viewed as hostile to crypto: the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC approved spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in early January after suffering a legal defeat last year in its attempt to reject them. The move has widened the mass-market accessibility of Bitcoin, helping the crypto sector to turn the page following a bear market in 2022 and a string of subsequent bankruptcies, including the implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried&#x27;s FTX exchange.

From a report: Even after Microsoft patched the vulnerability last month, the company made no mention that the North Korean threat group Lazarus had been using the vulnerability since at least August to install a stealthy rootkit on vulnerable computers. The vulnerability provided an easy and stealthy means for malware that had already gained administrative system rights to interact with the Windows kernel.

                              <span>&quot;Linux gained from 3% to 4% in 8 months,&quot; writes longtime Slashdot reader bobdevine. Linuxiac reports: According to the latest data from StatCounter, a leading web traffic analysis tool, Linux&#x27;s market share has reached 4.03%. At first glance, the number might seem modest, but it represents a significant leap. Let&#x27;s break it down. It took Linux 30 years to secure a 3% share of desktop operating systems, a milestone reached last June. Impressively, the open-source operating system has surged by an additional 1% in the last eight months.

                              <span>During Ballmer&#x27;s reign as CEO of Microsoft, the company always made plenty of money. While the stock traded sideways, Ballmer made sure it was still raining dividends. Yet, today, that era of Microsoft is not looked upon too fondly. It&#x27;s seen as being anchored in the company&#x27;s historic paranoia, Windows-centric world view, and as missing the boat on mobile.
 Then along came Satya Nadella. 
Now, it&#x27;s tempting to write a hagiography of whoever is CEO when a company is flying high, and Microsoft has soared in recent years. It&#x27;s currently the most valuable company in the world. The only one with an over three trillion dollar market capitalization. But we don&#x27;t need to be blinded by the halo effect to realize that Microsoft under Nadella is a fundamentally different company to the one it was un…</span>

                              <span>When we gradually replace a legacy system, we have plenty of cases
       where the legacy system and its replacement need to interact. Since these
       legacy systems are often difficult, and costly, to change, we need a
       mechanism that can integrate elements of the replacement while minimizing
       the impact to the legacy system. Ian Cartwright, Rob Horn, and
       James Lewis explain how we can use Event Interception on
       state-changing events, allowing us to forward them to the
       replacement.

                              <span>According to the San Francisco police department, police have made the first arrest in relation to several recent vehicle arsons, including the crowd attack of a Waymo robotaxi last month in Chinatown. The San Francisco Standard reports: Police say officers arrested a man meeting the description of a person suspected of lighting several vehicles on fire. That man was arrested on Feb. 27 near Union Square. The department did not share the suspect&#x27;s name because it said the case is open and remains under investigation. Nor did the department comment on which other vehicle fires the suspect may have been suspected of starting. Several Teslas were set alight in the weeks after the Waymo arson. The suspect was also found to have had methamphetamine on them.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Jack Teixeira, the National Guard airman who leaked confidential military documents on Discord, agreed Monday to plead guilty, promising to cooperate with officials attempting to trace the full extent of government secrets leaked. Under the plea deal, Teixeira will serve a much-reduced sentence, The Boston Globe reported, recommended between 11 years and 16 years and eight months. Previously, Teixeira had pleaded not guilty to six counts of &quot;willful retention and transmission of national defense information,&quot; potentially facing up to 10 years per count. During a pretrial hearing, prosecutors suggested he could face up to 25 years, The Globe reported.
 
By taking the deal, Teixeira will also avoid being charged with violations of the Espionage Act, The New York Times reported, including allegations of unlawful gathering and unauthorized removal of top-secret military documents. According to prosecutors, it was clear that Teixeira, 22, was leaking sensitive documents -- including national security secrets tied to US foreign adversaries and allies, including Russia, China, Ukraine, and South Korea -- just to impress his friends on Discord -- some of them teenage boys. Investigators found no evidence of espionage. US District Judge Indira Talwani will decide whether or not to sign off on the deal at a hearing scheduled for September 27.

                              <span>ZipK writes: Cord Cutters New reports that Roku has rolled out new terms of service that require users to accept individual arbitration. To gain acceptance, Roku devices pop up a dialog box that can only be dismissed if you accept the new terms or turn off your Roku and stop using it. As expected, much discussion has ensued in the Roku community.
 
Per the Roku Dispute Resolution Terms, users can opt out within 30 days of being subject to the new terms by sending a surface mail request to General Counsel, Roku Inc., 1701 Junction Court, Suite 100, San Jose, CA 95112. One poster in the community forum noted that the effective date of the change was Feb 20th, which may shorten the 30 day period for opting out. Longtime Slashdot reader blastard also shared the news.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Liliputing: Yuzu is a free and open source emulator that makes it possible to run Nintendo Switch games on Windows, Linux, and Android devices. First released in 2018, the software has been under constant development since then (the Android port was released less than a year ago). But last week Nintendo sued the developers, claiming that the primary purpose of the software is to circumvent Nintendo Switch encryption and allow users to play pirated games. Rather than fight the case in court, Tropic Haze (the developers behind Yuzu) have agreed to a settlement which involves paying $2.4 million in damages to Nintendo and basically shutting down Yuzu.
 
As part of a permanent injunction, Tropic Haze has agreed to stop distributing, advertising, or promoting Yuzu or any of its source code or features or any other &quot;software or devices that circumvent Nintendo&#x27;s technical protection measures.&quot; The court is also ordering the developers to turn over the yuzu-emu.org website to Nintendo and bars them &quot;from supporting or facilitating access&quot; to any other related websites, social media, chatrooms, or apps. In one of the more bizarre parts of the court order, the Yuzu team is told to delete all &quot;circumvention devices,&quot; which includes any tools used for development of Yuzu and &quot;all copies of Yuzu.&quot;

                              <span>Gartner: By 2026, traditional search engine volume will drop 25%, with search marketing losing market share to AI chatbots and other virtual agents, according to Gartner. &quot;Organic and paid search are vital channels for tech marketers seeking to reach awareness and demand generation goals,&quot; said Alan Antin, Vice President Analyst at Gartner. &quot;Generative AI (GenAI) solutions are becoming substitute answer engines, replacing user queries that previously may have been executed in traditional search engines. This will force companies to rethink their marketing channels strategy as GenAI becomes more embedded across all aspects of the enterprise.&quot; 

With GenAI driving down the cost of producing content, there is an impact around activities including keyword strategy and website domain authority scoring. Search engine algorithms will further value the quality of content to offset the sheer amount of AI-generated content, as content utility and quality still reigns supreme for success in organic search results. There will also be a greater emphasis placed on watermarking and other means to authenticate high-value content. Government regulations across the globe are already holding companies accountable as they begin to require the identification of marketing content assets that AI creates. This will likely play a role in how search engines will display such digital content.

                              <span>Anthropic, a leading artificial intelligence startup, unveiled its Claude 3 series of AI models today, designed to meet the diverse needs of enterprise customers with a balance of intelligence, speed, and cost efficiency. The lineup includes three models: Opus, Sonnet, and the upcoming Haiku. From a report: The star of the lineup is Opus, which Anthropic claims is more capable than any other openly available AI system on the market, even outperforming leading models from rivals OpenAI and Google. &quot;Opus is capable of the widest range of tasks and performs them exceptionally well,&quot; said Anthropic cofounder and CEO Dario Amodei in an interview with VentureBeat. Amodei explained that Opus outperforms top AI models like GPT-4, GPT-3.5 and Gemini Ultra on a wide range of benchmarks. This includes topping the leaderboard on academic benchmarks like GSM-8k for mathematical reasoning and MMLU for expert-level knowledge. 

&quot;It seems to outperform everyone and get scores that we haven&#x27;t seen before on some tasks,&quot; Amodei said. While companies like Anthropic and Google have not disclosed the full parameters of their leading models, the reported benchmark results from both companies imply Opus either matches or surpasses major alternatives like GPT-4 and Gemini in core capabilities. This, at least on paper, establishes a new high watermark for commercially available conversational AI. Engineered for complex tasks requiring advanced reasoning, Opus stands out in Anthropic&#x27;s lineup for its superior performance. Sonnet, the mid-range model, offers businesses a more cost-effective solution for routine data analysis and knowledge work, maintaining high performance without the premium price tag of the flagship model. Meanwhile, Haiku is designed to be swift and economical, suited for applications such as consumer-facing chatbots, where responsiveness and cost are crucial factors. Amodei told VentureBeat he expects Haiku to launch publicly in a matter of &quot;weeks, not months.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: India has waded into global AI debate by issuing an advisory that requires &quot;significant&quot; tech firms to get government permission before launching new models. India&#x27;s Ministry of Electronics and IT issued the advisory to firms on Friday. The advisory -- not published on public domain but a copy of which TechCrunch has reviewed -- also asks tech firms to ensure that their services or products &quot;do not permit any bias or discrimination or threaten the integrity of the electoral process.&quot; 

Though the ministry admits the advisory is not legally binding, India&#x27;s IT Deputy Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar says the notice is &quot;signalling that this is the future of regulation.&quot; He adds: &quot;We are doing it as an advisory today asking you to comply with it.&quot; In a tweet Monday, Chandrasekhar said the advisory is aimed at &quot;untested AI platforms deploying on the India internet&quot; and doesn&#x27;t apply to startups.

                              <span>JetBlue Airways and Spirit Airlines announced on Monday that they would walk away from their planned $3.8 billion merger after federal antitrust regulators successfully challenged the deal in court. JetBlue said it would pay Spirit $69 million to exit the deal. From a report: A federal judge in Boston blocked the proposed merger on Jan. 16, siding with the Justice Department in determining that the merger would reduce competition in the industry and give airlines more leeway to raise ticket prices. The judge, William G. Young of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, noted that Spirit played a vital role in the market as a low-cost carrier and that travelers would have fewer options if JetBlue absorbed it. 

&quot;We are proud of the work we did with Spirit to lay out a vision to challenge the status quo, but given the hurdles to closing that remain, we decided together that both airlines&#x27; interests are better served by moving forward independently,&quot; JetBlue&#x27;s chief executive, Joanna Geraghty, said in a statement on Monday. &quot;We wish the very best going forward to the entire Spirit team.&quot; JetBlue and Spirit appealed Judge Young&#x27;s decision. JetBlue filed an appellate brief last week arguing that the deal should be allowed to go through. But in a regulatory filing on Jan. 26, JetBlue said it might terminate the deal. Spirit said in its own filing the same day that it believed &quot;there is no basis for terminating&quot; the agreement.

                              <span>The EU Commission on Monday fined Apple about $2 billion for stifling competition from rival music streaming services. In a blog post, Spotify writes:
 Apple&#x27;s rules muzzled Spotify and other music streaming services from sharing with our users directly in our app about various benefits -- denying us the ability to communicate with them about how to upgrade and the price of subscriptions, promotions, discounts, or numerous other perks. Of course, Apple Music, a competitor to these apps, is not barred from the same behaviour. By requiring Apple to stop its illegal conduct in the EU, the EC is putting consumers first. It is a basic concept of free markets -- customers should know what options they have, and customers, not Apple, should decide what to buy, and where, when and how. 

While we appreciate the EC addressing this important case, we also know that the details matter. Apple has routinely defied laws and court decisions in other markets. So we&#x27;re looking forward to the next steps that will hopefully clearly and conclusively address Apple&#x27;s long-standing unfair practices. 

From the beginning, the foundational belief of the internet is that it should be a fair and open ecosystem. That belief has fueled growth, innovation and discovery around the world. Today the leading way people access the internet is via their mobile phones. So why should the same principles not apply? And while we are pleased that this case delivers some justice, it does not solve Apple&#x27;s bad behaviour towards developers beyond music streaming in other markets around the world. Our work will not be done until we succeed in securing a truly fair digital marketplace everywhere and our commitment to helping to make this a reality remains unwavering.

                              <span>&quot;It never occurred to me that having no visual imagery was unusual...&quot; writes a science journalist at the Guardian. 

&quot;It&#x27;s not that I forget what I look like, but I am sometimes a little surprised, and don&#x27;t feel connected to my outward appearance as a matter of identity.&quot;

There&#x27;s been a surge of research on how aphantasia affects our lives... [F]or some it affects images alone; some can&#x27;t imagine other sensory information, like sounds. Some people with aphantasia have visualizations when they dream (I do), and others don&#x27;t. There&#x27;s evidence that it can make it harder for people to recall visual details, though other studies show that aphants perform better on some memory tests unrelated to imagery... But overall, people with aphantasia don&#x27;t seem to have serious problems navigating their day-to-day lives, unlike those with more severe memory conditions like episodic amnesia... 

Some people consider aphantasia to be a deficit and wish they could reverse it. People have claimed they can train their way out of aphantasia, or use psychedelics to regain some sense of mental imagery (the jury is out on whether that works). I have no desire for this — my mind is plenty busy without a stream of imagery. If I was born with imagery, it would be commonplace for me, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d enjoy it. But I already can find myself overwhelmed with thoughts and feelings that have no visual aspects to them. 

Long-time Slashdot reader whoever57 writes that &quot;Personally, I never realized before reading this article that people could create mental images.&quot; (And they also wonder if people with the condition tend to go into STEM fields.) There&#x27;s what&#x27;s known as the &quot;red apple test,&quot; where you rate your own ability to visualize an apple on a scale of 1 to 5.

                              <span>A homeless man &quot;was taken into custody on suspicion of grand theft auto,&quot; reports the Los Angeles Times, &quot;after police said he tried to steal a Waymo self-driving car in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday night.&quot;


The man entered and tried to operate a Waymo vehicle that had stopped to let out a passenger at the corner of 1st and Main at 10:30 p.m., Los Angeles Police Department detective Meghan Aguilar said. After the man, whom a Waymo spokesman described as an &quot;unauthorized pedestrian,&quot; entered the vehicle, the company&#x27;s Rider Support team instructed him to exit the car. When he did not, the company contacted the police, &quot;who were then able to remove and arrest&quot; the man, said Chris Bonelli, a Waymo spokesman... 

No injuries were reported by the rider, and there was no damage to the vehicle, Bonelli said. The car was stationary during the entire incident because an unauthorized person was identified by the company to be in the vehicle, according to Waymo.

                              <span>In 1970 an Oregon man discovered a body with &quot;clear signs of foul play&quot;. 

NPR reports that &quot;The identity of the young woman remained a mystery — until Thursday.&quot;


State authorities identified the woman as Sandra Young, a teenager from Portland who went missing between 1968 and 1969. Her identity was discovered through advanced DNA technology, which has helped solve stubborn cold cases in recent years. The case&#x27;s breakthrough came last year in January, when a person uploaded their DNA to the genealogy database GEDMatch and the tool immediately determined that the DNA donor was a distant family member of Young.... 

From there, a genetic genealogist working with local law enforcement helped track down other possible relatives and encouraged them to provide their DNA. That work eventually led to Young&#x27;s sister and other family members, who confirmed that Young went missing around the same time. 

Thanks to Slashdot reader Tony Isaac for sharing the news.

 His journey was marked by challenges: from the nuances of remote work to the struggle of influencing company culture, and a critical incident that put his principles to the test against the company’s push for speed.
 Chris’s story highlights the tension between the need for innovation and the importance of project health. This all led Chris to a pivotal decision: to stay and compromise his beliefs or to leave in pursuit of work that aligned with his principles.
 He chose the latter. Join us as we dive into Chris’s compelling story, exploring the challenges of advocating for principled engineering in a world that often prioritizes quick wins over long-term value.

                              <span>Taiwan doesn&#x27;t have parking meters, writes long-time Slashdot reader Badlands, &quot;but rather roving armies of maids on electric scooters that cruise their area with their smartphone and take a pic of your license plate and timestamp it, leaving a receipt under your windshield wipers.&quot; 

But now one city will try &quot;smart parking&quot; services — which will also help drivers find vacant parking spots, according to Taiwan News:

The service will utilize 3,471 geomagnetic sensors installed along 122 stretches of roadway in Banqiao, Yonghe, Zhonghe and Xindian Districts, according to a press release. The sensors will be linked to a publicly available online database to indicate where open parking spaces are available. 


The &quot;New Taipei Street Parking Inquiry Service&quot; will be accessible through a main website run by the Department of Transportation. The service is also linked to two smartphone applications... Payments can be made automatically by linking one&#x27;s app profile to their smartphone&#x27;s telecommunications provider... For drivers that use spaces without linking their phone and vehicle to the smart network, cameras located along the street where the sensors are installed will allow the city to identify and bill drivers via mail, based on their vehicle&#x27;s registration information.

                              <span>&quot;NASA said Friday it is shutting down a $2 billion satellite refueling project,&quot; reports UPI, &quot;after criticizing the project&#x27;s contractor for poor performance.&quot;

The agency in a statement said it will discontinue the On-orbit Servicing, Assembly and Manufacturing 1 project after nearly a decade of work due to &quot;continued technical, cost, and schedule challenges, and a broader community evolution away from refueling unprepared spacecraft, which has led to a lack of a committed partner.&quot; [...] The spacecraft would have utilized an attached Space Infrastructure Dexterous Robot (SPIDER) to refuel the Landsat, assemble a communications antenna and demonstrate in-space manufacture of a 32-foot carbon fiber composite beam to verify the capability of constructing large spacecraft structures in orbit... An audit from NASA&#x27;s Inspector General, however, found OSAM-1 was on track to exceed the projected $2.05 billion budget and would not make its December 2026 launch date, laying the blame on the &quot;poor performance of Maxar.&quot; 

&quot;NASA and Maxar officials acknowledged that Maxar underestimated the scope and complexity of the work, lacked full understanding of NASA technical requirements, and were deficient in necessary expertise,&quot; the report read. 

The report also noted Maxar was &quot;no longer profiting from their work on OSAM-1,&quot; after which the xproject appeared not &quot;to be a high priority for Maxar in terms of the quality of its staffing.&quot;

[I]n a demonstration of the risks of connected, autonomous AI ecosystems, a group of researchers has created one of what they claim are the first generative AI worms — which can spread from one system to another, potentially stealing data or deploying malware in the process. &quot;It basically means that now you have the ability to conduct or to perform a new kind of cyberattack that hasn&#x27;t been seen before,&quot; says Ben Nassi, a Cornell Tech researcher behind the research. Nassi, along with fellow researchers Stav Cohen and Ron Bitton, created the worm, dubbed Morris II, as a nod to the original Morris computer worm that caused chaos across the Internet in 1988.

But is this part of a concerning trend?

Microsoft plans to absorb its excess heat with a steady flow of air and, as needed, evaporated drinking water. Use of the latter is projected to reach more than 50 million gallons every year. That might be a burden in the best of times. As of 2023, it seemed absurd. Phoenix had just endured its hottest summer ever, with 55 days of temperatures above 110 degrees. …</span>

ACM plans to open its entire archive of over 600,000 articles when its five-year transition to full Open Access is complete (January 2026 target date). 

&quot;They are right...&quot; the site&#x27;s editor-in-chief told Slashdot. &quot;We need to get Google to reindex the new site ASAP.&quot;

                              <span>Long-time Slashdot reader AmiMoJo quotes Tom&#x27;s Hardware: A Geekbench 6 result features what is likely the first-ever look at the single-core performance of the Taishan V120, developed by Huawei&#x27;s HiSilicon subsidiary (via @Olrak29_ on X). The single-core score indicates that Taishan V120 cores are roughly on par with AMD&#x27;s Zen 3 cores from late 2020, which could mean Huawei&#x27;s technology isn&#x27;t that far behind cutting-edge Western chip designers. 

The Taishan V120 core was first spotted in Huawei&#x27;s Kirin 9000s smartphone chip, which uses four of the cores alongside two efficiency-focused Arm Cortex A510 cores. Since Kirin 9000s chips are produced using SMIC&#x27;s second-generation 7nm node (which may make it illegal to sell internationally according to U.S. lawmakers), it would also seem likely that the Taishan V120 core tested in Geekbench 6 is also made on the second-generation 7nm node. The benchmark result doesn&#x27;t really say much about what the actual CPU is, with the only hint being &#x27;Huawei Cloud OpenStack Nova.&#x27; This implies it&#x27;s a Kunpeng server CPU, which may either be the Kunpeng 916, 920, or 930. While we can only guess which one it is, it&#x27;s almost certain to be the 930 given the high single-core performance shown in the result. By contrast, the few Geekbench 5 results for the Kunpeng 920 show it performing well behind AMD&#x27;s first-generation Epyc Naples from 2017.

                              <span>This week Linux Foundation Charities launched &quot;a groundbreaking open source software solution for real-time fraud prevention&quot; named Tazama — &quot;with support from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.&quot; 

They&#x27;re calling it &quot;the first-ever open source platform dedicated to enhancing fraud management in digital payments.&quot;

Until now, the financial industry has grappled with proprietary and often costly solutions that have limited access and adaptability for many, especially in developing economies. 

This challenge is underscored by the Global Anti-Scam Alliance, which reported that nearly $1 trillion was lost to online fraud in 2022. Tazama challenges this status quo by providing a powerful, scalable, and cost-effective alternative that democratizes access to advanced financial monitoring tools that can help combat fraud... The solution&#x27;s architecture emphasizes data sovereignty, privacy, and transparency, aligning with the priorities of governments worldwide. Hosted by LF Charities, which will support the operation and function of the project, Tazama showcases the scalability and robustness of open source solutions, particularly in critical infrastructure like national payment switches. 

Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation, described their reaction as &quot;excited to see an open source solution that not only enhances financial security but also provides a platform for our community to actively contribute to a project with broad societal impacts.&quot; 

And the announcement also includes a comment from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation&#x27;s deputy director for payment systems. &quot;This pioneering open source platform helps address critical challenges like fraud detection and compliance and paves the way for innovative, inclusive financial solutions that serve everyone, especially those in low-income countries. 

&quot;The launch of Tazama signifies another stride towards securing and democratizing digital financial services.&quot;

                              <span>&quot;These days in San Francisco, every major business closure triggers a rush to assign blame,&quot; argues the San Francisco Standard:


When Macy&#x27;s announced this week that it would shutter its flagship store in Union Square, it unleashed a wave of mourning and recriminations... Mayor London Breed and other local pols like state Sen. Scott Wiener tried to allay fears that Macy&#x27;s was leaving because of crime, noting the planned closure is one of 150 nationwide. But in a tough election year, it seems few had the appetite to listen to her call for nuance... 

The unavoidable truth is the pandemic hollowed out downtown San Francisco&#x27;s offices and led to an exodus of tech staffers who preferred remote work. It meant the loss of thousands of people who had reason to regularly stroll by Macy&#x27;s and so m…</span>

In terms of operating systems used by Rustaceans, the situation is very similar to the results from 2022, with Linux being the most popular choice of Rust users [69.7%], followed by macOS [33.5%] and Windows [31.9%], which have a very similar share of usage. Rust programmers target a diverse set of platforms with their Rust programs, even though the most popular target by far is still a Linux machine [85.4%]. We can see a slight uptick in users targeting WebAssembly [27.1%], embedded and mobile platforms, which speaks to the versatility of Rust.

                              <span>It completed the most precise landing ever on the moon — albeit upside-down. And then it faced a &quot;lunar night&quot; lasting about two weeks where temperatures drop to -270 degrees Fahrenheit, reports the Times of India. 

But then, &quot;Despite not being designed for the extreme temperatures, SLIM surprised scientists by coming back to life after the two-week-long lunar night.&quot;

More from Space.com:
The lander woke up on February 26 during extremely hot temperatures of 212 Fahrenheit (100 Celsius) in its region and has been making contact here and there with Earth in the days since. Most recently, SLIM attempted observations with its multiband spectroscopic camera, but &quot;it did not work properly,&quot; JAXA officials wrote. &quot;This seems to be due to the effects of overnight,&quot; the update continued, referring to the frigid two-week-long lunar night that SLIM experienced before the sun shone near Shioli crater again. &quot;But we will continue to investigate based on the data we have obtained for the next opportunity....&quot; 

&quot;We received so much support for our operations after the lunar night,&quot; the agency posted on social media — adding &quot;thank you!&quot; 

The Times of India reports that &quot;JAXA officially announced SLIM&#x27;s return to a dormant state on March 1, sharing an image of the lunar surface captured by the probe.&quot; 

Above the photo, JAXA posted this hopeful message. &quot;Although the probability of a failure increases with the repeated severe temperature cycles, SLIM operation will attempt to resume when the sun rises (late March). #GoodAfterMoon.&quot; 

And Space.com notes that &quot;Despite all, SLIM has met both main and extended mission objectives: Landing precisely on the moon, deploying two tiny rovers and conducting science with its navigation camera and its spectroscopic camera, particularly searching for signs of olivine on the surface.&quot;

                              <span>Some news from &quot;Copyleft Currents&quot;, the blog of open-source/IP lawyer Heather Meeker:

On February 14, 2024, the Court of Appeal of Paris issued an order stating that Orange, a major French telecom provider, had infringed the copyight of Entr&#x27;Ouvert&#x27;s Lasso software and violated the GPL. 

They ordered Orange to pay €500,000 in compensatory damages and €150,000 for moral damages. 

This case has been ongoing for many years. Entr&#x27;ouvert is the publisher of Lasso, a reference library for the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) protocol, an open standard for identity providers to authenticate users and pass authentication tokens to online services. This is the open protocol that enables single sign-on (SSO). The Lasso product is dual licensed by Entr&#x27;Ouvert under GPL or commercial licenses. 

In 2005, Orange won a contract with the French Agency for the Development of Electronic Administration to develop parts of the service-public.fr portal, which allows users to interact online with the government for administrative procedures. Orange used the Lasso software in the solution, but did not pass on the rights to its modifications free of charge under GPL, or make the source code to its modifications available. Entr&#x27;Ouvert sued Orange in 2010, and the case wended its way through the courts, turning on, among other things, issues of proof of Entr&#x27;Ouvert &#x27;s copyright interest in the software, and whether the case properly sounded in breach of contract or copyright infringement... 

The compensatory damages were based on both lost profits of the plaintiff and disgorgement of profits of Orange. Moral damages compensate the plaintiff for harm to reputation or other non-monetary injury.

                              <span>America&#x27;s Federal Aviation administration &quot;will require a fix for a new 737 MAX design problem discovered by Boeing that, although it&#x27;s a remote possibility, could theoretically disable the jet&#x27;s engine anti-ice system,&quot; reports the Seattle Times:

A different flaw in the MAX&#x27;s engine anti-ice system design drew scrutiny in January and forced the company to drop a request for an exemption from key safety regulations. And now, it&#x27;s not just the MAX with an engine anti-ice system problem. Airlines have reported a separate issue with a similar system on Boeing&#x27;s 787 Dreamliner that has caused what the FAA calls &quot;relatively minor&quot; damage to the engine inlets on some two dozen of these widebody jets in service. 

Though the FAA considers neither problem to be an immediate risk to flight safety,…</span>

                              <span>Strangely, a recent bathroom renovation crystalized my perspective on product development.
When being asked to choose between towel hooks or a towel bar, the choice was obvious: Hooks, of course.
Hooks take up no space. Towel bars suck up space.
Hooks hold towels no matter how you place them. Towel bars require towels to be balanced lest they slide off.
Towels naturally look good and drape well on hooks. Towels on bars require effort to display well.
Hooks can hold anything with a loop or a bend or a catch — loofas, shower caps, hats, rain soaked jackets and backpacks, etc. Towel bars can’t hold nearly as much, even though they take up much more space.
Hooks can hold multiple towels at once, with enough air getting to multiple layers because of the uneven ridges that single point hanging creates. Towel bars layer wet towels, leaving ones at the bottom or middle struggling to dry.
You can’t mount a hook crookedly. You can absolutely mount a towel bar unevenly.
Reasons go on.
But what do towel hooks have to do with product development? For me, just about everything. They’re a frame, they’re a lens, they’re aspirational. A hook holds more than towels — it holds lessons in how to build.
We aim to make hooks. I want our products full of hooks. Simple, flexible, you-can’t-do-it-wrong hooks. Hooks that just work, no fuss.
When working on new products, new features, and improving existing stuff, I’m visualizing the “hook-ness” of what we&#x27;re building. Making small, flexible features with minimal surface area that can be used intuitively in obvious ways without the possibility of doing it wrong. That’s the magic formula, that’s our model.
The unassuming, humble hook is a high bar.

                              <span>Space.com writes that NASA&#x27;s plan to return samples from Mars to the earth &quot;is facing major challenges, according to a new report. 

&quot;Design, cost and scheduling are all significant obstacles, an audit report of NASA&#x27;s Mars Sample Return (MSR) Program by the agency&#x27;s Office of Inspector General (OIG) finds...&quot;

It involves landing on Mars to collect samples taken by the Perseverance rover and launching those samples to rendezvous with an orbiter, which will haul them to Earth. Perseverance is already on Mars, snagging and storing samples. But the program still needs to build a Sample Retrieval Lander and an Earth Return Orbiter, the latter being developed and funded by the European Space Agency. The Mars Sample Return program is one of the most technically complex, operationally demanding and ambitious robotic science missions ever undertaken by NASA, according to the OIG report. 

The report notes design, architecture and schedule issues with the Capture Containment and Return System. These design issues resulted in adding about $200 million to the budget and one year of lost schedule... There is concern that, due to the number and significance of cost increase indicators so far, the $7.4 billion estimate is &quot;premature and may be insufficient,&quot; the report finds. Now, the complexity... could drive costs to between $8 billion to $11 billion, the OIG report notes, citing a September 2023 Independent Review Board report. Notably, a July 2020 estimate listed costs of $2.5 to $3 billion. 

These new figures indicate significant financial challenges and uncertainties... Issues include inflation, supply chain problems and increases in funding requests for specific program components.

                              <span>Americans filing their taxes could face privacy threats, reports the Washington Post:
&quot;We just need your OK on a couple of things,&quot; TurboTax says as you prepare your tax return. 

Alarm bells should be ringing in your head at the innocuous tone. 

This is where America&#x27;s most popular tax-prep website asks you to sign away the ironclad privacy protections of your tax return, including the details of your income, home mortgage and student loan payments. With your permission to blab your money secrets, the company earns extra income from showing you advertisements for the next three years for things like credit cards and mortgage offers targeted to your financial situation. 

You have the legal right to say no when TurboTax asks for your permission to &quot;share your data&quot; or use your tax information to &quot;improve your experience....&quot; 
The article complains that granting permission allows TurboTax to share details with &quot;sibling&quot; companies &quot;such as your salary, the amount of your tax refund, whether you received a tax break for student loans and the day you printed your tax return...&quot; 

&quot;You&#x27;ll see that permission request once near the beginning of the tax prep process. If you skip it then, you&#x27;ll see the same screen again near the end. You&#x27;ll have to say yes or no...&quot;
This is part of the corporate arms race for your personal data. Everyone including the grocery store, your apps and the manufacturer of your car are gobbling information to profit from details of your life. With TurboTax, though, you have the power to refuse to participate... 
TurboTax and the online tax prep service from H&amp;R Block have been asking every year to blab your tax return. We&#x27;ve cautioned you about it for each of the past two tax filing seasons. (I focused only on TurboTax this year.)

                              <span>You know how like-charged objects repel — and do so regardless of the sign of their electrical charge? Maybe not always, according to new research published in Nature. 

&quot;We demonstrate experimentally that the solvent plays a hitherto unforeseen but crucial role in interparticle interactions,&quot; they write. But more importantly, &quot;interactions in the fluid phase can break charge-reversal symmetry. 

 We show that in aqueous solution, negatively charged particles can attract at long range while positively charged particles repel. [In solvents like alcohols &quot;that exhibit an inversion of the net molecular dipole at an interface&quot;], positively charged particles may attract whereas negatives repel. 

The observations hold across a wide variety of surface chemistries: from inorganic silica and polymeric particles to polyelectrolyte- and polypeptide-coated surfaces in aqueous solution. 

A theory of interparticle interactions that invokes solvent structuring at an interface captures the observations. Our study establishes a nanoscopic interfacial mechanism by which solvent molecules may give rise to a strong and long-ranged force in solution, with immediate ramifications for a range of particulate and molecular processes across length scales such as self-assembly, gelation and crystallization, biomolecular condensation, coacervation, and phase segregation. 

The delicate interplay of interactions between objects in the fluid phase influences the behaviour, organization and properties of systems from nanometric to more macroscopic size and length scales and thus underpins a wealth of natural phenomena...

A YouTube contractor was addressing the Austin City Council on Thursday, calling on them to urge Google to negotiate with his union, when a colleague interrupted him with jaw-dropping news: His 43-person team of contractors had all been laid off... 

The YouTube workers, who work for Google and Cognizant, unanimously voted to unionize under the Alphabet Workers Union-CWA in April 2023. Since then, the workers say that Google has refused to bargain with them. Thursday&#x27;s layoff signifies continued tensions between Google and its workers, some of whom in 2021 formed a union... 

Workers had about 20 minutes to gather their belongings and leave the premises before they were considered trespassing.

                              <span>In 2005 Gabe Rivera was a compiler software engineer at Intel — before starting the tech-news aggregator Techmeme. And last year his Threads profile added the words &quot;This is a little self-serving, but I want all social networks to be as open as possible.&quot; 

Friday Threads engineer Jesse Chen posted that it was Rivera&#x27;s post when Threads launched asking for an API that &quot;convinced us to go for it.&quot; And Techmeme just made its first post using the API, according to Chen.
The Verge reports :

Threads plans to release its API by the end of June after testing it with a limited set of partners, including Hootsuite, Sprinklr, Sprout Social, Social News Desk, and Techmeme. The API will let developers build third-party apps for Threads and allow sites to publish directly to the platform. 


More from TechCrunch:

 Engineer Jesse Chen posted that the company has been building the API for the past few months. The API currently allows users to authenticate, publish threads and fetch the content they post through these tools. &quot;Over the past few months, we&#x27;ve been building the Threads API to enable creators, developers, and brands to manage their Threads presence at scale and easily share fresh, new ideas with their communities from their favorite third-party applications,&quot; he said... 

The engineer added that Threads is looking to add more capabilities to APIs for moderation and insights gathering.

&quot;The hackers stole data about patients, encrypted company files and demanded money to unlock them, prompting the company to shut down most of its network as it worked to recover.&quot;

Insurance giant UnitedHealthcare Group said the hackers struck its Change Health business unit, which routes prescription claims from pharmacies to companies that determine whether patients are covered by insurance and what they should pay... Change Health and a rival, CoverMyMeds, are the two biggest players in the so-called switch business, charging pharmacies a small fee for funneling claims to insurers. &quot;When one of them g…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from MacRumors: Spotify, Epic Games, Deezer, Paddle, and several other developers and EU associations today sent a joint letter to the European Commission to complain about Apple&#x27;s &quot;proposed scheme for compliance&quot; with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The 34 companies and associations do not believe Apple&#x27;s plans &quot;meet the law&#x27;s requirements.&quot; Apple&#x27;s changes &quot;disregard both the spirit and letter of the law&quot; and if left unchanged, will &quot;make a mockery of the DMA,&quot; according to the letter. Several specific components of Apple&#x27;s plan are highlighted, including the Core Technology Fee, the Notarization process, and the terms that developers must accept: 
- Apple&#x27;s requirement to stay with the current App Store terms or opt in to new terms provides developers with &quot;an unworkable choice&quot; that adds complexity and confusion. The letter suggests that neither option is DMA compliant and would &quot;consolidate Apple&#x27;s stronghold over digital markets.&quot;
- The Core Technology Fee and transaction fees will hamper competition and will prevent developers from agreeing to the &quot;unjust terms.&quot;
- Apple is using &quot;unfounded privacy and security concerns&quot; to limit user choice. The &quot;scare screens&quot; that Apple plans to show users will &quot;mislead and degrade the user experience.&quot;
- Apple is not allowing sideloading, and it is making the installation and use of new app stores &quot;difficult, risky and financially unattractive for developers.&quot; 
The companies and associations are urging the European Union to take &quot;swift, timely and decisive action against Apple.&quot; The way the European Commission responds to Apple&#x27;s proposal &quot;will serve as a litmus test of the DMA and whether it can deliver for Europe&#x27;s citizens and economy.&quot; Further reading: Apple Backtracks on Removing EU Home Screen Web Apps in iOS 17.4

                              <span>An upcoming April release of Copilot for OneDrive will be able to find, summarize, and extract information from a wide range of files, including text documents, presentations, spreadsheets, HTML pages and PDF files. &quot;Users can ask Copilot to tailor summaries to their liking, such as only including key points or highlights from a specific section,&quot; reports The Verge. From the report: The chatbot will also be able to respond to natural language prompts and answer highly specific questions about the contents of a user&#x27;s files. Some examples given by Microsoft included asking Copilot to tabulate a week&#x27;s worth of beverage sales and throw the data in a table view by day. Or, asking it to list the pros and cons of a project, or display the most recent or relevant files. Users can even ask Copilot for advice on how to make their documents better. Copilot on OneDrive will also be able to create outlines, tables, and lists for users, based on existing files. A few examples given were:
 
- Using the /sales-enablement.docx as reference, create an outline of a sales pitch to a new customer.

- For these selected resumes, create a table with names, current title, years of experience, educational qualifications, and current location.

- Create a list of frequently asked questions about project Moonshot.

                              <span>The desert planet Arrakis in Frank Herbert&#x27;s science fiction novel Dune is plausible, says Alexander Farnsworth, a climate modeler at the University of Bristol in England. According to Science News, the world would be a harsh place for humans to live, and they probably wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about getting eaten by extraterrestrial helminths. From the report: For their Arrakis climate simulation, which you can explore at the website Climate Archive, Farnsworth and colleagues started with the well-known physics that drive weather and climate on Earth. Using our planet as a starting point makes sense, Farnsworth says, partly because Herbert drew inspiration for Arrakis from &quot;some sort of semi-science of looking at dune systems on the Earth itself.&quot; The team then added nuggets of information a…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from CBS News: Scientists and researchers are celebrating what they call a &quot;dream&quot; discovery after an exploratory drill confirmed a high concentration of helium buried deep in Minnesota&#x27;s Iron Range. Thomas Abraham-James, CEO of Pulsar Helium, said the confirmed presence of helium could be one of the most significant such finds in the world. CBS News Minnesota toured the drill site soon after the drill rig first broke ground at the beginning of February. The discovery happened more than three weeks later at about 2 a.m. Thursday, as a drill reached its depth of 2,200 feet below the surface. According to Abraham-James, the helium concentration was measured at 12.4%, which is higher than forecasted and roughly 30 times the industry standard for commercial helium. &quot;12.4% is just a dream. It&#x27;s perfect,&quot; he said.
 
Now that helium is confirmed to be underground in Babbitt, Abraham-James said the next phase of the project is a feasibility study by an independent third party to study the size of the well and whether it could support a full-service helium plant. &quot;It&#x27;s not just about drilling one hole, but now proving up the geological models, being able to get some really good data that wasn&#x27;t captured in the original discovery,&quot; he explained. &quot;It has the potential to really contribute to local society.&quot; The company said the feasibility study could take until the end of the year to complete.

                              <span>Since implementing a remote-first policy in 2021, Yelp says it&#x27;s experienced a surge in job applications and a more satisfied workforce. Fortune reports: Last year, the total number of job applicants was 43% higher compared to 2021, according to Yelp&#x27;s 2024 Remote Work Report released earlier this month. The number of applicants for sales roles skyrocketed by 103%, and prospects for its general and administrative (G&amp;A) positions shot up 52% over the same time period. Those increases fall in line with data that shows a tidal wave of applicants clamoring for remote jobs. &quot;It&#x27;s rewarding to see both the level of interest and the quality of our applicants,&quot; Carmen Amara, chief people officer at Yelp, told Fortune. &quot;Remote work has allowed us to attract a number of candidates who previously would not have applied to Yelp due to their location.&quot;
 
Despite arguments that remote work weakens workers&#x27; connections and growth opportunities, Yelp says it has found the opposite to be true. About 90% of the company&#x27;s more than 4,700 employees say they have found effective ways to collaborate remotely, and 91% say they are confident in upward career mobility while working out of the office. Flexible schedules have also facilitated a healthy work-life balance -- about 89% of the company&#x27;s workers say they can manage personal and professional demands, and the same amount say that the remote model has allowed them to make positive changes for their wellbeing.
 
Notably, Yelp&#x27;s global tenure has increased to 3.5 years in 2023, compared to 2.8 years the year prior. The company says it&#x27;s using the money it saved from shutting down its underutilized offices in New York City, Chicago, and Washington D.C., to funnel back into employee benefits, professional development, and wellness reimbursements.

                              <span>Emma Roth reports via The Verge: If you still haven&#x27;t migrated your Oculus account to a Meta one, you might want to do that soon. In an email sent to users, the company says it will delete Oculus accounts on March 29th, 2024, preventing you from reactivating or retrieving your apps, in-app purchases, store credits, and more. You&#x27;ll lose your achievements, friends list, and any content created with your Oculus account if you don&#x27;t migrate to a Meta account before then.
 
Oculus accounts have been on the way out since 2020, when the company then known as Facebook started requiring new users to sign up with Facebook accounts instead. However, it added the ability to create a Meta account in 2022, offering an alternative to users who didn&#x27;t want to link their Facebook account to their Quest headset. Meta stopped letting users log in to their Oculus accounts in January 2023. If you&#x27;ve got a Quest gathering dust in a drawer somewhere, now&#x27;s your last chance to migrate your Oculus account to a Meta one.
 
You can migrate your account by heading to this page and signing up for a Meta account with the same email you&#x27;ve used for Oculus. From there, you&#x27;ll be able to access all of the same games, data, and other purchases saved to your Oculus account.

                              <span>The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) approved Alphabet&#x27;s Waymo robotaxi service to operate in Los Angeles and some cities near San Francisco. Reuters reports: Waymo, which already operates in San Francisco and Phoenix, applied on Jan 19 to expand its driverless services, saying it would work with policymakers, first responders and community organizations. Last month, the CPUC suspended the application &quot;for further staff review.&quot; &quot;Waymo may begin fared driverless passenger service operations in the specified areas of Los Angeles and the San Francisco Peninsula, effective today,&quot; the regulator said on a notice posted to its website Friday.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Gizmodo: For 20 years, a loosely organized group of Wikipedia editors toiled away curating a collection of 15,000 articles on a single subject: the roads and highways of the United States. Despite minor disagreements, the US Roads Project mostly worked in harmony, but recently, a long-simmering debate over the website&#x27;s rules drove this community to the brink. Efforts at compromise fell apart. There was a schism, and in the fall of 2023, the editors packed up their articles and moved over to a website dedicated to roads and roads alone. It&#x27;s called AARoads, a promised land where the editors hope, at last, that they can find peace. &quot;Roads are a background piece.

Most people don&#x27;t switch operating systems willy-nilly, and for good reason: They&#x27;re different! And different is weird at first! But I&#x27;m actually glad Apple gave me the final push to venture outside the walled garden for a longer stroll, because the expedition has been a delight.
 And now that Apple has done a complete 180 on PWAs in the EU – they&#x27;re not going anywhere, the company announced today – I&#x27;m even happier with the way it all worked out. Apple gave me an excellent reminder that having all your computing eggs in one basket leaves you mighty vulnerable to predatory behavior. Because what are you going to do? If you&#x27;re A…</span>

                              <span>Paul Kunert writes in an exclusive report for The Register: IBM is asking staff who want to take voluntary redundancy to raise their hand as it embarks on a new round of global job cuts, though roles in Europe and within a handful of departments are expected to shoulder the brunt. The Resource Action, as Big Blue likes to euphemistically refer to layoffs, shouldn&#x27;t be a massive surprise to anyone with more than a passing interest in IBM as it was signaled last month in a Q4 earnings call. Insiders told us this latest process is not considered to be financial but &quot;transformative,&quot; although IBM was quite clear in January when CFO James Kavanaugh discussed achieving &quot;$3 billion annual run rate in savings by the end of 2024.&quot; This is a third bigger than the initial ambition. The Reg understands that 80 percent of the reduction target is aimed at Enterprise Operations &amp; Support (EO&amp;S) and Q2C missions, Finance &amp; Operations (including Procurement, CIO, HR, Marketing &amp; Comms and Global Real Estate).
 
The European Works Council, one IBMer told us, has informed staff that circa 50 percent of IBM&#x27;s reduction goal will impact staffing levels across the European continent. As if often the preferred route, IBM is seeking employees that are happy to take voluntary redundancy, rather than ditching someone that doesn&#x27;t want to leave. The sources we spoke to did not reveal the total population in scope for redundancies or the numbers of volunteers being sought. IBM did not confirm the numbers either. [...] Slovakia, we&#x27;re told, is to feel the tightest squeeze with around a third of IBM&#x27;s cuts in Europe landing on its International (shared services) Center in Bratislava; the Center in Hungary that supports EO&amp;S/ Q2C, as well as the Finance function in Bulgaria are also going to absorb what our sources described as the most dramatic staff reductions.

                              <span>The Supreme Court of Canada ruled today that police must now have a warrant or court order to obtain a person or organization&#x27;s IP address. CBC News reports: The top court was asked to consider whether an IP address alone, without any of the personal information attached to it, was protected by an expectation of privacy under the Charter. In a five-four split decision, the court said a reasonable expectation of privacy is attached to the numbers making up a person&#x27;s IP address, and just getting those numbers alone constitutes a search. Writing for the majority, Justice Andromache Karakatsanis wrote that an IP address is &quot;the crucial link between an internet user and their online activity.&quot; &quot;Thus, the subject matter of this search was the information these IP addresses could reveal about sp…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: A technology company that routes millions of SMS text messages across the world has secured an exposed database that was spilling one-time security codes that may have granted users&#x27; access to their Facebook, Google and TikTok accounts. The Asian technology and internet company YX International manufactures cellular networking equipment and provides SMS text message routing services. SMS routing helps to get time-critical text messages to their proper destination across various regional cell networks and providers, such as a user receiving an SMS security code or link for logging in to online services. YX International claims to send 5 million SMS text messages daily. But the technology company left one of its internal databases exposed to the internet without a password, allowing anyone to access the sensitive data inside using only a web browser, just with knowledge of the database&#x27;s public IP address.
 
Anurag Sen, a good-faith security researcher and expert in discovering sensitive but inadvertently exposed datasets leaking to the internet, found the database. Sen said it was not apparent who the database belonged to, nor who to report the leak to, so Sen shared details of the exposed database with TechCrunch to help identify its owner and report the security lapse. Sen told TechCrunch that the exposed database included the contents of text messages sent to users, including one-time passcodes and password reset links for some of the world&#x27;s largest tech and online companies, including Facebook and WhatsApp, Google, TikTok, and others. The database had monthly logs dating back to July 2023 and was growing in size by the minute. In the exposed database, TechCrunch found sets of internal email addresses and corresponding passwords associated with YX International, and alerted the company to the spilling database. The database went offline a short time later.

                              <span>Rates of obesity in the U.S. and around the world have more than doubled over the past three decades, according to a new study in The Lancet. From a report: More than 1 billion people worldwide now have obesity, a sign of worsening nutrition that&#x27;s also raising the risk of leading causes of death and disease such as high blood pressure, cancer and diabetes. The global rate of obesity more than doubled among women, from 8.8% to 18.5%, and nearly tripled in men, from 4.8% to 14.0%, between 1990 and 2022, according to research that pulls from over 3,600 studies. 

The obesity rate among children and adolescents increased by roughly four times, from 1.7% to 6.9% in girls and 2.1% to 9.3% in boys. Just over 4 in 10 adults and 2 in 5 kids in the U.S. are obese. The U.S. now has the world&#x27;s 10th-highest male obesity rate and 36th-highest female obesity rate. In 1990, the U.S. had the world&#x27;s 17th-highest male obesity rate and the 41st-highest female obesity rate.

                              <span>Energy-related emissions of carbon dioxide hit a record high in 2023, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in a report on Friday. The IEA analysis showed that it rose by 410 million tonnes, or 1.1%, in 2023 to 37.4 billion tonnes. From a report: &quot;Far from falling rapidly -- as is required to meet the global climate goals set out in the Paris Agreement -- CO2 emissions reached a new record high,&quot; the IEA said. However, the Paris-based watchdog also found clean energy including wind and solar energy, as well as electric vehicles, had helped to offset the impact of the continued burning of coal and oil growth, which was 1.3% in 2022. 

The reopening of China&#x27;s economy after the COVID-19 pandemic and a recovery in the aviation sector contributed to an overall rise, the IEA said in its report. Severe droughts last year in China, the United States, India, and other countries hampered hydropower production. It accounted for around 40% of the rise in emissions or 170 million tonnes of CO2. &quot;Without this effect, emissions from the global electricity sector would have fallen in 2023,&quot; the IEA said. Carbon dioxide emissions from coal accounted for the remaining increase. The IEA analysis showed that 2023 was the first year in which at least half of electricity generation in industrialized countries came from low-emission sources such as renewable energy and nuclear power. Energy-related emissions in the United States fell by 4.1%, and 9% in the European Union, driven by a surge in renewable power generation.

Pitchbook: On the phone with a founder who recently wound down his seed-stage software startup, I asked him what his plan was next. Having laid off all of his employees in autumn of last year, he was the last man standing: tasked with the thankless job of shutting down the company, returning capital, and dealing with tax documents. To handle the bureaucracy, the founder used Sunset, one of the companies that sprung up last year to respond to the burgeoning industry of failed startups. 

In a sign of the times, such wind-down startups are growing rapidly. Sunset saw 9x quarter-over-quarter revenue growth and a 65% monthly customer growth rate between November 2023 and January 2024. Competitor …</span>

                              <span>Nikon is working with NASA to make a mirrorless camera that astronauts will use during the agency&#x27;s incoming Artemis III mission to document their return to the Moon. From a report: On Thursday, NASA announced that it had entered a Space Act agreement with Nikon to develop the Handheld Universal Lunar Camera (HULC), a camera system designed to capture imagery in low light and survive the harsh lunar environment. The crewed Artemis III mission -- which will launch &quot;no earlier than September 2026&quot; -- aims to explore the lunar south pole, a region of the Moon that contains water ice within permanently shadowed craters. 

That makes it an area of scientific interest, but the extreme lighting and temperature conditions pose particular technical challenges for operating equipment within the lunar south pole region. Nikon&#x27;s full-frame Z9 flagship has already been used in thermal, vacuum, and radiation testing before the agreement, with a modified version of the camera forming the base of the HULC system alongside Nikkor lenses. The HULC design also implements thermal blankets designed by NASA to protect the camera from dust and extreme temperatures and modified electrical components to minimize potential issues caused by radiation. A custom grip with modified buttons has been used to make it easier for suited crew members to operate the camera system while wearing gloves.

                              <span>Russian space officials have acknowledged a continuing air leak from the Russian segment of the International Space Station, but said it poses no danger to its crew. From a report: The Roscosmos state corporation said that specialists were monitoring the leak and the crew &quot;regularly conducts work to locate and fix possible spots of the leak.&quot; It said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies: &quot;There is no threat to the crew or the station itself.&quot; Joel Montalbano, Nasa&#x27;s station project manager, had noted on Wednesday that the leak in the Russian segment has increased but emphasised that it remained small and posed no threat to the crew&#x27;s safety or vehicle operations. 

As the space outpost is ageing, the crew has to spend more time to repair and maintain it, Roscosmos said. Russian space officials first reported a leak in the Zvezda module in August 2020 and later that year Russian crew members located what they believed was its source and tried to fix it. In November 2021, another potentially leaky spot was found in a different part of the Russian section of the station. Roscosmos and Nasa have said the leak posed no danger to the crew and did not affect operations on the station. There have been other glitches. In October, coolant leaked from an external backup radiator for Russia&#x27;s new science lab, Nauka, although its main thermal control system was working normally and space officials said the crew and the station were not in danger.

                              <span>Apple is reversing its previous decision to remove support for Home Screen web apps in iOS 17.4 for EU users. Apple&#x27;s statement: Previously, Apple announced plans to remove the Home Screen web apps capability in the EU as part of our efforts to comply with the DMA. The need to remove the capability was informed by the complex security and privacy concerns associated with web apps to support alternative browser engines that would require building a new integration architecture that does not currently exist in iOS. 

We have received requests to continue to offer support for Home Screen web apps in iOS, therefore we will continue to offer the existing Home Screen web apps capability in the EU. This support means Home Screen web apps continue to be built directly on WebKit and its security architecture, and align with the security and privacy model for native apps on iOS. 

Developers and users who may have been impacted by the removal of Home Screen web apps in the beta release of iOS in the EU can expect the return of the existing functionality for Home Screen web apps with the availability of iOS 17.4 in early March.

                              <span>HP launched a subscription service this week that rents people a printer, allots them a specific amount of printed pages, and sends them ink for a monthly fee. From a report: HP is framing its service as a way to simplify printing for families and small businesses, but the deal also comes with monitoring and a years-long commitment. Prices range from $6.99 per month for a plan that includes an HP Envy printer (the current model is the 6020e) and 20 printed pages. The priciest plan includes an HP OfficeJet Pro rental and 700 printed pages for $35.99 per month. 

HP says it will provide subscribers with ink deliveries when they&#x27;re running low and 24/7 support via phone or chat (although it&#x27;s dubious how much you want to rely on HP support). Support doesn&#x27;t include on or offsite repairs or part replacements. The subscription&#x27;s terms of service (TOS) note that the service doesn&#x27;t cover damage or failure caused by, unsurprisingly, &quot;use of non-HP media supplies and other products&quot; or if you use your printer more than what your plan calls for. HP calls this an All-In-Plan; if you subscribe, the tech company will be all in on your printing activities. One of the most perturbing aspects of the subscription plan is that it requires subscribers to keep their printers connected to the Internet. HP seeks two-year subscriber commitments, charging up to $270 plus taxes if canceled early.

                              <span>A number of government agencies in the European Union and elsewhere have voiced concerns about security risks as Apple opens up its iPhones and iPads to rival app stores to comply with EU tech rules, Apple said on Friday. From a report: Under the Digital Markets Act, from March 7 Apple will be required to offer alternative app stores on iPhones and allow developers to opt out of using its in-app payment system, which charges fees of up to 30%. The U.S. tech giant, which on Jan. 24 detailed the changes to bring its App Store in line with the EU rules, said &quot;sideloading&quot; has sparked concerns from both EU and non-EU government agencies and users.

                              <span>Google is cracking down on rooted Android devices, blocking multiple people from using the RCS message feature in Google Messages. From a report: Users with rooted phones -- a process that unlocks privileged access to the Android operating system, like jailbreaking iPhones -- have made several reports on the Google Messages support page, Reddit, and XDA&#x27;s web forum over the last few months, finding they&#x27;re suddenly unable to send or receive RCS messages. One example from Reddit user u/joefuf shows that RCS messages would simply vanish after hitting the send button. Several reports also mention that Google Messages gave no indication that RCS chat was no longer working, and was still showing as connected and working in Google Messages. In a statement sent to the Verge where we asked if Google is blocking rooted devices from using RCS, Google communications manager Ivy Hunt said the company is &quot;ensuring that message-issuing/receiving devices are following the operating measures defined by the RCS standard&quot; in a bid to prevent spam and abuse on Google Messages. In other words, yes, Google is blocking RCS on rooted devices.

                              <span>According to the Washington Post (paywalled), the FBI is using mobile push notification data to unmask people suspected of serious crimes, such as pedophilia, terrorism, and murder. Gizmodo reports: The Post did a little digging into court records and found evidence of at least 130 search warrants filed by the feds for push notification data in cases spanning 14 states. In those cases, FBI officials asked tech companies like Google, Apple, and Facebook to fork over data related to a suspect&#x27;s mobile notifications, then used the data to implicate the suspect in criminal behavior linked to a particular app, even though many of those apps were supposedly anonymous communication platforms, like Wickr.
 
How exactly is this possible? Push notifications, which are provided by a mobile operating system provider, include embedded metadata that can be examined to understand the use of the mobile apps on a particular phone. Apps come laced with a quiet identifier, a &quot;push token,&quot; which is stored on the corporate servers of a company like Apple or another phone manufacturer after a user signs up to use a particular app. Those tokens can later be used to identify the person using the app, based on the information associated with the device on which the app was downloaded. Even turning off push notifications on your device doesn&#x27;t necessarily disable this feature, experts contend. [...]
 
If finding new ways to catch pedophiles and terrorists doesn&#x27;t seem like the worst thing in the world, the Post article highlights the voices of critics who fear that this kind of mobile data could be used to track people who have not committed serious crimes -- like political activists or women seeking abortions in states where the procedure has been restricted.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Today is Leap Day, meaning that for the first time in four years, it&#x27;s February 29. That&#x27;s normally a quirky, astronomical factoid (or a very special birthday for some). But that unique calendar date broke gas station payment systems across New Zealand for much of the day. As reported by numerous international outlets, self-serve pumps in New Zealand were unable to accept card payments due to a problem with the gas pumps&#x27; payment processing software. The New Zealand Herald reported that the outage lasted &quot;more than 10 hours.&quot; This effectively shuttered some gas stations, while others had to rely on in-store payments. The outage affected suppliers, including Allied Petroleum, BP, Gull, Waitomo, and Z Energy, and has reportedly been fixed. In-house payment solutions, such as BP fuel cards and the Waitomo app, reportedly still worked during the outage. A representative for Petroleum, when prompted via Facebook to &quot;maybe remember Leap Day in four years&#x27; time,&quot; responded: &quot;We&#x27;ll add it to our Outlook reminders :(&quot;

                              <span>Starting today, Ford electric vehicle owners can use one of Tesla&#x27;s 2,400+ superchargers, but there&#x27;s a hitch. &quot;They&#x27;ll need to get an adapter that Ford will provide for free, although the company won&#x27;t start shipping those until the end of March,&quot; notes the Associated Press. Product Reviewer MKBHD also notes that non-Teslas will need to park in a spot that blocks 2 spots where a Tesla would take up one. &quot;If the charge station fills up the remaining spots with Teslas, the app will show 1 charger as available but the parking spot is blocked by the Mach-E,&quot; adds MKBHD. From the report: Last May, Ford became the first automaker to reach an agreement with the Austin, Texas-based Tesla to charge on its network, which is the largest and most well-placed in the U.S. Tesla has more than 26,000 plugs and nearly 2,400 Supercharger stations across the U.S. and Canada. Ford said its owners will have access to about 15,000 Tesla fast-charging plugs that are located strategically along travel corridors. Ford owners won&#x27;t be able to use some older Tesla plugs.
 
Most other automakers followed Ford in joining Tesla&#x27;s network and agreeing to switch to Tesla&#x27;s plug, called the North American Charging Standard, which is smaller and easier to use than the current plugs on most other EVs sold in the two countries. Ford said adding the Tesla plugs will double the size of the network that can be used by Ford EV owners. There are nearly 166,000 Ford EVs in the U.S.
 
Ford is offering the adapters for free to the owners, who can sign up on the Ford.com website to reserve them between Thursday and June 30. The company will provide one free adapter per vehicle. Tesla&#x27;s network was turned on Wednesday morning, and software enabling the Ford vehicles to charge at Tesla stations was to be sent out around the same time. Ford will switch to Tesla&#x27;s charging connector with its second-generation EVs starting next year.

                              <span>A B.C. lawyer has been ordered to pay costs for opposing counsel for the time they took to discover that two cases she cited as precedent were created by ChatGPT. CBC News reports: The cases would have provided compelling precedent for a divorced dad to take his children to China -- had they been real. But instead of savouring courtroom victory, the Vancouver lawyer for a millionaire embroiled in an acrimonious split has been told to personally compensate her client&#x27;s ex-wife&#x27;s lawyers for the time it took them to learn the cases she hoped to cite were conjured up by ChatGPT. In a decision released Monday, a B.C. Supreme Court judge reprimanded lawyer Chong Ke for including two AI &quot;hallucinations&quot; in an application filed last December. The cases never made it into Ke&#x27;s arguments; they were withdrawn once she learned they were non-existent.
 
Justice David Masuhara said he didn&#x27;t think the lawyer intended to deceive the court -- but he was troubled all the same. &quot;As this case has unfortunately made clear, generative AI is still no substitute for the professional expertise that the justice system requires of lawyers,&quot; Masuhara wrote in a &quot;final comment&quot; appended to his ruling. &quot;Competence in the selection and use of any technology tools, including those powered by AI, is critical.&quot;

The true cost of owning one might be much greater, however. Consumer Reports (CR) has released the findings of a security investigation into two budget-minded doorbell brands, Eken and Tuck, which are largely the same hardware produced by the Eken Group in China, according to CR. The cameras are further resold under at least 10 more brands. The cameras are set up through a common mobile app, Aiwit. And the cameras share something else, CR claims: &quot;troubling security vulnerabilities.&quot;

As part of the changes, users will start to get more helpful search suggestions in Chrome based on what others are searching for, see more images for suggested searches and find search suggestions even with a poor connection. 

Search suggestions are the drop-down list of suggested completions that appear before you finish typing out your query in Google. The feature generates predictions to help users save time and speed up their search. With these new updates, Google is expanding the availability of search suggestions and using them to boost inspiration. When users are signed into Chrome on desktop and open a new tab, they will now start to see suggestions in the search box related to their previous searches based on what other people are searching for.

                              <span>Several internet-connected doorbell cameras have a security flaw that allows hackers to take over the camera by just holding down a button, among other issues, according to research by Consumer Reports. From a report: On Thursday, the non-profit Consumer Reports published research that detailed four security and privacy flaws in cameras made by EKEN, a company based in Shenzhen, China, which makes cameras branded as EKEN, but also, apparently, Tuck and other brands. These relatively cheap doorbell cameras were available on online marketplaces like Walmart and Temu, which removed them from sale after Consumer Reports reached out to the companies to flag the problems. These doorbell cameras are, however, still available elsewhere. 

According to Consumer Reports, the most impactful issue is that if someone is in close proximity to a EKEN doorbell camera, they can take &quot;full control&quot; of it by simply downloading its official app -- called Aiwit -- and putting the camera in pairing mode by simply holding down the doorbell&#x27;s button for eight seconds. Aiwit&#x27;s app has more than a million downloads on Google Play, suggesting it is widely used. At that point, the malicious user can create their own account on the app, scan the QR code generated by the app by putting it in front of the doorbell&#x27;s camera.

                              <span>Rockstar Games, a division of Take-Two Interactive Software, will ask employees to return to the office five days a week beginning in April as the video-game maker enters the final stages of development on its next game, the hotly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI. Bloomberg: In an email to staff on Wednesday reviewed by Bloomberg, Rockstar Head of Publishing Jenn Kolbe said the decision was made for productivity and security reasons. The company has faced several security breaches including a massive dump of early footage from the new Grand Theft Auto and an early trailer that leaked in December. Kolbe wrote that the company also found &quot;tangible benefits&quot; from in-person work. &quot;Making these changes now puts us in the best position to deliver the next Grand Theft Auto at the level of quality and polish we know it requires, along with a publishing roadmap that matches the scale and ambition of the game,&quot; she wrote.

                              <span>Apple plans to disclose more about its plans to put generative AI to use later this year, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said during the company&#x27;s annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday. From a report: Cook said that the iPhone maker sees &quot;incredible breakthrough potential for generative AI, which is why we&#x27;re currently investing significantly in this area. We believe that will unlock transformative opportunities for users when it comes to productivity, problem solving and more.&quot; 

Apple has been slower in rolling out generative AI, which can generate human-like responses to written prompts, than rivals such as Microsoftand Alphabet&#x27;s Google, which are weaving them into products. On Wednesday, Cook argued that AI is already at work behind the scenes in Apple&#x27;s products but said there would be more news on explicit AI features later this year. Bloomberg previously reported Apple plans to use AI to improve the ability to search through data stored on Apple devices. &quot;Every Mac that is powered by Apple silicon is an extraordinarily capable AI machine. In fact, there&#x27;s no better computer for AI on the market today,&quot; Cook said.

                              <span>Microsoft has outlined a new Windows API designed to offer a seamless way for game developers to integrate super resolution AI-upscaling features from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel. From a report: In a new blog post, program manager Joshua Tucker describes Microsoft&#x27;s new DirectSR API as the &quot;missing link&quot; between games and super resolution technologies, and says it should provide &quot;a smoother, more efficient experience that scales across hardware.&quot; 

&quot;This API enables multi-vendor SR [super resolution] through a common set of inputs and outputs, allowing a single code path to activate a variety of solutions including Nvidia DLSS Super Resolution, AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution, and Intel XeSS,&quot; the post reads. The pitch seems to be that developers will be able to support this DirectSR API, rather than having to write code for each and every upscaling technology. 

The blog post comes a couple of weeks after an &quot;Automatic Super Resolution&quot; feature was spotted in a test version of Windows 11, which promised to &quot;use AI to make supported games play more smoothly with enhanced details.&quot; Now, it seems the feature will plug into existing super resolution technologies like DLSS, FSR, and XeSS rather than offering a Windows-level alternative.

                              <span>Eating ultraprocessed foods raises the risk of developing or dying from dozens of adverse health conditions, according to a new review of 45 meta-analyses on almost 10 million people. From a report: &quot;We found consistent evidence linking higher intakes of ultra-processed foods with over 70% of the 45 different health outcomes we assessed,&quot; said senior author Wolfgang Marx, a senior research fellow at the Food &amp; Mood Centre at Deakin University in Geelong, Australia, in an email. A higher intake was considered about one serving or about 10% more ultraprocessed foods per day, said Heinz Freisling, a scientist in the nutrition and metabolism branch of the World Health Organization&#x27;s International Agency for Research on Cancer, in an email. 

&quot;This proportion can be regarded as &#x27;baseline&#x27; and for people consuming more than this baseline, the risk might increase,&quot; said Freisling, who was not involved in the study. Researchers graded each study as having credible or strong, highly suggestive, suggestive, weak or no evidence. All the studies in the review were published in the past three years, and none was funded by companies involved in the production of ultraprocessed foods, the authors said. &quot;Strong evidence shows that a higher intake of ultra-processed foods was associated with approximately 50% higher risk of cardiovascular disease-related death and common mental disorders,&quot; said lead author Dr. Melissa Lane, a postdoctoral research fellow at Deakin, in an email. Cardiovascular disease encompasses heart attacks, stroke, clogged arteries and peripheral artery disease.

Because I can guarantee, the people who wrote that documentation are not new. :-) 

So take time to read the docs and file issues (or better yet, pull requests) for anything that was unclear. This lets you get a &quot;feel&quot; for contributing in a project/community without needing to go way down the deep end of learning coding standards and unit tests and commit signing and whatever other bananas things they&#x27;re about to make you do. :) Also, people are more likely to take time to help you, if you&#x27;ve helped them first!

Every mistake needed to be rigorously understood and any human death was unforgivable. But my view has evolved over time as human drivers have continued to kill tens of thousands of people a year. We need a solution that&#x27;s meaningfully better than human drivers, yes, but we shouldn&#x27;t wait for perfection before we start getting dangerous human drivers off the streets. 

Lost in all the fulminating about automation and big-tech tyranny is the fact that self-driving cars are an attempt to solve a very serious problem. Traffic fatalities are a leading cause of death in the United States for anyone between the ages of 1 and 54. About 40,000 pe…</span>

                              <span>Citing potential national security risks, the Biden administration says it will investigate Chinese-made &quot;smart cars&quot; that can gather sensitive information about Americans driving them. From a report: The probe could lead to new regulations aimed at preventing China from using sophisticated technology in electric cars and other so-called connected vehicles to track drivers and their personal information. Officials are concerned that features such as driver assistance technology could be used to effectively spy on Americans. 

While the action stops short of a ban on Chinese imports, President Joe Biden said he is taking unprecedented steps to safeguard Americans&#x27; data. &quot;China is determined to dominate the future of the auto market, including by using unfair practices,&quot; Biden said in a statement Thursday. &quot;China&#x27;s policies could flood our market with its vehicles, posing risks to our national security. I&#x27;m not going to let that happen on my watch.&quot; Biden and other officials noted that China has imposed wide-ranging restrictions on American autos and other foreign vehicles. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said connected cars &quot;are like smart phones on wheels&quot; and pose a serious national security risk.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: Perceiving the demand for alternatives, AI startup Hugging Face several years ago teamed up with ServiceNow, the workflow automation platform, to create StarCoder, an open source code generator with a less restrictive license than some of the others out there. The original came online early last year, and work has been underway on a follow-up, StarCoder 2, ever since. StarCoder 2 isn&#x27;t a single code-generating model, but rather a family. Released today, it comes in three variants, the first two of which can run on most modern consumer GPUs: A 3-billion-parameter (3B) model trained by ServiceNow; A 7-billion-parameter (7B) model trained by Hugging Face; and A 15-billion-parameter (15B) model trained by Nvidia, the newest supporter of the …</span>

                              <span>I always thought it was a software problem — or at least a difference of aesthetics expressed in software. But it turns out  the reason many Mac owners, including yours truly, so strongly dislike how fonts typically look on Windows is actually a hardware problem!
 See, every Mac with a screen has since 2018 shipped with a retina-class display. That means a pixel-per-inch count in excess of 218. High enough that you can&#x27;t see the individual pixels with the naked eye. With a high-resolution display like that, you can run it at 2x or 200%. So a 27&quot; 5K Apple Studio Display (218 PPI) that runs natively at 5120x2880 can run at 2x  and give you the equivalent of a 2560x1440 workspace, but with much nicer rendering. And that&#x27;s the magic. That 2x/200%. That&#x27;s why fonts on the Mac look so good out o…</span>

                              <span>As part of its IPO filing with the SEC, Reddit disclosed that it has invested some of its excess cash in bitcoin, ether and Polygon. From a report: Based on the document, the firm now holds BTC and ETH in its balance sheet. Notably, Reddit filing came as part of the IPO registration statement with the SEC. Apart from ETH and BTC, the filing revealed Reddit&#x27;s investment in Polygon (MATIC). According to the document, the social media platform plans to use both Ether and Polygon as a form of payment for digital goods. Further, Reddit noted that the amount of Polygon and Ethereum from virtual goods is currently immaterial. However, it indicated the possibility of a continuous addition of Bitcoin and Ethereum to its treasury. Also, it plans to keep trying out its passion for virtual goods. Moreover, the document revealed that Reddit made the investments using some of its excess cash reserves. However, the firm didn&#x27;t disclose details of the crypto investments it made.
 
Reddit&#x27;s filing document revealed why the popular social media platform dabbled into crypto. According to the firm, it holds Bitcoin and Ethereum to enable its engineering and product teams to use them. Further, it cited the present regulatory stance that suggests these two assets are potentially non-securities under US laws. Also, Reddit disclosed its plans to expand its crypto holding by including other digital assets in its balance sheet. However, it highlighted that such a move will depend on future regulations that exempt crypto as a security.

                              <span>&quot;Today, the KDE Community is announcing a new major release of Plasma 6.0 and Gear 24.02,&quot; writes longtime Slashdot reader jrepin. &quot;The new version brings new windows and desktop overview effects, improved color management, a cleaner theme, better overall performance, and much more.&quot; From the announcement: KDE Plasma is a modern, feature-rich desktop environment for Linux-based operating systems. Known for its sleek design, customizable interface, and extensive set of applications, it is also open source, devoid of ads, and makes protecting your privacy and personal data a priority.
 
With Plasma 6, the technology stack has undergone two major upgrades: a transition to the latest version of the application framework, Qt 6, and a migration to the modern Linux graphics platform, Wayland. We will continue providing support for the legacy X11 session for users who prefer to stick with it for now. [...] KDE Gear 24.02 brings many applications to Qt 6. In addition to the changes in Breeze, many applications adopted a more frameless look for their interface.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Convicted FTX fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried pleaded for a lenient prison sentence in a court filing yesterday, saying that he isn&#x27;t motivated by greed and &quot;is already being punished.&quot; Bankman-Fried requested a sentence of 63 to 78 months, or 5.25 to 6.5 years. Because of &quot;Sam&#x27;s charitable works and demonstrated commitment to others, a sentence that returns Sam promptly to a productive role in society would be sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes of sentencing,&quot; the court filing (PDF) said. Bankman-Fried&#x27;s filing also said that he maintains his innocence and intends to appeal his convictions.
 
A presentence investigation report (PSR) prepared by a probation officer recommended that Bankman-Fried be sentenced to 100 years in prison, according to the filing. &quot;That recommendation is grotesque,&quot; SBF&#x27;s filing said, arguing that it is based on an erroneously calculated loss of $10 billion. The $10 billion loss asserted in the PSR is &quot;illusory&quot; because the &quot;victims are poised to recover -- were always poised to recover -- a hundred cents on the dollar&quot; in bankruptcy proceedings, SBF&#x27;s filing said. The filing urged the court to &quot;reject the PSR&#x27;s barbaric proposal&quot; of 100 years, saying that such sentences should only be for &quot;heinous conduct&quot; like terrorism and child sexual abuse.
 
The founder and ex-CEO of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, Bankman-Fried was convicted on seven charges with a combined maximum sentence of 110 years after a monthlong trial in US District Court for the Southern District of New York. The charges included wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, securities fraud, commodities fraud, and money laundering. US government prosecutors are required to make a sentencing recommendation by March 15, and US District Judge Lewis Kaplan is scheduled to issue a sentence on March 28.

The company is also working to create fully autonomous AI-powered fabs in the future. Tom&#x27;s Hardware: Intel&#x27;s Keyvan Esfarjani, the company&#x27;s EVP and GM and Foundry Manufacturing and Supply, held a very insightful session that covered the company&#x27;s latest developments and showed how the roadmap unfolds over the coming years. Here, we can see two charts, with the first outlining the company&#x27;s K-WSPW (thousands of wafer starts per week) capacity for Intel&#x27;s various process nodes.

                              <span>EU lawmakers on Wednesday approved draft rules governing patents key to technologies for telecom equipment and connected cars in the face of criticism from Nokia, Ericsson and other patent holders. From a report: The draft rules proposed by the European Commission in April last year seek to end costly and lengthy litigation over patents used in technologies for telecom equipment, mobile phones, computers, connected cars and smart devices. The European Parliament will now have to thrash out the details of the proposed rules with EU countries before it can become law. Nokia, Ericsson and Siemens in a letter to EU lawmakers in January, highlighted concerns from the European Patent Office, standard-setting body ETSI and other bodies on the draft rules. Lobbying group IP Europe, which counts Nokia, Ericsson and Qualcomm as its members, reiterated its opposition to the draft rules. &quot;The beneficiaries would not be SMEs as claimed but big tech,&quot; IP Europe&#x27;s managing director Patrick McCutcheon said ahead of the lawmakers&#x27; vote.

                              <span>San Francisco will vote next week on a divisive ballot measure that would authorize police to use surveillance cameras, drones and AI-powered facial recognition as the city struggles to restore a reputation tarnished by street crime and drugs. From a report: The Safer San Francisco initiative, formally called Proposition E, is championed by Mayor London Breed who believes disgruntled citizens will approve the proposal on Tuesday. Although technology fueled the Silicon Valley-adjacent city&#x27;s decades-long boom, residents have a history of being deeply suspicious. In 2019, San Francisco, known for its progressive politics, became the first large U.S. city to ban government use of facial recognition due to concerns about privacy and misuse. 

Breed, who is running for re-election in November, played down the potential for abuse under the ballot measure, saying safeguards are in place. &quot;I get that people are concerned about privacy rights and other things, but technology is all around us,&quot; she said in an interview. &quot;It&#x27;s coming whether we want it to or not. And everyone is walking around with AI in their hands with their phones, recording, videotaping,&quot; Breed said. Critics of the proposal contend it could hurt disadvantaged communities and lead to false arrests, arguing surveillance technology requires greater oversight.

                              <span>President Joe Biden will issue an executive order on Wednesday aimed at curbing foreign governments&#x27; ability to buy Americans&#x27; sensitive personal information such as heath and geolocation data, according to senior US officials. From a report: The move marks a rare policy effort to address a longstanding US national security concern: the ease with which anyone, including a foreign intelligence services, can legally buy Americans&#x27; data and then use the information for espionage, hacking and blackmail. The issue, a senior Justice Department official told reporters this week, is a &quot;growing threat to our national security.&quot; 

The executive order will give the Justice Department the authority to regulate commercial transactions that &quot;pose an unacceptable risk&quot; to national security by, for example, giving a foreign power large-scale access to Americans&#x27; personal data, the Justice Department official said. The department will also issue regulations that require better protection of sensitive government information, including geolocation data on US military members, according to US officials. A lot of the online trade in personal information runs through so-called data brokers, which buy information on people&#x27;s Social Security numbers, names, addresses, income, employment history and criminal background, as well as other items. 

&quot;Countries of concern, such as China and Russia, are buying Americans&#x27; sensitive personal data from data brokers,&quot; a separate senior administration official told reporters. In addition to health and location data, the executive order is expected to cover other sensitive information like genomic and financial data. Administration officials told reporters the new executive order would be applied narrowly so as not to hurt business transactions that do not pose a national security risk.

                              <span>Over the past four centuries quadrillions of ants have created a strange and turbulent global society that shadows our own. An excerpt from an Aeon article: In their native ranges, these multi-nest colonies can grow to a few hundred metres across, limited by physical barriers or other ant colonies. This turns the landscape to a patchwork of separate groups, with each chemically distinct society fighting or avoiding others at their borders. Species and colonies coexist, without any prevailing over the others. However, for the &#x27;anonymous societies&#x27; of unicolonial ants, as they&#x27;re known, transporting a small number of queens and workers to a new place can cause the relatively stable arrangement of groups to break down. As new nests are created, colonies bud and spread without ever drawing boundaries because workers treat all others of their own kind as allies. What was once a patchwork of complex relationships becomes a simplified, and unified, social system. The relative genetic homogeneity of the small founder population, replicated across a growing network of nests, ensures that members of unicolonial species tolerate each other. Spared the cost of fighting one another, these ants can live in denser populations, spreading across the land as a plant might, and turning their energies to capturing food and competing with other species. Chemical badges keep unicolonial ant societies together, but also allow those societies to rapidly expand.

                              <span>Tontoman shares a report: The White House Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD) urged tech companies to switch to memory-safe programming languages, such as Rust, to improve software security by reducing the number of memory safety vulnerabilities. Such vulnerabilities are coding errors or weaknesses within software that can lead to memory management issues when memory can be accessed, written, allocated, or deallocated. They occur when software accesses memory in unintended or unsafe ways, resulting in various security risks and issues like buffer overflow, use after free, use of uninitialized memory, and double free that attackers can exploit. 

Successful exploitation carries severe risks, potentially enabling threat actors to gain unauthorized access to data or execute malicious code with the privileges of the system owner. &quot;For over 35 years, this same class of vulnerability has vexed the digital ecosystem. The challenge of eliminating entire classes of software vulnerabilities is an urgent and complex problem. Looking forward, new approaches must be taken to mitigate this risk,&quot; ONCD&#x27;s report says. &quot;The highest leverage method to reduce memory safety vulnerabilities is to secure one of the building blocks of cyberspace: the programming language. Using memory safe programming languages can eliminate most memory safety errors.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report (paywalled): As Google grapples with the backlash over the historically inaccurate responses on its Gemini chatbot, Meta Platforms is dealing with a related issue. As part of its work on the forthcoming version of its large language model, Llama 3, Meta is trying to overcome a problem perceived in Llama 2: Its answers to anything at all contentious aren&#x27;t helpful. Safeguards added to Llama 2, which Meta released last July and which powers the artificial intelligence assistant in its apps, prevent the LLM from answering a broad range of questions deemed controversial. These guardrails have made Llama 2 appear too &quot;safe&quot; in the eyes of Meta&#x27;s senior leadership, as well as among some researchers who worked on the model itself, according to people who work at Meta. 

[...] Meta&#x27;s conservative approach with Llama 2 was designed to ward off any public relations disasters, said the people who work at Meta. But researchers are now trying to loosen up Llama 3 so it engages more with users when they ask about difficult topics, offering context rather than just shutting down tricky questions, said two of the people who work at Meta. The new version of the model will in theory be able to better distinguish when a word has multiple meanings. For example, Llama 3 might understand that a question about how to kill a vehicle&#x27;s engine means asking how to shut it off rather than end its life. Meta also plans to appoint someone internally in the coming weeks to oversee tone and safety training as part of its efforts to make the model&#x27;s responses more nuanced, said one of the people. The company plans to release Llama 3 in July, though the timeline could still change, they added.

                              <span>Google CEO Sundar Pichai addressed the company&#x27;s Gemini controversy Tuesday evening, calling the AI app&#x27;s problematic responses around race unacceptable and vowing to make structural changes to fix the problem. The memo: I want to address the recent issues with problematic text and image responses in the Gemini app (formerly Bard). I know that some of its responses have offended our users and shown bias -- to be clear, that&#x27;s completely unacceptable and we got it wrong. 

Our teams have been working around the clock to address these issues. We&#x27;re already seeing a substantial improvement on a wide range of prompts. No AI is perfect, especially at this emerging stage of the industry&#x27;s development, but we know the bar is high for us and we will keep at it for however long it takes. And we&#x27;ll …</span>

                              <span>Thrasio, which acquires third-party Amazon sellers, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and received commitments for $90 million in new financing from existing shareholders, it said on Wednesday. From a report: Thrasio also entered into a restructuring agreement with some of its lenders to reduce debt of $495 million from its existing debt pile, it said in a statement. It listed its estimated assets in the range of $1 billion to $10 billion and estimated liabilities of $500 million to $1 billion, according to a document filed with the New Jersey bankruptcy court. Billions of dollars, primarily in loans and other debt instruments, were invested into newly-formed startups aggregating third-party merchants on Amazon&#x27;s marketplace during the COVID-19 pandemic as investors bet heavily on a prolonged explosion in online shopping. But as lockdowns eased and consumers returned to brick-and-mortar stores, sales growth on Amazon slowed, leaving these heavily-indebted &quot;roll-up&quot; companies struggling to service interest payments.

The controversial strategy seeks to leverage real-time data to align pricing and demand, enhancing efficiency and potentially improving customer satisfaction. From a report: During a conference call earlier this month, Wendy&#x27;s CEO Kirk Tanner said the fast-food chain would experiment with dynamic pricing as early as next year. &quot;Beginning as early as 2025, we will begin testing more enhanced features like dynamic pricing and daypart offerings, along with AI-enabled menu changes and suggestive selling,&quot; he said. &quot;As we continue to show the benefit of this technology in our company-operated rest…</span>

The Ubiquiti EdgeRouters make an ideal hideout for hackers. The inexpensive gear, used in homes and small offices, runs a version of Linux that can host malware that surreptitiously runs behind the scenes. The hackers then use the routers to conduct their malicious activities. Rather than using infrastructure and IP addresses that are known to be hostile, the connections come from benign-appearing devices hosted by addresses with trustworthy reputations, allowing them to receive a green light from security defenses.

                              <span>Since Clippy v0.0.97 and before it was shipped with rustup, Clippy
implicitly added a feature &#x3D; &quot;cargo-clippy&quot; config1 when linting your code
with cargo clippy.
Back in the day (2016) this was necessary to allow, warn or deny Clippy lints
using attributes:
#[cfg_attr(feature &#x3D; &quot;cargo-clippy&quot;, allow(clippy_lint_name))]

Doing this hasn&#x27;t been necessary for a long time. Today, Clippy users will set
lint levels with tool lint attributes using the clippy:: prefix:
#[allow(clippy::lint_name)]

The implicit feature &#x3D; &quot;cargo-clippy&quot; has only been kept for backwards
compatibility, but will now be deprecated.
Alternative
As there is a rare use case for conditional compilation depending on Clippy,
we will provide an alternative. So in the future you will be able to use:
#[cfg(clippy)]

It&#x27;s common for advertisements to stage or edit pictures of food to make it look more enticing, but in these cases the ghost kitchens are showing people pictures of food that literally doesn&#x27;t exist, and looks nothing like the actual items they&#x27;re selling, sometimes because the faulty AI is producing physically impossible food items. [...] Some ghost kitchens exist as unmarked commercial kitchens with no actual restaurant you can visit that simply fulfill orders for a variety of brands that only exist on the food delivery services. Other ghost kitchens piggyback on ex…</span>

                              <span>Apple has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for refusing to grant trademarks covering the company&#x27;s augmented-reality software development tools &quot;Reality Composer&quot; and &quot;Reality Converter.&quot; Reuters reports: Apple, whose augmented-reality technology is a centerpiece of its newly released Vision Pro headset, asked the court (PDF) on Friday to reverse the USPTO&#x27;s decision that the phrases were not distinctive enough to receive federal trademark protection. &quot;Consumers must exercise imagination to understand how the nonsensical phrases &#x27;reality composer&#x27; and &#x27;reality converter&#x27; -- which sound like science fiction impossibilities -- relate to Apple&#x27;s products,&quot; the complaint said. &quot;They are suggestive, just as Burger King is a fast-food chain, not an actual monarch.&quot;

                              <span>Amazon has issued an update to Fire TV streaming devices and televisions that has broken apps that let users bypass the Fire OS home screen. From a report: The tech giant claims that its latest Fire OS update is about security but has refused to detail any potential security concerns. Users and app developers have reported that numerous apps that used to work with Fire TV devices for years have suddenly stopped working. As first reported by AFTVnews, the update has made apps unable to establish local Android Debug Bridge (ADB) connections and execute ADB commands with Fire TV devices. 

The update, Fire OS 7.6.6.9, affects several Fire OS-based TVs, including models from TCL, Toshiba, Hisense, and Amazon&#x27;s Fire TV Omni QLED Series. Other devices running the update include Amazon&#x27;s first Fire TV Stick 4K Max, the third-generation Fire TV Stick, as well as the third and second-generation Fire TV Cubes and the Fire TV Stick Lite. A code excerpt shared with AFTVnews by what the publication described as an &quot;affected app developer,&quot; which you can view here, shows a line of code indicating that Fire TVs would not be allowed to make ADB connections with a local device or app. As pointed out by AFTVnews, such apps have been used by Fire TV modders for abilities like clearing installed apps&#x27; cache and using a different home screen than the Fire OS default.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Microsoft is already testing Windows 11 24H2, this fall&#x27;s big new Windows release. The company has already demonstrated a few new features, like 80Gbps USB4 support and Sudo for Windows, and the new version could also give a significant refresh to the Windows installer for the first time since the Windows Vista days. But there&#x27;s one big update you might not notice at all. Late last week, Microsoft released &quot;servicing updates&quot; with no new features to Windows Insiders in the Dev and Canary channels. The updates were &quot;designed to test [Microsoft&#x27;s] servicing pipeline for Windows 11.&quot; It&#x27;s pretty common for Insiders to get these kinds of updates-that-exist-only-to-test-the-update-process, but the twist here is that PCs with Virtualization Based Security (VBS) enabled could apply the update without rebooting. 

Sources speaking to Windows Central say this isn&#x27;t a fluke -- Microsoft reportedly intends to use a Windows Server feature called hotpatching to deliver more Windows 11 security updates without requiring a reboot, making it easier to stay up to date without disrupting whatever you&#x27;re doing. You&#x27;ll still need to reboot &quot;every few months&quot; -- Microsoft&#x27;s documentation says a reboot is needed roughly once every three months, though it can happen more often than that for unanticipated zero-day patches and others that can&#x27;t be fixed via hotpatching. The Arm versions of Windows 11 also won&#x27;t get the feature for another year or so, according to Windows Central.

                              <span>Bloomberg News: Apple is canceling a decade-long effort to build an electric car, according to people with knowledge of the matter, abandoning one of the most ambitious projects in the history of the company. Apple made the disclosure internally Tuesday, surprising the nearly 2,000 employees working on the project, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the announcement wasn&#x27;t public. 

The decision was shared by Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams and Kevin Lynch, a vice president in charge of the effort, according to the people. The two executives told staffers that the project will begin winding down and that many employees on the team working on the car -- known as the Special Projects Group, or SPG -- will be shifted to the artificial intelligence division under executive John Giannandrea. Those employees will focus on generative AI projects, an increasingly key priority for the company. The Apple car team also has several hundred hardware engineers and car designers. It&#x27;s possible that they will be able to apply for jobs on other Apple teams. There will be layoffs, but it&#x27;s unclear how many. 

The decision to ultimately wind down the project is a bombshell for the company, ending a multibillion-dollar effort that would have vaulted Apple into a whole new industry. The tech giant started working on a car around 2014, setting its sights on a fully autonomous electric vehicle with a limousine-like interior and voice-guided navigation. But the project struggled nearly from the start, with Apple changing the team&#x27;s leadership and strategy several times. Lynch and Williams took over the undertaking a few years ago -- following the departure of Doug Field, now a senior executive at Ford Motor.

                              <span>Tumblr and Wordpress are preparing to sell user data to Midjourney and OpenAI, 404Media reported Tuesday, citing a source with internal knowledge about the deals and internal documents. From the report: The exact types of data from each platform going to each company are not spelled out in documentation we&#x27;ve reviewed, but internal communications reviewed by 404 Media make clear that deals between Automattic, the platforms&#x27; parent company, and OpenAI and Midjourney are imminent. The internal documentation details a messy and controversial process within Tumblr itself. One internal post made by Cyle Gage, a product manager at Tumblr, states that a query made to prepare data for OpenAI and Midjourney compiled a huge number of user posts that it wasn&#x27;t supposed to. It is not clear from Gage&#x27;s post whether this data has already been sent to OpenAI and Midjourney, or whether Gage was detailing a process for scrubbing the data before it was to be sent.

From a report: OpenAI said in a filing in Manhattan federal court on Monday that the Times caused the technology to reproduce its material through &quot;deceptive prompts that blatantly violate OpenAI&#x27;s terms of use.&quot; 

&quot;The allegations in the Times&#x27;s complaint do not meet its famously rigorous journalistic standards,&quot; OpenAI said. &quot;The truth, which will come out in the course of this case, is that the Times paid someone to hack OpenAI&#x27;s products.&quot; OpenAI did not name the &quot;hired gun&quot; who it said the Times used to manipulate its systems and did not accuse the newspaper of breaking any anti-hacking laws.

                              <span>Undersea data cables in the Red Sea have reportedly been damaged, months after Yemeni Houthi rebels threatened to do so. From a report: At least 15 submarine cables pass through the Bab al-Mandab Strait at the southern end of the Red Sea, a body of water just 26km wide at some points. Yemen is the Strait&#x27;s northern shore. The first reports of damage to submarine cables off the coast of Yemen began emerged on Monday morning, with Israeli news outlet Globes claiming that four cables (EIG, AAE-1, Seacom and TGN-EA) had experienced damage. Seacom has reportedly confirmed damage to a cable it operates on a stretch between Kenya and Egypt. 

&quot;The location of the cable break is significant due to its geopolitical sensitivity and ongoing tensions, making it a challenging environment for maintenance and repair operations,&quot; Seacom said. &quot;The team is currently working towards restoration timelines and will communicate these plans with our clients.&quot; Globes attributed the outages to the Iran-backed Houthis, and claimed the damage was &quot;significant, but not critical,&quot; because several other undersea cables serve the region. Seacom has already reassured customers it has re-routed traffic onto other cables. While the world has a decent supply of cable repair ships, they are booked up well in advance so finding one ready to work is not always possible. Nor are cable repairs easy: it takes time to find and retrieve a damaged segment and reconnect it.

                              <span>Streaming revenue will overtake pay TV subscription revenue in the U.S. for the first time later in 2024, helped by the addition of ad tiers by various streamers, according to a new forecast. From a report: Total revenues from streaming, including subscription and advertising revenue, will start topping revenue from pay TV subscriptions in the third quarter of 2024, research company Ampere Analysis projects in a new study unveiled on Monday. &quot;Streaming will continue to race ahead as traditional pay TV declines -- with the value of pay TV in 2028 expected to fall to half the value it saw at its peak in 2017,&quot; it predicts.
Streaming subscribers overtook pay TV subs in the U.S. in 2016, but &quot;streaming&#x27;s lower average revenue per user (ARPU), which currently sits at around a tenth that of pay TV, means that revenue is only now catching up,&quot; Ampere explained. U.S. pay TV revenue will still be narrowly ahead of streaming revenue in the second quarter at $17.1 billion to $17 billion, followed by a $17.3 billion to $16.7 billion streaming lead in the third quarter, according to the research firm&#x27;s projections.

                              <span>AI is likely to replace or at least lend a hand in tasks that take up almost three-quarters of the time bank employees now spend working. From a report: That&#x27;s the conclusion of a new analysis by consultancy Accenture, which said banking has the potential to benefit more from the technology than any other industry. Just 27% of employees&#x27; time currently has a low potential of being transformed, according to the analysis. &quot;There is a reinvention that is happening across banks, a way for firms to step back and re-evaluate ways of working,&quot; Keri Smith, global banking data and AI lead at Accenture, said in an interview. 

The release of ChatGPT more than a year ago prompted many firms to boost hiring for AI-related positions and test more uses for generative AI, which can summarize documents, write emails and churn out responses to users&#x27; questions. The world&#x27;s biggest banks have been experimenting, spurred by the promise that the technology will boost staffers&#x27; productivity and cut costs. &quot;Every bank needs to think through their talent strategy, and how to take this technology to scale,&quot; Smith said. At Citigroup, all 40,000 coders will have the ability to experiment with different AI technologies by the end of March. Analysts at Bank of New York Mellon can wake up two hours later to write their research, because AI technology can create a rough draft and prepare related data for them overnight, Chief Executive Officer Robin Vince said on an earnings call last month.

                              <span>The U.S. and several international partners endorsed shared principles for developing 6G wireless communication systems, the White House said Monday. From a report: A battle is underway to influence the standards of 6G amid concerns by Western countries and their allies that authoritarian regimes could gain further control over Internet in their countries. Policies around wireless communications influence economic-growth and national security, fueling the race between the U.S. and China -- which claimed earlier this month that it had launched the world&#x27;s first satellite &quot;to test 6G architecture,&quot; per state media. 

The governments of the U.S., Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Japan, South Korea, Sweden and the U.K. released a joint statement saying that by working together, &quot;we can support open, free, global, interoperable, reliable, resilient, and secure connectivity.&quot; They laid out principles including using systematic approaches to cybersecurity, being protective of privacy and creating technologies that are widely available and accessible to developing nations.

                              <span>Nvidia&#x27;s completely free, no-strings attached trial of its cloud gaming service GeForce Now is about to be very slightly less of a deal. Nvidia says users will now start seeing ads. From a report: They&#x27;re only for the free tier -- not Priority or Ultimate -- and even then, it sounds like they won&#x27;t interrupt your gameplay. &quot;Free users will start to see up to two minutes of ads while waiting in queue to start a gaming session,&quot; writes Nvidia spokesperson Stephanie Ngo. Currently, the free tier does often involve waiting in line for a remote computer to free up before every hour of free gameplay -- now, I guess there&#x27;ll be a few ads too. Nvidia says the ads should help pay for the free tier of service, and that it expects the change &quot;will reduce average wait times for free users over time.&quot;

                              <span>Maker Roni Bandini developed a Raspberry Pi project to address his neighbors&#x27; loud reggaeton music by creating an AI-driven system that distorts audio on nearby Bluetooth speakers when reggaeton is detected. Tom&#x27;s Hardware reports: Powering this Bluetooth jamming device is a Raspberry Pi 3 B+. It&#x27;s connected to a DFRobot OLED display panel, which has a resolution of 128 x 32px. Audio is observed using a USB microphone, while a push button handles when the system will perform a check to listen for any potential reggaeton. According to Bandini, the Pi is running Raspberry Pi OS. The AI system driving the machine learning aspects of the design is Edge Impulse. With this, Bandini was able to train the Pi to listen for music and more specifically identify whether the song playing is classifiable as reggaeton or not. The official project page is available at Hackster.

                              <span>Some programmers can code under any conditions. Open office? They&#x27;ll bring headphones. Whatever editor is on their system? They&#x27;ll make it work. Using a different framework or language every few years? No problem. I envy that level of versatility, but I&#x27;ve come to accept it just isn&#x27;t me. I bond with a quiet room, an editor, and a programming environment far more deeply than that.
 Case in point, I&#x27;ve been using the TextMate programming editor since it was first created back in 2004. That&#x27;s twenty years now. Almost as long as my time with Ruby working on Rails. TextMate has seen its popularity come and go in that time, and today, few people are still choosing it. But I don&#x27;t care. It&#x27;s damn near Finished Software as far as I&#x27;m concerned, and I love programming with TextMate.

Or teaching ceramics without having people work with clay.
Or teaching tennis without swinging the racket and hitting balls.
I’m sure there’s some way to teach those things without doing those things, but come on, we all know you have to do those things to really learn those things.
I believe business is in the same category. It’s much closer to learning an art, sport, or instrument than it is to learning history, political science, or another subject primarily taught through written texts, lectures, or observing without doing.
Yet how many entrepreneurship programs out there require their students to start a real business? They may exist, but I’ve been around and haven’t seen one yet. It can be the simplest damn bus…</span>

  teams that work in a Remote-First
  style, a trend that was boosted by the forced isolation of Covid-19 pandemic.
  But a team that operates remotely still benefits from face-to-face gatherings,
  and should do them every few months.
Remote-first teams have everyone in a separate location, communicating
  entirely by email, chat, video and other communication tools. It has definite
  benefits: people can be recruited to the team from all over the world, and we can

                              <span>Landscaping tech company Husqvarna has partnered with Bethesda to bring the original 1993 Doom to its $2,000+ robotic lawnmowers. Kotaku reports: This new way to play Doom arrives in April on all Nera robotic lawnmower models. You don&#x27;t have to pay for the game, either, just a $2,000+ lawnmower. Instead, just download it and play the shooter via the robo-mower&#x27;s built-in screen. To rotate your view, you turn the knob and to shoot demons, you press it down. You hold the start button to move forward.
 
A few caveats to mention. First, this isn&#x27;t available in the United States. Why? I don&#x27;t know. Perhaps we can&#x27;t be trusted with video games on lawnmowers? Secondly, this isn&#x27;t all of Doom. Instead, it&#x27;s just the first episode -- Knee Deep In The Dead -- which is arguably its most famous one, sure, but just keep in mind you won&#x27;t be able to play the rest of the beloved shooter in the middle of your backyard on a tiny LCD screen. Sorry.
 
Sadly, this won&#x27;t be a permanent feature that you can show off to family and friends for years to come. Instead, Doom and all its demons and guns will be removed from lawnmowers on September 9. So enjoy it while you can.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from TorrentFreak: In recent months, Movie-Web has quickly gained popularity among a particular group of movie aficionados. The open source software, which is still available on GitHub, allows anyone to set up a movie search engine capable of streaming content from third-party sources. These external sources tend to have large libraries of pirated entertainment. Movie-web&#x27;s developers are not oblivious to the legal ramifications but since they don&#x27;t host any files, they hoped to avoid legal trouble. The software just provides a search engine for third-party content, they argued. [...]
 
Yesterday, the movie-web.app domain was suddenly taken down. According to a message posted on the official Discord server, this is the result of a &quot;court action&quot; from several movie companies including Warner Bros. Netflix, Paramount, Universal, and Disney. [I]t appears that action was taken against the movie-web.app domain. It seems likely that registrar Namecheap suspended the domain after receiving a legal complaint from the aforementioned Hollywood companies. [Update: After publishing the article we learned that there is a legal action that requires registrars to take action against several &#x27;pirate&#x27; domains. We&#x27;re looking into the matter and will follow this up later.]
 
Namecheap updated the domain&#x27;s status to clientHold, which effectively rendered the domain inaccessible. The measure is often used to suspend pirate site domains following copyright holder complaints. The surprise takedown only affects movie-web&#x27;s publicly hosted &#x27;demo&#x27; instance. On Discord, the movie-web team says that it has no plans to bring this website back in any shape or form. &quot;As a team, we always said that if we were taken down, we would go down without a fight and we have decided to stick to that. We have zero interest in getting involved with legal matters, and so we will not be trying to circumvent this takedown in any way,&quot; developer &#x27;BinaryOverload&#x27; writes.

                              <span>Almost 3 years after launching the first OnePlus Watch, the Chinese smartphone company is launching a successor -- this time powered by Wear OS 4. Utilizing a &quot;hybrid interface,&quot; the OnePlus Watch 2 is able to offer 100 hours of battery life, or just over four full days of use. 9to5Google reports: To achieve that goal, the OnePlus Watch 2 actually runs two separate operating systems. Wear OS handles things like apps and watchfaces, while a RTOS powered by a secondary chipset handles more lightweight tasks. A &quot;smart mode&quot; on the watch allows the watch swap back and forth between its two operating systems and two chipsets. Wear OS is powered by the Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 and it is Wear OS 4. The RTOS is powered by a BES 2700 MCU Efficiency chipset.
 
Switching between the two OS&#x27;s is something you&#x27;re likely to not even notice, OnePlus claims: &quot;The BES2700 Efficiency Chipset runs RTOS and handles background activity and simple tasks, while the Snapdragon W5 handles more demanding tasks, like running your favorite Google apps. This optimized approach, enabled by the Wear OS hybrid interface seamlessly managing the transition between chips, means users will experience a smartwatch that effortlessly does it all while extending the time between charges.&quot;
 
Powering the Watch 2 is a 500 mAh battery which features 7.5W charging with a special charger that connects to a typical USB-C cable. The charger is magnetic, of course, and OnePlus claims a full charge in 60 minutes or less. The 1.43-inch AMOLED display of the OnePlus Watch 2 is covered in a slightly curved sapphire glass, while the watch chassis is built from stainless steel. You&#x27;ll have the choice of black or silver colors with either black or green bands, respectively. The whole package is also 5ATM water resistant. Rounding out the main specs you&#x27;ll find 32GB of storage and 2GB of RAM. The OnePlus Watch 2 goes on sale today at $299.

                              <span>During a briefing at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Meghana Patwardhan, VP of Commercial Mobility at Dell Technology, told The Register that while the immediate future would consist of two worlds -- one with AI hardware and one without -- &quot;every PC is going to be an AI PC in the longer term.&quot; From the report: In terms of new hardware, Dell used the Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona to show off new versions of its Surface-baiting Latitude 7350 convertible -- &quot;the world&#x27;s most serviceable commercial detachable,&quot; according to the company -- and its workstation-class Precision 3680 tower. Other devices in the Precision range include mobile workstations and the 3280 Compact Form Factor PC. Dell was also determined to present itself as a leader in hybrid working with the Premier Wireless ANC headset, replete with AI-based noise cancellation.
 
Duringt our talk, AI was never far from the lips of Dell&#x27;s spokespeople as the company talked up the energy efficiency and future-proofing it saw in dedicated AI hardware, such as Neural Processing Units (NPUs) that are increasingly cropping up in CPUs. To illustrate the point, Dell boatsed about how much more efficient background blurring is on video calls when AI hardware is running compared to when it isn&#x27;t. Hopefully, Microsoft will soon deliver a version of Windows capable of demonstrating a use for AI hardware that is more than hiding distractions in the background.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Sony is making an effort to appease customers who will lose their entire Funimation digital libraries when the anime streaming service merges into Crunchyroll. Currently, though, the company&#x27;s plan for giving disappointed customers &quot;an appropriate value&quot; for their erased digital copies isn&#x27;t very accessible or clear. Earlier this month, Sony-owned Funimation announced that customers&#x27; digital libraries would be unavailable starting on April 2. At that time, Funimation accounts will become Crunchyroll accounts. Sony acquired Crunchyroll in 2021, so some sort of merging of the services was expected. However, less expected was customers&#x27; lost access to online copies of beloved anime that they acquired through digital codes provided in purc…</span>

                              <span>Microsoft offered to sell its Bing search engine to Apple in 2018, Google said in a court filing earlier this month. The document, from Google&#x27;s antitrust case against the U.S. Justice Department, was unsealed on Friday. From a report: In the filing earlier this month, Google argued that Microsoft pitched Apple in 2009, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2018 and 2020 about making Bing the default in Apple&#x27;s Safari web browser, but each time, Apple said no, citing quality issues with Bing. &quot;In each instance, Apple took a hard look at the relative quality of Bing versus Google and concluded that Google was the superior default choice for its Safari users. That is competition,&quot; Google wrote in the filing. 

The Justice Department said in its own newly unsealed filing that Microsoft has spent almost $100 billion on Bing over 20 years. The Windows and Office software maker launched Bing in 2009, following search efforts under the MSN and Windows Live brands. Today Bing has 3% global market share, according to StatCounter. In the fourth quarter, Microsoft generated $3.2 billion from search and news advertising, while Google search and other revenue totaled $48 billion. Google said in its filing that when Microsoft reached out to Apple in 2018, emphasizing gains in Bing&#x27;s quality, Microsoft offered to either sell Bing to Apple or establish a Bing-related joint venture with the company.

                              <span>The US Supreme Court is hearing oral arguments Monday in two cases that could dramatically reshape social media, weighing whether states such as Texas and Florida should have the power to control what posts platforms can remove from their services. From a report: The high-stakes battle gives the nation&#x27;s highest court an enormous say in how millions of Americans get their news and information, as well as whether sites such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and TikTok should be able to make their own decisions about how to moderate spam, hate speech and election misinformation. At issue are laws passed by the two states that prohibit online platforms from removing or demoting user content that expresses viewpoints -- legislation both states say is necessary to prevent censorship of conservative users. 

More than a dozen Republican attorneys general have argued to the court that social media should be treated like traditional utilities such as the landline telephone network. The tech industry, meanwhile, argues that social media companies have First Amendment rights to make editorial decisions about what to show. That makes them more akin to newspapers or cable companies, opponents of the states say.
The case could lead to a significant rethinking of First Amendment principles, according to legal experts. A ruling in favor of the states could weaken or reverse decades of precedent against &quot;compelled speech,&quot; which protects private individuals from government speech mandates, and have far-reaching consequences beyond social media. A defeat for social media companies seems unlikely, but it would instantly transform their business models, according to Blair Levin, an industry analyst at the market research firm New Street Research.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report from the ongoing Mobile World Congress trade show: This year&#x27;s big scrum gatherer was Lenovo&#x27;s long-rumored transparent laptop. It&#x27;s real. It functions surprisingly well and -- nearest anyone can tell -- its existence is a testament to form over function. That&#x27;s a perfectly fine thing to be when you&#x27;re a concept device. When it comes to actually shipping a product, however, that&#x27;s another conversation entirely. [...] Broadly speaking, it looks like a laptop, with a transparent pane where the screen should be. It&#x27;s perhaps best understood as a kind of augmented reality device, in the sense that its graphics are overlaid on whatever happens to be behind it. 

It&#x27;s a crowd pleaser, with a futuristic air to it that embodies all manner of sci-fi tech tropes. The transparent display has become a kind of shorthand for future tech in stock art, and it&#x27;s undeniably neat to see the thing in action. [...] The bottom of the device is covered in a large capacitive touch surface. This area serves as both a keyboard and a large stylus-compatible drawing surface. The flat surface can&#x27;t compete with real, tactile keyboards, of course. Typing isn&#x27;t the greatest experience here, as evidenced by previous dual-screen Lenovo laptops. But that&#x27;s the tradeoff for the versatility of the virtual version.

                              <span>Dr. Ruth Gottesman, a longtime professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, is making free tuition available to all students going forward. From a report: The 93-year-old widow of a Wall Street financier has donated $1 billion to a Bronx medical school, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, with instructions that the gift be used to cover tuition for all students going forward. The donor, Dr. Ruth Gottesman, is a former professor at Einstein, where she studied learning disabilities, developed a screening test and ran literacy programs. It is one of the largest charitable donations to an educational institution in the United States and most likely the largest to a medical school. 

The fortune came from her late husband, David Gottesman, known as Sandy, who was a protege of Warren Buffett and had made an early investment in Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate Mr. Buffett built. The donation is notable not only for its staggering size, but also because it is going to a medical institution in the Bronx, the city&#x27;s poorest borough. The Bronx has a high rate of premature deaths and ranks as the unhealthiest county in New York. Over the past generation, a number of billionaires have given hundreds of millions of dollars to better-known medical schools and hospitals in Manhattan, the city&#x27;s wealthiest borough. 

While her husband ran an investment firm, First Manhattan, Dr. Gottesman had a long career at Einstein, a well-regarded medical school, starting in 1968, when she took a job as director of psychoeducational services. She has long been on Einstein&#x27;s board of trustees and is currently the chair. In recent years, she has become close friends with Dr. Philip Ozuah, the pediatrician who oversees the medical college and its affiliated hospital, Montefiore Medical Center, as the chief executive officer of the health system. That friendship and trust loomed large as she contemplated what to do with the money her husband had left her.

                              <span>Microsoft has struck a deal with French AI startup Mistral as it seeks to broaden its involvement in the fast-growing industry beyond OpenAI. From a report: The US tech giant will provide the 10-month-old Paris-based company with help in bringing its AI models to market. Microsoft will also take a minor stake in Mistral, although the financial details have not been disclosed. The partnership makes Mistral the second company to provide commercial language models available on Microsoft&#x27;s Azure cloud computing platform. Microsoft has already invested about $13 billion in San Francisco-based OpenAI, an alliance that is being reviewed by competition watchdogs in the US, EU and UK. Other Big Tech rivals, such as Google and Amazon, are also investing heavily in building generative AI -- software that can produce text, images and code in seconds -- which analysts believe has the capacity to shake up industries across the world. WSJ adds: On Monday, Mistral plans to announce a new AI model, called Mistral Large, that Mensch said can perform some reasoning tasks comparably with GPT-4, OpenAI&#x27;s most advanced language model to date, and Gemini Ultra, Google&#x27;s new model. Mensch said his new model cost less than 20 million euros, the equivalent of roughly $22 million, to train. By contrast OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman said last year after the release of GPT-4 that training his company&#x27;s biggest models cost &quot;much more than&quot; $50 million to $100 million.

Huang argued that, even at this early stage of the AI revolution, programming is no longer a vital skill. With coding taken care of by AI, Huang suggested humans can instead focus on more valuable expertise like biology, education, manufacturing, or farming

                              <span>OpenAI, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Jeff Bezos are all part of a pack of investors in a business &quot;developing human-like robots,&quot; reports Bloomberg, &quot;according to people with knowledge of the situation...&quot; 

At the startup — which is named &quot;Figure&quot; — engineers &quot;are working on a robot that looks and moves like a human. The company has said it hopes its machine, called Figure 01, will be able to perform dangerous jobs that are unsuitable for people and that its technology will help alleviate labor shortages.&quot;

Figure is raising about $675 million in a funding round that carries a pre-money valuation of roughly $2 billion, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. Through his firm Explore Investments LLC, Bezos has committed $100 million. Microsoft is investing $95 million, while Nvidia and an Amazon.com Inc.-affiliated fund are each providing $50 million... Other technology companies are involved as well. Intel Corp.&#x27;s venture capital arm is pouring in $25 million, and LG Innotek is providing $8.5 million. Samsung&#x27;s investment group, meanwhile, committed $5 million. Backers also include venture firms Parkway Venture Capital, which is investing $100 million, and Align Ventures, which is providing $90 million... 

The AI robotics industry has been busy lately. Earlier this year, OpenAI-backed Norwegian robotics startup 1X Technologies AS raised $100 million. Vancouver-based Sanctuary AI is developing a humanoid robot called Phoenix. And Tesla Inc. is working on a robot called Optimus, with Elon Musk calling it one of his most important projects. Agility Robotics, which Amazon backed in 2022, has bots in testing at one of the retailer&#x27;s warehouses.
Bloomberg calls the investments in Figure &quot;part of a scramble to find new applications for artificial intelligence.&quot;

                              <span>The minimum requirements for Tier 1 toolchains targeting Windows will increase with the 1.78 release (scheduled for May 02, 2024).
Windows 10 will now be the minimum supported version for the *-pc-windows-* targets.
These requirements apply both to the Rust toolchain itself and to binaries produced by Rust.
Two new targets have been added with Windows 7 as their baseline: x86_64-win7-windows-msvc and i686-win7-windows-msvc.
They are starting as Tier 3 targets, meaning that the Rust codebase has support for them but we don&#x27;t build or test them automatically.
Once these targets reach Tier 2 status, they will be available to use via rustup.
Affected targets
x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
i686-pc-windows-msvc
x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
i686-pc-windows-gnu
x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm
i686-pc-windows-gnullvm
Why are the requirements being changed?
Prior to now, Rust had Tier 1 support for Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 but these targets no longer meet our requirements.
In particular, these targets could no longer be tested in CI which is required by the Target Tier Policy and are not supported by their vendor.</span>

                              <span>Julia 1.0 was released in 2018 — after a six-year wait. 

And there&#x27;s now another update. LWN.net gets you up to speed, calling Julia &quot;a general-purpose, open-source programming language with a focus on high-performance scientific computing.&quot;

Some of Julia&#x27;s unusual features: 
- Lisp-inspired metaprogramming
- The ability to examine compiled representations of code in the REPL or in a &quot;reactive notebook&quot;
- An advanced type and dispatch system
- A sophisticated, built-in package manager. 

Version 1.10 brings big increases in speed and developer convenience, especially improvements in code precompilation and loading times. It also features a new parser written in Julia... [I]t is faster, it produces more useful syntax-error messages, and it provides better source-code mapping, which associates locations in compiled code to their corresponding lines in the source. That last improvement also leads to better error messages and makes it possible to write more sophisticated debuggers and linters... 

Between the improvements in precompilation and loading times, and the progress in making small binaries, two major and perennial complaints, of beginners and seasoned Julia users alike, have been addressed... StaticCompiler and related WebAssembly tools will make it easier to write web applications in Julia for direct execution in the browser; it is already possible, but may become more convenient over the next few years.

                              <span>Popular Science points out that for encoding data, &quot;optical disks almost always offer just a single, 2D layer — that reflective, silver underside.&quot; 

&quot;If you could boost a disk&#x27;s number of available, encodable layers, however, you could hypothetically gain a massive amount of extra space...&quot;
Researchers at the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology recently set out to do just that, and published the results earlier this week in the journal, Nature. Using a 54-nanometer laser, the team managed to record a 100 layers of data onto an optical disk, with each tier separated by just 1 micrometer. The final result is an optical disk with a three-dimensional stack of data layers capable of holding a whopping 1 petabit (Pb) of information — that&#x27;s equivalent to 125,000 gigabytes of data... 

As Gizmodo offers for reference, that same petabit of information would require roughly a six-and-a-half foot tall stack of HHD drives — if you tried to encode the same amount of data onto Blu-rays, you&#x27;d need around 10,000 blank ones to complete your (extremely inefficient) challenge. 

To pull off their accomplishment, engineers needed to create an entirely new material for their optical disk&#x27;s film... AIE-DDPR film utilizes a combination of specialized, photosensitive molecules capable of absorbing photonic data at a nanoscale level, which is then encoded using a high-tech dual-laser array. Because AIE-DDPR is so incredibly transparent, designers could apply layer-upon-layer to an optical disk without worrying about degrading the overall data. This basically generated a 3D &quot;box&quot; for digitized information, thus exponentially raising the normal-sized disk&#x27;s capacity.

New research published this month by Google and Meta suggest that despite new restrictions, the cyberattack market is growing, and growing more dangerous, aiding government violence and repression and eroding democracy around the globe.

                              <span>CNN reports:

AT&amp;T is reimbursing customers for the nearly 12-hour network outage on Thursday, the company announced in a news release. The mobile network will issue a $5 credit to &quot;potentially impacted&quot; AT&amp;T Wireless customers, which it says is the &quot;average cost of a full day of service.&quot;
 
The credit will be applied automatically &quot;within 2 bill cycles,&quot; according to an announcement at the URL att.com/makeitright. &quot;We recognize the frustration this outage has caused and know we let many of our customers down.&quot; 

In a much smaller font, they note that the credit &quot;does not apply to AT&amp;T Business, AT&amp;T Prepaid or Cricket. 

More from CNN:

AT&amp;T had encountered sporadic service interruptions in the days leading up to the outage, including a temporary 911 outage in some parts of the southeast. While regional disruptions to wireless service happen occasionally, prolonged nationwide outages are rare. The Federal Communications Commission confirmed Thursday it was investigating the incident... 

 Several hours after service was restored, AT&amp;T released an update stating the outage seemed to be the result of an internal issue, not a cybersecurity threat. &quot;Based on our initial review, we believe that today&#x27;s outage was caused by the application and execution of an incorrect process used as we were expanding our network,&quot; the company said. 

On Saturday, AT&amp;T reiterated it was taking steps &quot;to prevent this from happening again in the future,&quot; but did not elaborate.

                              <span>jd (Slashdot reader #1,658) writes: The Register has been running a series of articles about the evolution of Unix, from humble beginnings to the transition to Plan9. There is a short discussion of why Plan9 and its successors never really took off (despite being vastly superior to microkernels), along with the ongoing development of 9Front. 



From the article:

Plan 9 was in some way a second implementation of the core concepts of Unix and C, but reconsidered for a world of networked graphical workstations. It took many of the trendy ideas of late-1980s computing, both of academic theories and of the computer industry of the time, and it reinterpreted them through the jaded eyes of two great gurus, Kenneth Thompson and Dennis Ritchie (and their students) — arguably, design geniuses who saw their previous good ideas misunderstood and misinterpreted.

 In Plan 9, networking is front and center. There are good reasons why this wasn&#x27;t the case with Unix — it was being designed and built at the same time as local area networking was being invented. UNIX Fourth Edition, the first version written in C, was released in 1973 — the same year as the first version of Ethernet.

 Plan 9 puts networking right into the heart of the design. While Unix was later used as the most common OS for standalone workstations, Plan 9 was designed for clusters of computers, some being graphical desktops and some shared servers...

 Because everything really is a file, displaying a window on another machine can be as simple as making a directory and populating it with some files. You can start programs on other computers, but display the results on yours — all without any need for X11 or any visible networking at all. 

This means all the Unixy stuff about telnet and rsh and ssh and X forwarding and so on just goes away. It makes X11 look very overcomplicated, and it makes Wayland look like it was invented by Microsoft.

                              <span>Netflix&#x27;s new sci-fi drama Spaceman centers on Czech astronaut Jakub Procházk, described by Polygon as &quot;painfully introverted, emotionally repressed, and above all, quiet... so muted and compressed, he seems like a trauma victim.&quot;

The film, adapted from the 2017 novel Spaceman of Bohemia written by Czech author Jaroslav KalfaÅ(TM), is a solemn drama in the mold of Andrei Tarkovsky&#x27;s Solaris, or to some degree, Christopher Nolan&#x27;s Interstellar. The story revolves around Jakub&#x27;s disintegrating frame of mind after eight months alone in space as he investigates a glowing cosmic phenomenon that&#x27;s become visible from Earth. Meanwhile, his wife Lenka (Carey Mulligan), heavily pregnant and going through her own breakdown back home, decides to leave Jakub, and his handlers (Isabella Rossellini among them) work to keep him from finding out. And then the giant spider appears, and Jakub worries that he&#x27;s losing his mind.
 

CNN says Sandler&#x27;s deal with Netflix &quot;means pretty much doing whatever he wants, which, in the case of Spaceman, means traveling to the furthest reaches of space as the near-solitary star of a pretentious, message-heavy drama.&quot; 

You can watch a trailer here. The movie enjoys a &quot;limited theatrical release&quot; this weekend, and will stream on Netflix starting March 1.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this report from Electrek:

Renewable developer Clearway Energy Group has completed a 452-megawatt (MW) solar farm in West Texas — and it&#x27;s huge... It&#x27;s built on around 5,000 acres of land and features over 1.1 million solar panels... Texas Solar Nova will generate enough electricity to power over 190,000 homes annually. 

It&#x27;s got an offtake agreement with telecoms giant Verizon, and agreements with auto component maker Toyota Boshoku and Swedish bearing and seal maker SKF to purchase renewable energy certificates (RECs). Both Toyota Boshoku and SKF have 12-year agreements for RECs. 

The $660 million facility will &quot;contribute significantly to the local tax base,&quot; the company said in a statement, &quot;starting with an estimated $5.4 million in property taxes and wages to be paid in the first year.&quot;

                              <span>A U.S. government auction site was breached by an Oklahoma man, reports NBC News. So when it came time to pay up on his winning bids, he &quot;falsified the true auction price to $1,&quot; according to the U.S. attorney&#x27;s office. 

He defrauded the government out of more than $150,000 between Jan. 31 and March 21, 2019, the indictment alleges. Included in the $1-buys were a 2010 Ford Escape Hybrid, for which Coker submitted a bid of $8,327; a Ford F550 pickup, with a bid of $9,000; and a Chevrolet C4500 box truck, bid $22,700; the U.S. attorney&#x27;s office said... 

Nineteen items in all were bought through the auctions, according to prosecutors. Coker used eight accounts and pre-paid debit cards with very little balances to make the purchases, the indictment says. 

&quot;Coker was indicted on three counts of wire fraud in March 2023 and pleaded guilty to one count Wednesday, according to court records.&quot;

                              <span>In 2019 a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched an Israeli spacecraft carrying a 30-million page archive of human civilization to the moon. Unfortunately, that spacecraft crashed.

But thanks to this week&#x27;s moon landing by the Odysseus, there&#x27;s now a 30-million page &quot;Lunar Library&quot; on the moon — according to a Medium post by the Arch Mission Foundation. 


&quot;This historic moment secures humanity&#x27;s cultural heritage and knowledge in an indestructible archive built to last for up to billions of years.&quot;

Etched onto thin sheets of nickel, called NanoFiche, the Lunar Library is practically indestructible and can withstand the harsh conditions of space... Some of the notable content includes:

                              <span>Since 2010, billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel has offered to pay about 20 students $100,000 to drop out of school each year &quot;to start companies or nonprofits,&quot; reports the Wall Street Journal. His program has now backed 271 people, and this year the applicant pool &quot;is bigger than ever.&quot; 

So how&#x27;s it going?

Some big successes include Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, the blockchain network; Laura Deming, a key figure in venture investing in aging and longevity; Austin Russell, who runs self-driving technologies company Luminar Technologies; and Paul Gu, co-founder of consumer lending company Upstart...

                              <span>&quot;One London resident watched on CCTV as a thief walked up to his £40,000 car and drove away,&quot; reports the Observer. &quot;Now manufacturers say they are being drawn in to a hi-tech &#x27;arms race&#x27; with criminals.&quot;


[H]i-tech devices disguised as handheld games consoles are being traded online for thousands of pounds and are used by organised crime gangs to mimic the electronic key on an Ioniq 5, opening the doors and starting the engine. The device, known as an &quot;emulator&quot;, works by intercepting a signal from the car, which is scanning for the presence of a legitimate key, and sending back a signal to gain access to the vehicle... 

Hyundai says it is looking at measures to prevent the use of emulators &quot;as a priority&quot;. But it is not the only carmaker whose vehicles appear to be vulnerable. An Observer investigation found that models by Toyota, Lexus and Kia have also been targeted... British motorists now face an increase in the number of thefts and rising insurance premiums... Car thefts are at their highest level for a decade in England and Wales, rising from 85,803 vehicles in the year to March 2012 to 130,270 in the year to March 2023 — an increase of more than 50%. Part of the reason, say experts, is the rise of keyless entry... 

Kia did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Toyota, which owns Lexus, said: &quot;Toyota and Lexus are continuously working on developing technical solutions to make vehicles more secure. Since introducing enhanced security hardware on the latest versions of a number of models, we have seen a significant drop-off in thefts. For older models we are currently developing solutions.&quot; 

Another common attack requires entry to the vehicle first, according to the article, but then uses the vehicle&#x27;s onboard diagnostic port to program &quot;a new key linked to the vehicle...&quot; 

&quot;Many owners of Ioniq 5s, which sell from around £42,000, now use steering locks to deter thieves.&quot;

Dangerously easy, you might say, if you were in Apple’s shoes. But it’s all down to how deep you’re mired in the platform services soup.
I used to be all-in on the Apple software story. Apple Mail, Apple Calendar, Apple Notes, Apple Photos, iMessage, Apple Just-About-Everything. It’s really hard to switch from iPhone to Android when that’s the case. But it’s surprisingly easy to make that not the case, and then switching becomes trivial.
For me, HEY delivered two easy outs on the key apps I use on a phone: Email + Calendar. With the HEY combo now packing both, there was literally zero lock-in on that front hopping from an iPhone 15 Pro to a Samsung S…</span>

                              <span>I’m kinda shocked. Windows actually got good for web developers. Between VSCode, WSL, and Intel’s latest desktop chips, I’ve been living with a PC for over a week that runs my programming tests faster than an M3 Max, ships with an excellent window manager out-the-box, and generally feels like a completely viable alternative to macOS for working with the web.
Hell, not just viable, but better in many regards. WSL lets you run a real Linux distribution natively, so you can use the same package manager that you’ll deploy against. Oh, and since it’s x86, you’ll be building Docker images for your server hardware in a fraction of the time it takes to multi-arch on arm64.
Now it’s true that to get this kind of speed, you need to rock a desktop machine. The Dell I got had an Intel i9-14900K, which…</span>

  The view from Cupertino.

The DMA requires Apple to open the iPhone to competing app stores, and and its lopsided proposal for &quot;enabling&quot; them is getting most of the press. But Apple knows it has native stores right where it wants them. Cupertino&#x27;s noxious requirements will take years to litigate. Meanwhile, potential competitors are only that.
But Cupertino can&#x27;t delay the DMA&#x27;s other mandate: real browsers, downloaded from Apple&#x27;s own app store. S…</span>

                              <span>&quot;If you drive a car in California, you may be in for a payday thanks to a lawsuit alleging privacy violations by a Texas company,&quot; report SFGate:

The 2021 lawsuit, given class-action status in September, alleges that Digital Recognition Network is breaking a California law meant to regulate the use of automatic license plate readers. DRN, a Fort Worth-based company, uses plate-scanning cameras to create location data for people&#x27;s vehicles, then sells that data to marketers, car repossessors and insurers. 

What&#x27;s particularly notable about the case is the size of the class. The court has established that if you&#x27;re a California resident whose license plate data was collected by DRN at least 15 times since June 2017, you&#x27;re a class member. The plaintiff&#x27;s legal team estimates that the tally includes about 23 million people, alleging that DRN cameras were mounted to cars on public roads. The case website lets Californians check whether their plates were scanned. 

Barring a settlement or delay, the trial to decide whether DRN must pay a penalty to those class members will begin on May 17 in San Diego County Superior Court...

The company&#x27;s cameras scan 220 million plates a month, its website says, and customers can use plate data to &quot;create comprehensive vehicle stories.&quot;
 
A lawyer for the firm representing class members told SFGATE Friday that his team will try to show DRN&#x27;s business is a &quot;mass surveillance program.&quot;

                              <span>On Wednesday Boeing &quot;removed executive Ed Clark, the head of its 737 Max passenger jet program,&quot; reports CNN, &quot;after a dramatic — and terrifying — midair blowout in January underscored ongoing problems with the jet.&quot;


 A preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board found that the four bolts that should have held the door plug in place were missing when the plane left Boeing&#x27;s factory. The NTSB report did not assess blame for the missing bolts and the accident but in a statement to investors before the findings were released, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun assumed responsibility for the incident. &quot;We caused the problem, and we understand that,&quot; he told investors during a call after reporting the latest quarterly loss at the company. &quot;Whatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened.&quot; 

 Clark, who had been at Boeing for 18 years, had only been in charge of the Max program since March of 2021, assuming that title after the jets had been returned to service following the crashes. But he had previously held roles related to the 737 Max, including as chief engineer and chief 737 mechanic. 

With the news of Clark&#x27;s departure, Boeing also announced a shuffling of a number of executives in its Boeing Commercial Airplanes unit. It created a new executive position, Senior Vice President for BCA Quality, and named Elizabeth Lund to that position.

                              <span>The Guardian reports:
The Covid death toll in the U.S. is likely at least 16% higher than the official tally, according to a new study, and researchers believe the cause of the undercounting goes beyond overloaded health systems to a lack of awareness of Covid and low levels of testing. 

The second year of the pandemic also had nearly as many uncounted excess deaths as the first, the study found. 

More than 1.1 million Americans have died from Covid, according to official records. But the actual number is assuredly higher, given the high rates of excess deaths. Demographers wanted to know how many could be attributed to Covid, and they drilled down to data at the county level to discover patterns in geography and time. There were 1.2 million excess deaths from natural causes — excluding …</span>

                              <span>TechTarget notes it was Linkerd&#x27;s original developers who coined the term &quot;service mesh&quot; — describing their infrastructure layer for communication between microservices. 

But &quot;There has to be some way of connecting the businesses that are being built on top of Linkerd back to funding the project,&quot; argues Buoyant CEO William Morgan. &quot;If we don&#x27;t do that, then there&#x27;s no way for us to evolve this project and to grow it in the way that I think we all want.&quot; 
And so, TechTarget reports...
Beginning May 21, 2024, any company with more than 50 employees running Linkerd in production must pay Buoyant $2,000 per Kubernetes cluster per month to access stable releases of the project... 

The project&#x27;s overall source code will remain available in GitHub, and edge, or experimental early releases of c…</span>

                              <span>&quot;Crypto mines will have to start reporting their energy use in the U.S.,&quot; wrote the Verge in January, saying America&#x27;s Energy department would &quot;begin collecting data on crypto mines&#x27; electricity use, following criticism from environmental advocates over how energy-hungry those operations are.&quot; 

But then &quot;constitutional freedoms&quot; group New Civil Liberties Alliance (founded with seed money from the Charles Koch Foundation) objected. And &quot;on behalf of its clients&quot; — the Texas Blockchain Council and Colorado bitcoin mining company Riot Platforms — the group said it &quot;looks forward to derailing the Department of Energy&#x27;s unlawful data collection effort once and for all.&quot; 

While America&#x27;s Energy department said the survey would take 30 minutes to complete, the complaint argued it would take 40 …</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this report from CNN:


Dynabook Americas, the company formerly known as Toshiba, has recalled 15.5 million Toshiba laptop AC adapters over potential burn and fire hazards. 

The company said it received 679 reports of the recalled AC adapters overheating or catching on fire, melting and burning, including 43 reports of minor burn injuries. Consumers should stop using the adapters immediately and contact them for a free replacement, Dynabook Americas said. 

The recall applies to AC adapters sold both alongside Toshiba personal laptop computers and sold separately, with date codes ranging between April 2008 through December 2012. The adapters were manufactured in China. More than 60 models are part of the recall. The company published a webpage listing the impacted model numbers and serial numbers for the adapters. 
Gatner points out the adapters are for &quot;very old models,&quot; so &quot;it&#x27;s only a very small percentage of the population that is still using them.&quot; 
The article cites figures from Gartner showing that while Toshiba once led the laptop market, it now makes up about 1%. &quot;Nowadays, Lenovo dominates the category with 25%, followed by HP (22%), Dell (17%) and Apple (9%).&quot;

                              <span>Stack Overflow&#x27;s blog reports on a new programming language called Mariposa. 

They call it a &quot;toy&quot; programming language, &quot;created as a way to play around with a novel or odd feature, like variable assignment outside of the normal order of execution — more colloquially, time travel.&quot;


Computer science has long sought to reason about time in electronic systems, thanks to a consistent interest in concurrency and real-time messaging... Mariposa allows you to manipulate the order of execution by assigning an instant to a variable, then setting the context of that instance. Here&#x27;s a basic example, taken from the Mariposa readme: 

x &#x3D; 1
t &#x3D; now()
print(x)
at t:
 x &#x3D; 2
 

According to the normal order of operations, this code should print &quot;1&quot;. But because t is assigned to the instance in the second line, any modifications specified within an at t: block are applied immediately, and this code prints &quot;2&quot;... 

While Mariposa caught a fair amount of attention recently, it&#x27;s not the first implementation of time travel in programming. There is a Haskell package appropriately called tardis, which creates two state transformers: one travels forward in time and one backward. As the docs explain, &quot;The most concise way to explain it is this: getPast retrieves the value from the latest sendFuture, while getFuture retrieves the value from the next sendPast.&quot; One function&#x27;s past is another one&#x27;s future. 

The article explores &quot;the history and future of other programming paradigms&quot; applying logic to time, including interval temporal logic systems as well as &quot;modeling, analysis, and verification languages/tools that allow temporal and state modeling without requiring temporal logic understanding.&quot;

The agency&#x27;s Space Debris Office, along with an international surveillance network, monitored and tracked the Earth-observing ERS-2 satellite throughout February to make predictions about the reentry, which occurred at 12:17 p.m. ET Wednesday. The ESA provided continuous live updates on its website. At around 50 miles (80 kilometers) above Earth&#x27;s surface, the satellite broke apart due to atmospheric drag, and the majority of the fragments were expected to burn up in the atmosphere. 

The agency said it was possible that some fragments could reach the planet&#x27;s surface, but the pieces didn&#x27;t…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: In a press release written with help from ChatGPT, Match Group announced an enterprise agreement with the AI chatbot&#x27;s maker, OpenAI. The new agreement includes over 1,000 enterprise licenses for the dating app giant and home to Tinder, Match, OkCupid, Hinge and others. The AI tech will be used to help Match Group employees with work-related tasks, the company says, and come as part of Match&#x27;s $20 million-plus bet on AI in 2024. [...] As for the news itself, Match Group says it will begin using the AI tech, and specifically ChatGPT-4, to aid with coding, design, analysis, build templates, and other daily tasks, including, as you can tell, communications. To keep its corporate data protected, only trained and licensed Match Group employees will have access to OpenAI&#x27;s tools, it noted.
 
Before being able to use these tools, Match Group employees will also have to undergo mandatory training that focuses on responsible use, the technology&#x27;s capabilities, as well as its limitations. The use will be guided by the company&#x27;s existing privacy practices and AI principles, too. The company declined to share the cost of the agreement or how it will impact the tech giant&#x27;s bottom line, but Match believes that the AI tools will make teams more productive. Match execs recently spoke of the company&#x27;s plans for AI during the company&#x27;s fourth-quarter earnings, noting that, this year, the app maker will use AI technology to both evolve its existing products and build new ones. The company&#x27;s Shareholder letter explained how AI could help to improve various aspects of the dating app journey. For instance, it could help with profile creation, where Match is testing features like an AI-powered photo picker, and generative AI for help making bios. The company said that AI will also improve its matching abilities and post-match guidance, in areas like conversation starters, nudges, and offering date ideas.

                              <span>On Thursday, the Odysseus Moon lander made history by becoming the first ever privately built and operated robot to complete a soft lunar touchdown. While the lander is &quot;alive and well,&quot; the CEO of Houston-based Intuitive Machines, which built and flew the lander, said it tipped over during its final descent, coming up to rest propped up sideways on a rock. The BBC reports: Its owner, Texan firm Intuitive Machines, says Odysseus has plenty of power and is communicating with Earth. Controllers are trying to retrieve pictures from the robot. Steve Altemus, the CEO and co-founder of IM, said it wasn&#x27;t totally clear what happened but the data suggested the robot caught a foot on the surface and then fell because it still had some lateral motion at the moment of landing. All the scientific instruments that planned to take observations on the Moon are on the side of Odysseus that should still allow them to do some work. The only payload likely on the &quot;wrong side&quot; of the lander, pointing down at the lunar surface, is an art project.
 
&quot;We&#x27;re hopeful to get pictures and really do an assessment of the structure and assessment of all the external equipment,&quot; Mr Altemus told reporters.
&quot;So far, we have quite a bit of operational capability even though we&#x27;re tipped over. And so that&#x27;s really exciting for us, and we are continuing the surface operations mission as a result of it.&quot; The robot had been directed to a cratered terrain near the Moon&#x27;s south pole, and the IM team believes it got very close to the targeted site - perhaps within a couple of kilometers. A US space agency satellite called the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter will search for Odysseus in the coming days.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Guardian: Air pollution from traffic is linked to some of the more severe forms of dementia, and could be a significant cause of the condition among those who are not already genetically predisposed to it, research suggests. Research carried out in Atlanta, Georgia, found that people with higher exposure to traffic-related fine particulate matter air pollution were more likely to have high amounts of the amyloid plaques in their brains that are associated with Alzheimer&#x27;s. The findings, which will alarm anyone living in a town or city, but particularly those living near busy roads, add to the harms already known to be caused by road traffic pollution, ranging from climate change to respiratory diseases.

                              <span>Microplastics have been found in sediment layers that date back as early as the first half of the 1700s, &quot;showing microplastics&#x27; pernicious ability to infiltrate even environments untouched by modern humans,&quot; reports Futurism. From the report: A team of European researchers made this alarming discovery after studying the sediment layers at three lakes in Latvia, as detailed in a study published in the journal Science Advances. The scientists were studying lake sediment to test if the presence of microplastics in geological layers would be a reliable indicator for the beginning of the Anthropocene Epoch, defined in the study as starting in 1950 and meant to delineate when humans started having a large impact on our environment.
 
Scientists have long used layers of ash or ice to study past events on Earth, leading to the question of whether microplastics can serve as a reliable chronological marker for the Anthropocene. Clearly not, according to this new research, which found microplastics in every layer of sediment they dredged up, including one from 1733. &quot;We conclude that interpretation of microplastics distribution in the studied sediment profiles is ambiguous and does not strictly indicate the beginning of the Anthropocene Epoch,&quot; the scientists wrote.

                              <span>Florida lawmakers passed a bill on Thursday that forces social media companies to keep most minors off their platforms. The Hill reports: The legislation, which passed the state House Thursday after earlier being approved by the Senate, now heads to Gov. Ron DeSantis&#x27;s (R) desk, though he says he&#x27;s not quite ready to sign on. DeSantis told reporters Friday that he thinks there needs to be a &quot;proper balance&quot; between government regulations and parental input on the social media issue. &quot;We&#x27;ll be wrestling with that,&quot; he said. The governor said he&#x27;ll be assessing the final version of the legislation likely through the weekend. &quot;Federal law says 13 and under can&#x27;t have social media accounts. That&#x27;s not really enforced,&quot; he said.
 
The lawmakers who championed the proposed social media ban, which would require platforms check the ages of users through a third-party source, argue it will make the online landscape safer for youths. The legislation passed 108-7 in the state House and 23-14 in the Florida Senate within a matter of hours Thursday.

                              <span>Tom McKay successfully masqueraded as a &quot;Slackbot&quot; on Slack after leaving Gizmodo in 2022, going unnoticed by the site&#x27;s management for several months. The Verge reports: If you&#x27;re not glued to Slack for most of the day like I am, then you might not know that Slackbot is the friendly robot that lives in the messaging service. It helps you do things like set reminders, find out your office&#x27;s Wi-Fi password, or let you know when you&#x27;ve been mentioned in a channel that you&#x27;re not a part of. When it was his time to leave, McKay swapped out his existing profile picture for one that resembled an angrier version of Slackbot&#x27;s actual icon. He also changed his name to &quot;Slackbot.&quot; You can&#x27;t just change your name on Slack to &quot;Slackbot,&quot; by the way, as the service will tell you that name&#x27;s already been taken. It does work if you use a special character that resembles one of the letters inside Slackbot, though, such as replacing &quot;o&quot; with the Unicode character &quot;o.&quot;
 
The move camouflaged McKay&#x27;s active Slack account for months, letting his account evade deletion. It also allowed him to send bot-like messages to his colleagues such as, &quot;Slackbot fact of the day: Hi, I&#x27;m Slackbot! That&#x27;s a fact. Have a Slack-ly day!&quot; My colleague Victoria Song, who previously worked at Gizmodo, isn&#x27;t all that surprised that this situation unfolded, and says, &quot;As Tom&#x27;s former coworker and a G/O Media survivor, this tracks.&quot;

It could also worsen the global chip shortage by spiking semiconductor industry costs at a time when many governments worldwide are investing heavily in expanding domestic chip supplies in efforts to keep up with rapidly advancing technologies.
 
Early next week, world leaders will convene at a World Trade Organization (WTO) meeting, just before the deadline to extend the moratorium hits in March. In place since 1998, the moratorium has been renewed every two years since -- but India has grown concerned …</span>

                              <span>Kalyeena Makortoff reports via The Guardian: US regulators have accused a man of making $1.8 million by trading on confidential information he overheard while his wife was on a remote call, in a case that could fuel arguments against working from home. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it charged Tyler Loudon with insider trading after he &quot;took advantage of his remote working conditions&quot; and profited from private information related to the oil firm BP&#x27;s plans to buy an Ohio-based travel centre and truck-stop business last year.
 
The SEC claims that Loudon, who is based in Houston, Texas, listened in on several remote calls held by his wife, a BP merger and acquisitions manager who had been working on the planned deal in a home office 20ft (6 meters) away. The regulator said Loudon went on a buying spree, purchasing more than 46,000 shares in the takeover target, TravelCenters of America, without his wife&#x27;s knowledge, weeks before the deal was announced on 16 February 2023. TravelCenters&#x27;s stock soared by nearly 71% after the deal was announced. Loudon then sold off all of his shares, making a $1.8m profit.
 
Loudon eventually confessed to his wife, and claimed that he had bought the shares because he wanted to make enough money so that she did not have to work long hours anymore. She reported his dealings to her bosses at BP, which later fired her despite having no evidence that she knowingly leaked information to her husband. She eventually moved out of the couple&#x27;s home and filed for divorce.

                              <span>Google is shutting down the Google Pay app, as the standalone app has largely been replaced by Google Wallet. According to TechCrunch, Google Pay &quot;will only be available in Singapore and India&quot; after its shuts down in the United States. From the report: Users can continue to access the app&#x27;s most popular features right from Google Wallet, which Google says is used five times more than the Google Pay app in the United States. After June 4, users will no longer be able to send, request or receive money through the U.S. version of the Google Pay app. Users have until that date to view and transfer their Google Pay balance to their bank account via the app. If you still have funds in your account after that date, you can view and transfer your funds to your bank from the Google Pay website.
 
Users who used the Google Pay app to find offers and deals can still so do using the new deals destination on Google Search, the company says. Google Wallet is the company&#x27;s primary place for mobile payments in the United States, and will likely remain so. The app lets you use your phone to pay in stores, board a plane, ride transit, store loyalty cards, save driver&#x27;s licenses and start your car via a digital key.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from the Hollywood Reporter: Over the past four years, Tyler Perry had been planning an $800 million expansion of his studio in Atlanta, which would have added 12 soundstages to the 330-acre property. Now, however, those ambitions are on hold -- thanks to the rapid developments he&#x27;s seeing in the realm of artificial intelligence, including OpenAI&#x27;s text-to-video model Sora, which debuted Feb. 15 and stunned observers with its cinematic video outputs. &quot;Being told that it can do all of these things is one thing, but actually seeing the capabilities, it was mind-blowing,&quot; he said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter on Thursday, noting that his productions might not have to travel to locations or build sets with the assistance of the technology.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Beware the apes, Reddit told the world in its IPO documents, though not in such explicit terms. Put simply, the company warned potential investors that one of its subreddits, the infamous r/WallStreetBets, could make its stock price and volume extremely volatile -- and there&#x27;s little Reddit can do about it. Reddit listed r/WallStreetBets as one of the possible risks to investing in the company in its S-1 form on Thursday, referencing the subreddit&#x27;s role in the meme stock craze of 2021, where retail investors banded together to raise the price of struggling companies like GameStop and AMC. The goal of r/WallStreetBets back then was to screw over professional investors on Wall Street and make them lose money for betting against certain companies. 

It&#x27;s entirely possible that the everyday people on r/WallStreetBets, a subreddit of 15 million retail investors who refer to themselves as &quot;apes&quot; and &quot;degenerates,&quot; and other online forums could do the same thing with Reddit&#x27;s stock, the company stated. Reddit writes: &quot;Given the broad awareness and brand recognition of Reddit, including as a result of the popularity of r/ wallstreetbets among retail investors, and the direct access by retail investors to broadly available trading platforms, the market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could experience extreme volatility for reasons unrelated to our underlying business or macroeconomic or industry fundamentals.&quot; 

The volatility could cause people to lose all or part of their investment, the company explained, if they are unable to sell their shares at or above the IPO price. The long-term effect of movements like those propelled by r/WallStreetBets is already documented, with the takeaway being that surges of interest and heavy investment don&#x27;t necessarily bring success to companies over time.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Vision Pro owners are posting near-identical reports of a crack appearing on the front glass of their headsets. None of them seem to know how it happened, either. The issue was first spotted by MacRumors, and so far, there have been five separate Redditors who have posted about it in the r/VisionPro subreddit. Engadget also reported that the same happened with its review unit. 

What makes it curious is that all of the uploaded pictures appear to show vertical hairline cracks in the same exact area above the nose bridge. All the affected Redditors say they didn&#x27;t do anything obvious to cause the cracks, like dropping the device or storing it improperly. Reddit user @dornbirn claims that they polished the front glass, placed the soft cover on, packed it away in the case, and woke up to see the crack the next morning. Most of the other affected Redditors also noted they either stored their Vision Pros in cases or placed the soft cover on.

                              <span>Dell&#x27;s &quot;return to office&quot; mandate has left employees confused about which offices they can use and the future of their jobs -- and concerned the initiative is a stealth layoff program that will disproportionately harm women at the IT giant. From a report: As El Reg broke this month, Dell told employees they each needed to choose between resuming a hybrid work schedule -- working from a corporate office part of the time -- or continue working remotely. Those who chose to remain as remote workers were effectively making a career-limiting decision. 

The implications of choosing to work remotely, we&#x27;re told, are: &quot;1) no funding for team onsite meetings, even if a large portion of the team is flying in for the meeting from other Dell locations; 2) no career advancement; 3) no career movements; and 4) remote status will be considered when planning or organization changes -- AKA workforce reductions.&quot; Another employee said: &quot;Choosing to be remote does indeed put career advancement at a standstill. If you choose to accept a promotion after going remote, that comes with the requirement of being in office 39 days out of the quarter&quot; and you have to reclassify yourself as hybrid. The employee continued: &quot;Even if you choose to make a lateral career move, the same expectation applies. In-role promotions are possible, but rare enough to not be a realistic option.&quot;

                              <span>Tech companies are famous for coddling their workers, but after mass layoffs the industry&#x27;s culture has shifted. Engineers say that getting hired can require days of work on unpaid assignments. From a report: Nearly a dozen engineers, hiring managers, and entrepreneurs who spoke with WIRED describe an environment in which technical job applicants are being put through the wringer. Take-home coding tests used to be rare, deployed only if an employer needed to be further convinced. Now interviewees are regularly given projects described as requiring just two to three hours that instead take days of work. 

Live-coding exercises are also more intense, industry insiders say. One job seeker described an experience where an engineering manager said during an interview, &quot;OK, we&#x27;re going to build a To Do List app right now,&quot; a process that might normally take weeks. 

Emails reviewed by WIRED showed that in one interview for an engineering role at Netflix, a technical recruiter requested that a job candidate submit a three-page project evaluation within 48 hours -- all before the first round of interviews. A Netflix spokesperson said the process is different for each role and otherwise declined to comment. A similar email at Snap outlined a six-part interview process for a potential engineering candidate, with each part lasting an hour. A company spokesperson says its interview process hasn&#x27;t changed as a result of labor market changes.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: News publishers are worried -- with good reason -- about changes coming to Google Search. AI-generated content replacing links on some of the most valuable space on the internet, in particular, has left media types with a lot of questions, starting with &quot;is this going to be a traffic-destroying nightmare?&quot; The News filter disappearing from Google search results for some users this week won&#x27;t help publishers sleep any easier. Google confirmed some users were not seeing the News filter as part of ongoing testing. &quot;We&#x27;re testing different ways to show filters on Search and as a result, a small subset of users were temporarily unable to access some of them,&quot; a Google spokesperson confirmed via email.

                              <span>Two days after an international team of authorities struck a major blow to LockBit, one of the Internet&#x27;s most prolific ransomware syndicates, researchers have detected a new round of attacks that are installing malware associated with the group. From a report: The attacks, detected in the past 24 hours, are exploiting two critical vulnerabilities in ScreenConnect, a remote desktop application sold by Connectwise. According to researchers at two security firms -- SophosXOps and Huntress -- attackers who successfully exploit the vulnerabilities go on to install LockBit ransomware and other post-exploit malware. It wasn&#x27;t immediately clear if the ransomware was the official LockBit version. 

&quot;We can&#x27;t publicly name the customers at this time but can confirm the malware being deployed is associated with LockBit, which is particularly interesting against the backdrop of the recent LockBit takedown,&quot; John Hammond, principal security researcher at Huntress, wrote in an email. &quot;While we can&#x27;t attribute this directly to the larger LockBit group, it is clear that LockBit has a large reach that spans tooling, various affiliate groups, and offshoots that have not been completely erased even with the major takedown by law enforcement.&quot; Hammond said the ransomware is being deployed to &quot;vet offices, health clinics, and local governments (including attacks against systems related to 911 systems).&quot; Further reading: US Offers Up To $15 Million For Information on LockBit Leaders.

On the plus side, the company says it&#x27;ll now throw in three months of its pricy $24-a-month subscription for free with the $699 pin -- and will do so for any other customers who buy one before March 31st, too.

                              <span>Three top-tier X-class solar flares launched off the sun between Wednesday and Thursday. The first two occurred seven hours apart, coming in at X1.9 and X1.6 magnitude respectively. The third, the most powerful of the current 11-year &quot;solar cycle,&quot; ranked an impressive X6.3. From a report: Solar flares, or bursts of radiation, are ranked on a scale that goes from A, B and C to M and X, in increasing order of intensity. They usually originate from sunspots, or bruiselike discolorations on the surface of the sun. Sunspots are most common near the height of the 11-year solar cycle. The current cycle, number 25, is expected to reach its peak this year. The more sunspots, the more opportunities for solar flares.

                              <span>Nvidia hit $2 trillion in market value on Friday, riding on an insatiable demand for its chips that made the Silicon Valley firm the pioneer of the generative AI boom. From a report: The milestone followed another bumper revenue forecast from the chip designer that drove up its market value by $277 billion on Thursday - Wall Street&#x27;s largest one-day gain on record. Its rapid ascent in the past year has led analysts to draw parallels to the picks and shovels providers during the gold rush of 1800s as Nvidia&#x27;s chips are used by almost all generative AI players from chatGPT-maker OpenAI to Google.

                              <span>Bruce66423 writes: The data watchdog has ordered a leisure centre group to stop using facial recognition tech to monitor its staff. The Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office (ICO) says Serco Leisure has been unlawfully processing the biometric data of more than 2,000 employees at 38 UK leisure facilities. It did so to check staff attendance - a practice the ICO said was &quot;neither fair nor proportionate.&quot; 

Serco Leisure says it will comply with the enforcement notice. But it added it had taken legal advice prior to installing the cameras, and said staff had not complained about them during the five years they had been in place. The firm said it was to &quot;make clocking-in and out easier and simpler&quot; for workers. &quot;We engaged with our team members in advance of its roll-out and its introduction was well-received by colleagues,&quot; the company said in a statement.

                              <span>The first privately built spacecraft has successfully landed on the lunar surface on Thursday. &quot;We can confirm, without a doubt, that our equipment is on the surface of the moon,&quot; said Stephen Altemus, CEO of Intuitive Machines, the Houston-based company that operated the Odysseus spacecraft. &quot;Welcome to the moon.&quot; From a report: As it approached the surface of the moon, Odysseus lost contact with NASA, resulting in several anxious minutes for those who worked on the joint project. But after approximately 15 minutes of searching, officials confirmed that they were once again receiving signals from the spacecraft. &quot;A commercial lander named Odysseus, powered by a company called Intuitive Machines, launched up on a Space X rocket, carrying a bounty of NASA scientific instruments and bearing the dream of a new adventure, a new adventure in science, innovation and American leadership, well, all of that aced the landing of a lifetime,&quot; NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said after contact had been reestablished. &quot;Today for the first time in more than a half century, the U.S. has returned to the moon.&quot;
 
Altemus had estimated that Odysseus had an 80% chance of successfully landing on the moon, citing previous failed attempts as an advantage. &quot;We&#x27;ve stood on the shoulders of everybody who&#x27;s tried before us,&quot; Altemus said. It was the first American mission to land on the moon since Apollo 17 in 1972 and the first private spacecraft ever to make a soft landing there. While it was a private mission, NASA paid Intuitive Machines $118 million to deliver six instruments to the moon. And the U.S. space agency provided streaming video of the landing.

                              <span>Princeton professor and technology law researcher Jonathan Mayer has been appointed as the Justice Department&#x27;s first chief AI officer. The Verge reports: Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement that appointing an AI officer was important for the department to &quot;keep pace with rapidly evolving scientific and technological developments.&quot; One of Mayer&#x27;s responsibilities will be to build a team of technical and policy experts around cybersecurity and AI. Mayer will also serve as the department&#x27;s chief science and technology advisor and help recruit tech talent.
 
Mayer held technology roles in government before his new Justice Department gig, according to his bio in Princeton&#x27;s Center for Information Technology Policy. He served as an adviser on technology law and policy to Vice President Kamala Harris when she was still in the Senate. Mayer was also the chief technologist in the enforcement office of the Federal Communications Commission.

                              <span>Longtime Slashdot reader Rei writes: In a blog post today, Bluesky, the social media network founded by Jay Graber, announced that they have finally opened to federation. Users can now operate their own PDS (backend) servers. How to do so is discussed on the developers&#x27; blog and a new Discord channel for PDS administrators.
 
As the blog notes, there are key differences between the AT Protocol/Bluesky federation and ActivityPub/Mastodon federation, including: global conversation (rather than local-server based with remote content only brought in from follows); a decentralized user account not bound to a specific host; user-composable moderation lists not inherently tied to a specific server, offsetting the need for defederation; user-composable feeds/algorithms, not tied to servers; and full account portability, without the need to be initiated by your server, protecting users from rogue admins or servers that disappear.
 
Despite the difference, a number of projects, such as Bridgy-Fed, plan to bridge Bluesky and Mastodon together, with all of Bluesky appearing as a single Mastodon server on ActivityPub, and Mastodon users being translated to a decentralized identifier (DID) for AT Protocol (atproto) calls.

By a little after 3 pm ET, roughly 11 hours after reports of the outage first emerged, the company said that it had restored service to all impacted customers. &quot;We have restored wireless service to all our affected customers. We sincerely apologize to them,&quot; AT&amp;T said in a statement. The company added that it is &quot;taking steps to ensure our customers do not experience this again in the future.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: British comedian Michael McIntyre has a standard bit in his standup routines concerning the many (many!) slang terms posh British people use to describe being drunk. These include &quot;wellied,&quot; &quot;trousered,&quot; and &quot;ratarsed,&quot; to name a few. McIntyre&#x27;s bit rests on his assertion that pretty much any English word can be modified into a so-called &quot;drunkonym,&quot; bolstered by a few handy examples: &quot;I was utterly gazeboed,&quot; or &quot;I am going to get totally and utterly carparked.&quot; 

It&#x27;s a clever riff that sparked the interest of two German linguists. Christina Sanchez-Stockhammer of Chemnitz University of Technology and Peter Uhrig of FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg decided to draw on their expertise to test McIntyre&#x27;s claim that any word in the English language could be modified to mean &quot;being in a state of high inebriation.&quot; Given their prevalence, &quot;It is highly surprising that drunkonyms are still under-researched from a linguistic perspective,&quot; the authors wrote in their new paper published in the Yearbook of the German Cognitive Linguistics Association. Bonus: the authors included an extensive appendix of 546 English synonyms for &quot;drunk,&quot; drawn from various sources, which makes for entertaining reading. 

There is a long tradition of coming up with colorful expressions for drunkenness in the English language, with the Oxford English Dictionary listing a usage as early as 1382: &quot;merry,&quot; meaning &quot;boisterous or cheerful due to alcohol; slight drunk, tipsy.&quot; Another OED entry from 1630 lists &quot;blinde&quot; (as in blind drunk) as a drunkonym. Even Benjamin Franklin got into the act with his 1737 Drinker&#x27;s Dictionary, listing 288 words and phrases for denoting drunkenness. By 1975, there were more than 353 synonyms for &quot;drunk&quot; listed in that year&#x27;s edition of the Dictionary of American Slang. By 1981, linguist Harry Levine noted 900 terms used as drunkonyms.

                              <span>The Supreme Court&#x27;s conservative majority seemed skeptical Wednesday as the Environmental Protection Agency sought to continue enforcing an anti-air-pollution rule in 11 states while separate legal challenges proceed around the country. From a report: The EPA&#x27;s &quot;good neighbor&quot; rule is intended to restrict smokestack emissions from power plants and other industrial sources that burden downwind areas with smog-causing pollution. Three energy-producing states -- Ohio, Indiana and West Virginia -- challenged the rule, along with the steel industry and other groups, calling it costly and ineffective. The rule is on hold in a dozen states because of the court challenges. 

The Supreme Court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, has increasingly reined in the powers of federal agencies, including the EPA, in recent years. The justices have restricted EPA&#x27;s authority to fight air and water pollution -- including a landmark 2022 ruling that limited EPA&#x27;s authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants that contribute to global warming. The court also shot down a vaccine mandate and blocked President Joe Biden&#x27;s student loan forgiveness program. 

The court is currently weighing whether to overturn its 40-year-old Chevron decision, which has been the basis for upholding a wide range of regulations on public health, workplace safety and consumer protections. A lawyer for the EPA said the &quot;good neighbor&quot; rule was important to protect downwind states that receive unwanted air pollution from other states. Besides the potential health impacts, the states face their own federal deadlines to ensure clean air, said Deputy U.S. Solicitor General Malcolm Stewart, representing the EPA.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: When Google Wallet launched in 2022, Google kept the &quot;GPay&quot; app around in a handful of countries. The company announced today that the old Google Pay app is soon going away in the US. That app, which appears as &quot;GPay&quot; on your Android homescreen, was Google&#x27;s previous vision for mobile payments and finance. 

It was &quot;designed around your relationships with people and businesses&quot; with conversation-like threads serving as a purchase history, while keeping track of your spending was another big aspect. GPay will stop working in the US from June 4, 2024. It will remain available for users in India and Singapore as Google continues to &quot;build for the unique needs in those countries.&quot; As part of the app going away, Google is shutting down peer-to-peer payments that let you send, request, or receive money from others in the US. Google&#x27;s P2P offering never really took off.

                              <span>The U.S. FTC will order Avast to pay $16.5 million and ban the company from selling the users&#x27; web browsing data or licensing it for advertising purposes. From a report: The complaint says Avast violated millions of consumers&#x27; rights by collecting, storing, and selling their browsing data without their knowledge and consent while misleading them that the products used to harvest their data would block online tracking. &quot;While the FTC&#x27;s privacy lawsuits routinely take on firms that misrepresent their data practices, Avast&#x27;s decision to expressly market its products as safeguarding people&#x27;s browsing records and protecting data from tracking only to then sell those records is especially galling,&quot; said FTC Chair Lina M. Khan. 

&quot;Moreover, the volume of data Avast released is staggering: the complaint alleges that by 2020 Jumpshot had amassed &quot;more than eight petabytes of browsing information dating back to 2014.&quot; More specifically, the FTC says UK-based company Avast Limited harvested consumers&#x27; web browsing information without their knowledge or consent using Avast browser extensions and antivirus software since at least 2014.

                              <span>Social media platform Reddit has struck a deal with Google to make its content available for training the search engine giant&#x27;s AI models. Reuters: The contract with Alphabet-owned Google is worth about $60 million per year, according to one of the sources. The deal underscores how Reddit, which is preparing for a high-profile stock market launch, is seeking to generate new revenue amid fierce competition for advertising dollars from the likes of TikTok and Meta Platform&#x27;s Facebook.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: I hate cookbooks without pictures. We eat with our eyes first, as chefs love to say, but what&#x27;s more important to me is that if I&#x27;m making a dish for the first time, I want to see what the final product should look like to know I did it right. It&#x27;s not so much about presentation as it is about knowing that I browned the chicken skin enough. An image of a recipe will not be this useful, I think, if it was AI-generated, and especially so if the fact that the image was AI-generated wasn&#x27;t disclosed by the recipe. That, to my surprise, is exactly the case with thousands of recipes the grocery delivery service Instacart is suggesting to its users. Some of the recipes include unheard of measurements and ingredients that don&#x27;t appear to exist. 

[...] As I was browsing, I noticed that Instacart was offering me recipes that appeared to complement the ingredients I was looking at. The concept doesn&#x27;t make a ton of sense to me -- I&#x27;m going to Instacart for the ingredients I know I need for the food I know I&#x27;m going to make, not for food inspo -- but I had to click on a recipe for &quot;Watermelon Popsicle with Chocolate Chips&quot; because it looked weird in the thumbnail. Since I have eyeballs with optical nerves that are connected to a semi-functioning brain I can tell that the image was generated by AI. To be more specific, I can see that the top corner of the plate doesn&#x27;t match its square shape, that the table-ish looking thing it&#x27;s resting on is made up of jumbled slats (AI is particularly bad at making these series of long, straight lines), and then there are the titular watermelon popsicles, which defy physical reality. They clip into each other like bad 3D models in a video game, one of them to the left appears hollow, and for some reason they are skewered by what appears to be asparagus spears on the bottom end and capped by impossible small watermelon rinds at the top.

                              <span>Windows 11 users still clinging to the past are to be dragged into a bright, 23H2-shaped future by Microsoft, whether they want to or not. From a report: Microsoft has added a notification to its Release Health dashboard warning Windows 11 users that it is time for the beatings automatic upgrades to begin. &quot;We are starting to update eligible Windows 11 devices automatically to version 23H2.&quot; 

As for what eligible means, according to Microsoft, this is &quot;Windows 11 devices that have reached or are approaching end of servicing.&quot; Support for Windows 11 21H2 came to an end last year on October 10, 2023, and version 22H2 is due to end on October 8, 2024. Win 11 23H2 itself will endure until November 11, 2025, or just after the plug gets pulled on Windows 10. The update comes shortly after Microsoft quashed the last of its compatibility holds in Windows 11 23H2, which affected customers attempting to use the Co-pilot preview with multiple monitors. Icons tended to move unexpectedly between monitors.

                              <span>Amazon is pushing back against reports that its Freevee service is shuttering. The Wrap: AdWeek reported the news, which it said is part of an effort by the tech giant to shift its focus to Prime Video. Sources familiar with the matter told the outlet that sunsetting Freevee could happen sometime within the second quarter. However, a spokesperson for Amazon said there are &quot;no changes&quot; coming to Freevee. 

&quot;Amazon Freevee remains an important streaming offering providing both Prime and non-Prime customers thousands of hit movies, shows and originals, all for free,&quot; they added. Freevee, which was formerly known as IMDb TV until a rebrand in 2022, offers thousands of premium movies and TV shows, including originals such as &quot;Bosch: Legacy,&quot; &quot;Judy Justice&quot; and &quot;Jury Duty&quot; and over 150 free ad-supported streaming TV (FAST) channels.

                              <span>A spacecraft containing pharmaceutical drugs that were grown on orbit has finally returned to Earth today after more than eight months in space. From a report: Varda Space Industries&#x27; in-space manufacturing capsule, called Winnebago-1, landed in the Utah desert at around 4:40 p.m. EST. Inside the capsule are crystals of the drug ritonavir, which is used to treat HIV/AIDS. It marks a successful conclusion of Varda&#x27;s first experimental mission to grow pharmaceuticals on orbit, as well as the first time a commercial company has landed a spacecraft on U.S. soil, ever. The capsule will now be sent back to Varda&#x27;s facilities in Los Angeles for analysis, and the vials of ritonavir will be shipped to a research company called Improved Pharma for post-flight characterization, Varda said in a statement. The company will also be sharing all the data collected through the mission with the Air Force and NASA, per existing agreements with those agencies. 

The first-of-its-kind reentry and landing is also a major win for Rocket Lab, which partnered with Varda on the mission. Rocket Lab hosted Varda&#x27;s manufacturing capsule inside its Photon satellite bus; through the course of the mission, Photon provided power, communications, attitude control and other essential operations. At the mission&#x27;s conclusion, the bus executed a series of maneuvers and de-orbit burns that put the miniature drug lab on the proper reentry trajectory. The final engine burn was executed shortly after 4 p.m. EST. Photon burned up in the atmosphere as planned while the capsule, protected by a heat shield and with the aid of a parachute, continued to land.

                              <span>U.S. healthcare technology giant Change Healthcare has confirmed a cyberattack on its systems. In a brief statement, the company said it was &quot;experiencing a network interruption related to a cyber security issue.&quot; From a report: &quot;Once we became aware of the outside threat, in the interest of protecting our partners and patients, we took immediate action to disconnect our systems to prevent further impact,&quot; Change Healthcare wrote on its status page. &quot;The disruption is expected to last at least through the day.&quot; 

The incident began early on Tuesday morning on the U.S. East Coast, according to the incident tracker. The specific nature of the cybersecurity incident was not disclosed. Most of the login pages for Change Healthcare were inaccessible or offline when TechCrunch checked at the time of writing. Michigan local newspaper the Huron Daily Tribune is reporting that local pharmacies are experiencing outages due to the Change Healthcare cyberattack.

                              <span>Google&#x27;s Gemini AI chatbot is under fire for generating historically inaccurate images, particularly when depicting people from different eras and nationalities. Google acknowledges the issue and is actively working to refine Gemini&#x27;s accuracy, emphasizing that while diversity in image generation is valued, adjustments are necessary to meet historical accuracy standards. 9to5Google reports: The Twitter/X post in particular that brought this issue to light showed prompts to Gemini asking for the AI to generate images of Australian, American, British, and German women. All four prompts resulted in images of women with darker skin tones, which, as Google&#x27;s Jack Krawcyczk pointed out, is not incorrect, but may not be what is expected.
 
But a bigger issue that was noticed in the wake of that post was that Gemini also struggles to accurately depict human beings in a historical context, with those being depicted often having darker skin tones or being of particular nationalities that are not historically accurate. Google, in a statement posted to Twitter/X, admits that Gemini AI image generation is &quot;missing the mark&quot; on historical depictions and that the company is working to improve it. Google also does say that the diversity represented in images generated by Gemini is &quot;generally a good thing,&quot; but it&#x27;s clear some fine-tuning needs to happen.

                              <span>In its fourth quarter earnings report today, Nvidia beat Wall Street&#x27;s forecast for earnings and sales, causing shares to rise about 10% in extended trading. CNBC reports: Here&#x27;s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting for the quarter ending in January, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:
 
Earnings per share: $5.16 adjusted vs. $4.64 expected
Revenue: $22.10 billion vs. $20.62 billion expected 
Nvidia said it expected $24.0 billion in sales in the current quarter. Analysts polled by LSEG were looking for $5.00 per share on $22.17 billion in sales. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang addressed investor fears that the company may not be able to keep up this growth or level of sales for the whole year on a call with analysts. &quot;Fundamentally,…</span>

Among the apparent targets of tools provided by the impacted company, I-Soon: ethnicities and dissidents in parts of China that have seen significant anti-government protests, such as Hong Kong or the heavily Muslim region of Xinjiang in China&#x27;s far west.

                              <span>The California Public Utilities Commission&#x27;s Consumer Protection and Enforcement Division (CPED) has suspended Waymo&#x27;s application to expand its robotaxi service in Los Angeles and San Mateo counties, putting &quot;an abrupt halt to the company&#x27;s aspirations to expand where it can operate -- at least until June 2024,&quot; reports TechCrunch. It does not, however, change the autonomous car company&#x27;s ability to commercially operate its fleet in San Francisco. From the report: The CPED said on its website that the application has been suspended for further staff review. The &quot;suspension&quot; of an advice letter is a procedural part of the CPUC&#x27;s standard and robust review process, according to Waymo. San Mateo County Board of Supervisors vice president David J. Canepa took a different stance, however.
 
&quot;Since Waymo has stalled any meaningful discussions on its expansion plans into Silicon Valley, the CPUC has put the brakes on its application to test robotaxi service virtually unfettered both in San Mateo and Los Angeles counties,&quot; Canepa said. &quot;This will provide the opportunity to fully engage the autonomous vehicle maker on our very real public safety concerns that have caused all kinds of dangerous situations for firefighters and police in neighboring San Francisco.&quot;
 
Waymo noted that it has reached out to two dozen government and business organizations as part of its outreach effort, including officials in cities throughout San Mateo County such as Burlingame, Daly City and Foster City, the San Mateo County Sheriff&#x27;s Office and local chambers of commerce. [...] The city of South San Francisco, Los Angeles County Department of Transportation, San Francisco County Transportation Authority, San Mateo County Office of the County Attorney and the San Francisco Taxi Workers Alliance have sent letters opposing the expansion.

                              <span>According to the Wall Street Journal (paywalled), Reddit plans to sell a chunk of its IPO shares to 75,000 of its most loyal users. Reuters reports: It aims to reserve an as-yet-undetermined number of shares for 75,000 of its most prolific so-called redditors when it goes public next month, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.
The users will have the opportunity to buy Reddit shares at its initial public offering (IPO) price before the stock starts trading, a privilege normally reserved only for big investors, the report said. Reddit&#x27;s IPO, which has been in the works for more than three years now, would be the first from a major social media company since Pinterest&#x27;s debut in 2019.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: On Tuesday, ChatGPT users began reporting unexpected outputs from OpenAI&#x27;s AI assistant, flooding the r/ChatGPT Reddit sub with reports of the AI assistant &quot;having a stroke,&quot; &quot;going insane,&quot; &quot;rambling,&quot; and &quot;losing it.&quot; OpenAI has acknowledged the problem and is working on a fix, but the experience serves as a high-profile example of how some people perceive malfunctioning large language models, which are designed to mimic humanlike output. ChatGPT is not alive and does not have a mind to lose, but tugging on human metaphors (called &quot;anthropomorphization&quot;) seems to be the easiest way for most people to describe the unexpected outputs they have been seeing from the AI model. They&#x27;re forced to use those terms because OpenAI doesn&#x27;t share…</span>

                              <span>China&#x27;s tech firms were caught off guard by breakthroughs in generative artificial intelligence. Beijing&#x27;s regulations and a sagging economy aren&#x27;t helping. From a report: In November, a year after ChatGPT&#x27;s release, a relatively unknown Chinese start-up leaped to the top of a leaderboard that judged the abilities of open-source artificial intelligence systems. The Chinese firm, 01.AI, was only eight months old but had deep-pocketed backers and a $1 billion valuation and was founded by a well-known investor and technologist, Kai-Fu Lee. In interviews, Mr. Lee presented his A.I. system as an alternative to options like Meta&#x27;s generative A.I. model, called LLaMA. There was just one twist: Some of the technology in 01.AI&#x27;s system came from LLaMA. Mr. Lee&#x27;s start-up then built on Meta&#x27;s techno…</span>

                              <span>A software error on the part of Firefly Aerospace doomed Lockheed Martin&#x27;s Electronic Steerable Antenna (ESA) demonstrator to a shorter-than-expected orbital life following a botched Alpha launch. From a report: According to Firefly&#x27;s mission update, the error was in the Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) software algorithm, preventing the system from sending the necessary pulse commands to the Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters before the relight of the second stage. The result was that Lockheed&#x27;s payload was left in the wrong orbit, and Firefly&#x27;s engineers were left scratching their heads. 

The launch on December 22, 2023 -- dubbed &quot;Fly the Lightning&quot; -- seemed to go well at first. It was the fourth for the Alpha, and after Firefly finally registered a successful launch a few months earlier in September, initial indications looked good. However, a burn of the second stage to circularize the orbit did not go to plan, and Lockheed&#x27;s satellite was left in the wrong orbit, with little more than weeks remaining until it re-entered the atmosphere. 

As it turned out, the Lockheed team completed their primary mission objectives. The payload was, after all, designed to demonstrate faster on-orbit sensor calibration. Just perhaps not quite that fast. Software issues aboard spacecraft are becoming depressingly commonplace. A recent example was the near disastrous first launch of Boeing&#x27;s CST-100 Starliner, where iffy code could have led, in NASA parlance, to &quot;spacecraft loss.&quot; In a recent interview with The Register, former Voyager scientist Garry Hunt questioned if the commercial spaceflight sector of today would take the same approach to quality as the boffins of the past.

                              <span>It&#x27;s no surprise that the broader tech industry has largely moved away from physical disks to digital subscription-based models. But Microsoft&#x27;s Gaming CEO Phil Spencer says Xbox isn&#x27;t trying to do away with disks just yet -- even though making disk slots could become challenging in the future. From a report: &quot;Our strategy does not hinge on people moving all-digital,&quot; Spencer said in a recent interview with Game File. &quot;Getting rid of physical, that&#x27;s not a strategic thing for us.&quot; While Spencer implied that disk slots have become somewhat old-school at this point, Xbox consoles will continue to offer both disk-compatible and diskless options if gamers still want to choose. Xbox hasn&#x27;t confirmed yet whether the previously leaked diskless Xbox refresh of the Series X console is still coming, though. 

&quot;Gaming consoles themselves have kind of become the last consumer electronic device that has a drive,&quot; Spencer conceded, calling it a &quot;real issue.&quot; Because so few manufacturers are still making physical disk slots, it&#x27;s possible making consoles with them could become cost prohibitive in the future. &quot;When you think about cogs that we&#x27;re going to go put in a console -- and as you have fewer suppliers and fewer buyers -- the cost of the drive does have an impact,&quot; Spencer said.

                              <span>Intel has landed Microsoft as a customer for its made-to-order chip business, marking a key win for an ambitious turnaround effort under Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger. From a report: Microsoft plans to use Intel&#x27;s 18A manufacturing technology to make a forthcoming chip that the software maker designed in-house, the two companies said at an event Wednesday. They didn&#x27;t identify the product, but Microsoft recently announced plans for two homegrown chips: a computer processor and an artificial intelligence accelerator. 

Intel has been seeking to prove it can compete in the foundry market, where companies produce custom chips for clients. It&#x27;s a major shift for the semiconductor pioneer, which once had the world&#x27;s most advanced chipmaking facilities and kept them to itself. These days, Intel is racing to catch up with companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which leads the foundry industry. Microsoft, meanwhile, is looking to secure a steady supply of semiconductors to power its data-center operations -- especially as demand for AI grows. Designing its own chips also lets Microsoft fine-tune the products to its specific needs. &quot;We need a reliable supply of the most advanced, high-performance and high-quality semiconductors,&quot; Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. âoeThat&#x27;s why we are so excited to work with Intel.&quot;

                              <span>Academics have found that the U.S. mortality declines during recessions, with &quot;reductions in air pollution... a quantitatively important mechanism.&quot; Abstract of a paper on National Bureau of Economic Research: We leverage spatial variation in the severity of the Great Recession across the United States to examine its impact on mortality and to explore implications for the welfare consequences of recessions. We estimate that an increase in the unemployment rate of the magnitude of the Great Recession reduces the average, annual age-adjusted mortality rate by 2.3 percent, with effects persisting for at least 10 years. Mortality reductions appear across causes of death and are concentrated in the half of the population with a high school degree or less. We estimate similar percentage reductions in mortality at all ages, with declines in elderly mortality thus responsible for about three-quarters of the total mortality reduction. Recession-induced mortality declines are driven primarily by external effects of reduced aggregate economic activity on mortality, and recession-induced reductions in air pollution appear to be a quantitatively important mechanism. Incorporating our estimates of pro-cyclical mortality into a standard macroeconomics framework substantially reduces the welfare costs of recessions, particularly for people with less education, and at older ages where they may even be welfare-improving.

                              <span>Apple has updated the iPhone 15&#x27;s battery lifespan, noting the new handsets can retain 80 percent of their original charging capacity after 1,000 cycles -- double the company&#x27;s previous estimate -- without any new hardware or software updates. From a report: Not so coincidentally, the change will arrive in time for upcoming EU regulations that will assign an energy grade for phones&#x27; battery longevity. Before today, Apple&#x27;s online support documents quoted iPhone batteries as maintaining 80 percent of their original full charge after 500 cycles. But after the company retested long-term battery health in its 2023 smartphones -- iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max -- it found they can retain 80 percent capacity after at least 1,000 cycles. The company said its support documents will be updated on Tuesday to reflect the new estimate.

                              <span>Apple is rolling out an upgrade to its iMessage texting platform to defend against future encryption-breaking technologies. From a report: The new protocol, known as PQ3, is another sign that U.S. tech firms are bracing for a potential future breakthrough in quantum computing that could make current methods of protecting users&#x27; communications obsolete. &quot;More than simply replacing an existing algorithm with a new one, we rebuilt the iMessage cryptographic protocol from the ground up,&quot; an Apple blog post published on Wednesday reads. &quot;It will fully replace the existing protocol within all supported conversations this year.&quot; 

The Cupertino, California-based iPhone maker says its encryption algorithms are state-of-the-art and that it has found no evidence so far of a successful attack on them. Still, government officials and scientists are concerned that the advent of quantum computers, advanced machines that tap in to the properties of subatomic particles, could suddenly and dramatically weaken those protections. Late last year, a Reuters investigation explored how the United States and China are racing to prepare for that moment, dubbed &quot;Q-Day,&quot; both by pouring money into quantum research and by investing in new encryption standards known as post-quantum cryptography. Washington and Beijing have traded allegations of intercepting massive amounts of encrypted data in preparation for Q-Day, an approach sometimes dubbed &quot;catch now, crack later.&quot; More on Apple&#x27;s security blog.

                              <span>Barely a week after launching the latest iteration of its Gemini models, Google today announced the launch of Gemma, a new family of lightweight open-weight models. From a report: Starting with Gemma 2B and Gemma 7B, these new models were &quot;inspired by Gemini&quot; and are available for commercial and research usage. Google did not provide us with a detailed paper on how these models perform against similar models from Meta and Mistral, for example, and only noted that they are &quot;state-of-the-art.&quot; 

The company did note that these are dense decoder-only models, though, which is the same architecture it used for its Gemini models (and its earlier PaLM models) and that we will see the benchmarks later today on Hugging Face&#x27;s leaderboard. To get started with Gemma, developers can get access to ready-to-use Colab and Kaggle notebooks, as well as integrations with Hugging Face, MaxText and Nvidia&#x27;s NeMo. Once pre-trained and tuned, these models can then run everywhere. While Google highlights that these are open models, it&#x27;s worth noting that they are not open-source. Indeed, in a press briefing ahead of today&#x27;s announcement, Google&#x27;s Janine Banks stressed the company&#x27;s commitment to open source but also noted that Google is very intentional about how it refers to the Gemma models.

                              <span>Internet service provider Cox Communications has been cleared of a $1 billion jury verdict in favor of several major record labels that had accused it of failing to curb user piracy. &quot;The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, ruled on Tuesday that the amount of damages was not justified and that a federal district court should hold a new trial to determine the appropriate amount,&quot; reports Reuters. From the report: A Virginia jury in 2019 found Cox, the largest unit of privately-owned Cox Enterprises, liable for its customers&#x27; violations of over 10,000 copyrights belonging to labels including Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group, and Universal Music Group. The labels&#x27; attorney Matt Oppenheim said that the appeals court &quot;affirmed the jury&#x27;s verdict that Cox is a willful infringer,&quot; and that &quot;the evidence of Cox&#x27;s complete disregard for copyright law and copyright owners has not changed.&quot; &quot;A second jury will get to hear that same compelling evidence, and we fully expect it will render a significant verdict,&quot; Oppenheim said.
 
More than 50 labels teamed up to sue Cox in 2018, in what was seen as a test of the obligations of internet service providers (ISPs) to thwart piracy.
The labels accused Cox of failing to address thousands of infringement notices, cut off access for repeat infringers, or take reasonable measures to deter pirates. Atlanta-based Cox had told the 4th Circuit that upholding the verdict would force ISPs to boot households or businesses based on &quot;isolated and potentially inaccurate allegations,&quot; or require intrusive oversight of customers&#x27; internet usage. Other ISPs, including Charter Communications, Frontier Communications and Astound Broadband, formerly RCN, have also been sued by the record labels.

                              <span>Have you ever been asked &quot;What do you wish you knew then that you know now?&quot;


I have. And I hate the question.


It&#x27;s usually framed in a way that encourages you to pretend to place yourself in the nascent days of your career, or early adulthood. Back when you didn&#x27;t know much, when you were trying to figure things out.


Essentially it&#x27;s asking you which mistakes you wish you didn&#x27;t make. To squint and identify the things you could have bypassed if you were armed with the wisdom of hindsight.


My take? I think you’d have made the same mistakes, and I don’t think you could have avoided anything that happened.


Why? First, it assumes you&#x27;d even listen to your 50 year old self when you were 20. Next it assumes you&#x27;d even be ready and able to accept the advice you didn&#x27;t recognize as relevant. Last it assumes you&#x27;d be able to avoid the things you didn&#x27;t see coming.


I don&#x27;t think you could, would, or should.


Learning is experiencing and doing. It’s not dodging, following, or forgoing.


You had to go through the shit to learn the shit. Sidestepping it would have just landed you in some other shit. And then you&#x27;d have wished you had listened to different advice.


You wouldn’t have your sage advice today if you hadn’t had the stupid experiences then! In fact, answering the question would erase present you from existence. Because if you were different then, you wouldn’t be the you you know now.


Are there mistakes I wish I hadn’t made? One one hand, absolutely — plenty — but on the other hand, I had to make them to be who I am now. There’s no version of me that’s present me today with a different set of events in the past. I like who I am now, even with portions of my past I’m less satisfied with peering through present day goggles.


But it’s a fantasy to think that if I’d just had magical advice from some old dude named me, then I wouldn’t have made those mistakes back then.


Cut yourself some slack.

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is an annual global program organized by Google that aims to bring new contributors to the world of open-source. The program pairs organizations (such as the Rust Project) with contributors (usually students), with the goal of helping the participants make meaningful open-source contributions under the guidance of experienced mentors.
As of today, the organizations that have been accepted into the program have been announced by Google. The GSoC applicants now h…</span>

                              <span>Michael Larabel reports via Phoronix: With Valve&#x27;s release today of the Steam Audio SDK 4.5.2 they have made the software development kit fully open-source under an Apache 2.0 license. Steam Audio 4.5.2 may not sound exciting in the context of a version number but as described in the release announcement is now &quot;the first open source release of the Steam Audio SDK source code.&quot; The rest of this work in this Steam Audio SDK release amounts to bug fixes and other standard changes.
 
In a SteamCommunity.com announcement posted today entitled &quot;Steam Audio Open Source Release,&quot; it notes: &quot;The entire Steam Audio codebase, including both the SDK and all plugins, is now released under the Apache 2.0 license. This allows developers to use Steam Audio in commercial products, and to modify or redistribute it under their own licensing terms without having to include source code. We welcome contributions from developers who would like to fix bugs or add features to Steam Audio.&quot; You can learn more about Steam Audio via the project site.

                              <span>Starting in July, the Vietnamese government will begin collecting biometric information from its citizens when issuing new identification cards. The Register reports: Prime minister Pham Minh Chinh instructed the nation&#x27;s Ministry of Public Security to collect the data in the form of iris scans, voice samples and actual DNA, in accordance with amendments to Vietnam&#x27;s Law on Citizen Identification. The ID cards are issued to anyone over the age of 14 in Vietnam, and are optional for citizens between the ages of 6 and 14, according to a government news report. Amendments to the Law on Citizen Identification that allow collection of biometrics passed on November 27 of last year.
 
The law allows recording of blood type among the DNA-related information that will be contained in a national database to be shared across agencies &quot;to perform their functions and tasks.&quot; The ministry will work with other parts of the government to integrate the identification system into the national database. [...] Vietnam&#x27;s future identity cards will incorporate the functions of health insurance cards, social insurance books, driver&#x27;s licenses, birth certificates, and marriage certificates, as defined by the amendment.
 
As for how the information will be collected, the amendments state: &quot;Biometric information on DNA and voice is collected when voluntarily provided by the people or the agency conducting criminal proceedings or the agency managing the person to whom administrative measures are applied in the process of settling the case according to their functions and duties whether to solicit assessment or collect biometric information on DNA, people&#x27;s voices are shared with identity management agencies for updating and adjusting to the identity database.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Reuters: The European Union will investigate whether ByteDance&#x27;s TikTok breached online content rules aimed at protecting children and ensuring transparent advertising, an official said on Monday, putting the social media platform at risk of a hefty fine. EU industry chief Thierry Breton said he took the decision after analyzing the short video app&#x27;s risk assessment report and its replies to requests for information, confirming a Reuters story. &quot;Today we open an investigation into TikTok over suspected breach of transparency &amp; obligations to protect minors: addictive design &amp; screen time limits, rabbit hole effect, age verification, default privacy settings,&quot; Breton said on X.
 
The European Union&#x27;s Digital Services Act (DSA), which applies to all online platforms since Feb. 17, requires in particular very large online platforms and search engines to do more to tackle illegal online content and risks to public security. TikTok&#x27;s owner, China-based ByteDance, could face fines of up to 6% of its global turnover if TikTok is found guilty of breaching DSA rules. TikTok said it would continue to work with experts and the industry to keep young people on its platform safe and that it looked forward to explaining this work in detail to the European Commission.
 
The European Commission said the investigation will focus on the design of TikTok&#x27;s system, including algorithmic systems which may stimulate behavioral addictions and/or create so-called &#x27;rabbit hole effects&#x27;. It will also probe whether TikTok has put in place appropriate and proportionate measures to ensure a high level of privacy, safety and security for minors. As well as the issue of protecting minors, the Commission is looking at whether TikTok provides a reliable database on advertisements on its platform so that researchers can scrutinize potential online risks.

                              <span>Microsoft is confirming plans to deprecate its Publisher application in 2026. From a report: This writer has fond memories of Microsoft Publisher, which started life in 1991 as a desktop publisher for Windows 3.0. While alternatives existed in the form of Ventura Publisher, Timeworks, and later QuarkXPress, Microsoft Publisher was a useful tool to write newsletters. Unlike Word, Publisher was focused on layout and page design. Though it lacked many of the features of its competitors, it was responsible for some genuinely horrendous designs, and was popular due to its cheap price. 

Despite not finding much favor with professionals, Microsoft Publisher continued to be updated over the years. Microsoft Publisher 97 was the first to turn up in the Microsoft Office suite, and the most recent edition, released in 2021, is available as part of Microsoft 365. However, all good things -- and Publisher -- must come to an end. Microsoft has warned that the end is nigh for its venerable designer. &quot;In October 2026, Microsoft Publisher will reach its end of life,&quot; the company said. &quot;After that time, it will no longer be included in Microsoft 365, and existing on-premises suites will no longer be supported. Until then, support for Publisher will continue, and users can expect the same experience as today.&quot;

                              <span>Medical alarms don&#x27;t have to be louder to be more effective. Scientific American: Beeping alarms in hospitals are a life-or-death matter -- but with so many going off all the time, medical professionals may experience alarm fatigue that impairs care. Researchers now report that changing an alarm&#x27;s sound to incorporate properties of musical instruments can make it more helpful amid the din. Auditory alarms can sound up to 300 times a day per patient in U.S. hospitals, but only a small fraction require immediate action. 

Data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration suggest that alarm fatigue (including when clinicians turned off or forgot to restart alarms) and other alarm-related issues were linked to 566 deaths over five and a half years. After a typical day at the hospital, &quot;I&#x27;d leave…</span>

                              <span>Microsoft is developing a new network card that could improve the performance of its Maia AI server chip and potentially reduce the company&#x27;s reliance on chip designer Nvidia, The Information reported on Tuesday. Reuters: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has tapped Pradeep Sindhu, who co-founded networking gear developer Juniper Networks, to spearhead the network card effort, the report said citing a person with knowledge of the matter. Microsoft acquired Sindhu&#x27;s server chip startup, Fungible, last year. The new network card is similar to Nvidia&#x27;s ConnectX-7 card, which the chip developer sells alongside its graphic processor units (GPUs), the report added. The equipment could take more than a year to develop and, if successful, could lessen the time it takes for OpenAI to train its models on Microsoft servers as well as make the process less expensive, according to the report.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: In a recent support document, Apple states that putting wet devices in a bag of rice could &quot;allow small particles of rice to damage your iPhone,&quot; although it doesn&#x27;t go into further detail. The company also recommended against using other well-known hacks, such as using an external heat source to dry the phone or sticking a cotton swab into the connector. The company&#x27;s warning on rice coincides with those of other repair experts, who have found that the rice hack works slower than simply leaving your iPhone on a counter to dry. Time is crucial in these situations, as the most important thing is to prevent the water from damaging the electronics inside the phone.

                              <span>Encrypted messaging app Signal has launched new feature allowing users to conceal their phone numbers and instead use usernames, in a move aimed at boosting privacy protections long sought by cybersecurity experts and privacy advocates. From a report: Rather than give your phone number to other Signal contacts as the identifier they use to begin a conversation with you, in other words, you can now choose to be discoverable via a chosen handle -- or even to prevent anyone who does have your phone number from finding you on Signal. 

The use of phone numbers has long been perhaps the most persistent criticism of Signal&#x27;s design. These new privacy protections finally offer a fix, says Meredith Whittaker, Signal&#x27;s executive director. &quot;We want to build a communications app that everyone in the world can easily use to connect with anyone else privately. That &#x27;privately&#x27; is really in bold, underlined, in italics,&quot; Whittaker tells WIRED. &quot;So we&#x27;re extremely sympathetic to people who might be using Signal in high-risk environments who say, &#x27;The phone number is really sensitive information, and I don&#x27;t feel comfortable having that disseminated broadly.&#x27;&quot;

                              <span>A trio of Google engineers recently came up with a futuristic way to help anyone who stumbles through presentations on video calls. They propose that when algorithms detect a speaker&#x27;s pulse racing or &quot;umms&quot; lengthening, a generative AI bot that mimics their voice could simply take over. That cutting-edge idea wasn&#x27;t revealed at a big company event or in an academic journal. Instead, it appeared in a 1,500-word post on a little-known, free website called TDCommons.org that Google has quietly owned and funded for nine years. WIRED: Until WIRED received a link to an idea on TDCommons last year and got curious, Google had never spoken with the media about its website. Scrolling through TDCommons, you can read Google&#x27;s latest ideas for coordinating smart home gadgets for better sleep, preserving privacy in mobile search results, and using AI to summarize a person&#x27;s activities from their photo archives. And the submissions aren&#x27;t exclusive to Google; about 150 organizations, including HP, Cisco, and Visa, also have posted inventions to the website. 

The website is a home for ideas that seem potentially valuable but not worth spending tens of thousands of dollars seeking a patent for. By publishing the technical details and establishing &quot;prior art,&quot; Google and other companies can head off future disputes by blocking others from filing patents for similar concepts. Google gives employees a $1,000 bonus for each invention they post to TDCommons -- a tenth of what it awards its patent seekers -- but they also get an immediately shareable link to gloat about otherwise secretive work.

                              <span>Cox, the cable television and internet service provider, convinced a U.S. appeals court to throw out a $1 billion jury verdict in favor of several major record labels that had accused it of failing to curb user piracy, setting the stage for a new trial on the matter. From a report: The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia ruled on Tuesday that the amount of damages was not justified and that a federal district court should hold a new trial to determine the appropriate amount. A Virginia jury in 2019 found Cox, the largest unit of privately owned Cox Enterprises, liable for its customers&#x27; violations of over 10,000 copyrights belonging to labels including Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group, and Universal Music Group. More than 50 labels teamed up to sue Cox in 2018, in what was seen as a test of the obligations of internet service providers (ISPs) to thwart piracy.

Patient is able to move a mouse around the screen by just thinking,&quot; Musk said in a Spaces event on social media platform X. Musk said Neuralink was now trying to get as many mouse button clicks as possible from the patient. The firm successfully implanted a chip on its first human patient last month, after receiving approval for human trial recruitment in September.

                              <span>The brightest known object in the universe, a quasar 500tn times brighter than our sun, was &quot;hiding in plain sight,&quot; researchers say. From a report: Australian scientists spotted a quasar powered by the fastest growing black hole ever discovered. Its mass is about 17bn times that of our solar system&#x27;s sun, and it devours the equivalent of a sun a day. The light from the celestial object travelled for more than 12bn years to reach Earth. Australian National University scientists first spotted it using a 2.3-metre telescope at the university&#x27;s NSW Siding Spring Observatory in Coonabarabran. They then confirmed the find using the European Southern Observatory&#x27;s (ESO&#x27;s) Very Large Telescope, which has a primary mirror of 8 metres. The findings by the ANU researchers, in collaboration with the ESO, the University of Melbourne, and France&#x27;s Sorbonne Universite have been published in Nature Astronomy.

                              <span>Google&#x27;s &quot;Nest Aware&quot; camera subscription is going through another round of price increases. From a report: This time it&#x27;s for international users. There&#x27;s no big announcement or anything, just a smattering of email screenshots from various countries on the Nest subreddit. 9to5Google was nice enough to hunt down a pile of the announcements. Nest Aware is a monthly subscription fee for Google&#x27;s Nest cameras. Nest cameras exclusively store all their video in the cloud, and without the subscription, you aren&#x27;t allowed to record video 24/7. 

There are two sets of subscriptions to keep track of: the current generation subscription for modern cameras and the &quot;first generation Nest Aware&quot; subscription for older cameras. To give you an idea of what we&#x27;re dealing with, in the US, the current free tier only gets you three hours of &quot;event&quot; video -- meaning video triggered by motion detection. Even the basic $8-a-month subscription doesn&#x27;t get you 24/7 recording -- that&#x27;s still only 30 days of event video. The &quot;Nest Aware Plus&quot; subscription, at $15 a month in the US, gets you 10 days of 24/7 video recording. The &quot;first-generation&quot; Nest Aware subscription, which is tied to earlier cameras and isn&#x27;t available for new customers anymore, is doubling in price in Canada. The basic tier of five days of 24/7 video is going from a yearly fee of CA$50 to CA$110 (the first-generation sub has 24/7 video on every tier). Ten days of video is jumping from CA$80 to CA$160, and 30 days is going from CA$110 to CA$220. These are the prices for a single camera; the first-generation subscription will have additional charges for additional cameras. The current Nest Aware subscription for modern cameras is getting jumps that look similar to the US, with Nest Aware Plus, the mid-tier, going from CA$16 to CA $20 per month, and presumably similar raises across the board.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared an news report: Microsoft has fixed an issue where its Edge browser was again misbehaving, this time by automatically importing browsing data and tabs from Chrome without consent. I personally experienced the bug last month, after I rebooted my PC for a regular Windows update and Microsoft Edge automatically opened with the Chrome tabs I was working on before the update. I asked Microsoft repeatedly to explain why this behavior had occurred for myself and many other Windows users, but the company refused to comment. Microsoft has now quietly issued a fix in the latest Microsoft Edge update. 

Here&#x27;s how Microsoft describes the fix: &quot;Edge has a feature that provides an option to import browser data on each launch from other browsers with user consent. This feature&#x27;s state might not have been syncing and displaying correctly across multiple devices. This is fixed.&quot;

                              <span>As you build your business, you&#x27;ll end up delegating plenty.
Much of what you did before is now better done by someone else.
To make more progress, you release your grip and allow.
But there’s one thing you should hold tight and never let go. It’s the thing that should never be delegated.
It’s your voice.
Speak for yourself. Don’t let anyone speak for you. Don’t have someone else Tweet on your behalf. Or write posts under your name. Or take your calls. Or read or respond to your emails.
No assistant. No replacement. No simulation.
How can you take someone at their word when it&#x27;s not their word?
The moment it’s not you to someone on the other end, you’ve lost something you’ll never get back. If they write you, and they don’t get you back, you’ve gone wrong.
Yes it’s more work. But it’s your work, and your obligation. You &#x3D; you is the equation to solve.
Don’t outgrow that.

                              <span>Meizu is quitting the smartphone business. The company, owned by car maker Geely, said AI is the future and will invest &quot;All in AI&quot;. From a report: According to a post on Weibo, the FlymeOS team will be restructured into working on new AI terminal devices that will use globally available LLM (large language model) such as Open AI. Meizu already laid the cornerstones of its multi-terminal experience when it announced Flyme Auto -- an infotainment system for Geely-made vehicles, including Polestar and Lotus, which connects seamlessly with FlymeOS 10 devices, such as the Meizu 20 and Meizu 21 flagships. 

According to Shen Ziyu, Chairman and CEO of Xingji Meizu Group, smartphone users take longer to upgrade -- an average of 51 months, which is more than 4 years. The added companies now offer comparable performance in smoothness, photography, and software features. That&#x27;s why there will be no Meizu 21 Pro, Meizu 22 and Meizu 23 series.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: &quot;The first one, I&#x27;ll be honest, probably took seven or eight hours,&quot; says TJ Gardner. &quot;But the subsequent ones -- Stroke the Beaver, for example -- would have taken about half an hour.&quot; Gardner is the creator of the &quot;Stroke&quot; video games, available to download from the PlayStation Store for $4 a pop. Each one features a different animal -- cats, dogs and hamsters, along with less cuddly creatures such as snakes and fish -- and they all follow the same blueprint. 

When you start the game, an image of the animal appears against a plain blue background. In the top left-hand corner of the screen are the words &quot;Strokes 0.&quot; You press X to stroke the animal. The animal flashes briefly. The number in the corner goes up by 1. After 25 strokes, you are rewarded with a bronze trophy. Keep going until you hit 2,000 strokes, and you will receive a platinum award. That&#x27;s it. There is no animation; there are no sound effects. Just a picture of an animal under a Creative Commons licence from Wikipedia, and some lo-fi acoustic beats looping endlessly in the background. No running, no jumping, no guns, no baddies, no special moves or power-ups or puzzles. Are the Stroke games even video games at all? The Stroke games, launched in September 2022, have been downloaded more than 120,000 times, amassing nearly $350,000 in sales. Sony takes a 30% cut for hosting the game in the PlayStation Store, leaving Gardner with a pre-tax profit of about $240,000.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: In a concession to automakers and labor unions, the Biden administration intends to relax elements of one of its most ambitious strategies to combat climate change, limits on tailpipe emissions that are designed to get Americans to switch from gas-powered cars to electric vehicles, according to three people familiar with the plan. Instead of essentially requiring automakers to rapidly ramp up sales of electric vehicles over the next few years, the administration would give car manufacturers more time [non-paywalled source], with a sharp increase in sales not required until after 2030, these people said. They asked to remain anonymous because the regulation has not been finalized. The administration plans to publish the final rule by early spring. 

The change comes as President Biden faces intense crosswinds as he runs for re-election while trying to confront climate change. He is aiming to cut carbon dioxide emissions from gasoline-powered vehicles, which make up the largest single source of greenhouse gases emitted by the United States. At the same time, Mr. Biden needs cooperation from the auto industry and political support from the unionized auto workers who backed him in 2020 but now worry that an abrupt transition to electric vehicles would cost jobs. Meanwhile, consumer demand has not been what automakers hoped, with potential buyers put off by sticker prices and the relative scarcity of charging stations. The EPA last year proposed the toughest-ever limits on tailpipe emissions. The rules would be so strict, the only way car makers could comply would be to sell a tremendous number of zero-emissions vehicles in a relatively short time frame. The E.P.A. designed the proposed regulations so that 67% of sales of new cars and light-duty trucks would be all-electric by 2032, up from 7.6% in 2023, a radical remaking of the American automobile market.

                              <span>Capital One is buying Discover Financial (non-payalled source) in a deal that would marry two of the largest credit-card companies in the U.S. WSJ: The all-stock deal could be announced Tuesday, according to people familiar with the matter. Discover has a market value of $28 billion, and the takeover would be expected to value it at a premium to that. Buying Discover will give Capital One, a credit-card lender with a market value of a little over $52 billion, a network that would vastly increase its power in the payments ecosystem. 

Card networks are critical to enabling transactions and setting fees that merchants pay when consumers shop with credit cards. Though much smaller than Visa and Mastercard, Discover is one of the few competitors to those companies in the U.S. and it is one of a small number of card issuers that also has a payments network. Capital One, the ninth-largest bank in the country and a major credit-card issuer, uses Visa and Mastercard for most of its cards. The bank plans to switch at least some of its cards to the Discover network, while continuing to use Visa and Mastercard on others. Those larger networks have more merchant acceptance abroad than Discover does.

                              <span>VGC: Nintendo&#x27;s next console could launch later than expected, in early 2025, it&#x27;s claimed. That&#x27;s according to Brazilian journalist Pedro Henrique Lutti Lippe, who claims in a new OX do Controle video that he received the information from five separate sources. According to the sources, they are also working on games targeting Q1 2025, to launch alongside the console itself, which has internally slipped out of a previous 2024 target. 

Eurogamer reports it&#x27;s heard &quot;similar whispers&quot; from industry sources this week, though has not been able to concretely substantiate them. Previously, VGC reported that Nintendo was targeting a launch for its next console in late 2024, per development sources. This was later supported by other outlets.

                              <span>Apple is probably at least 18 months away from launching a second-generation Vision Pro. Based on the early response to the first version, that may be a long time for some people to wait. Bloomberg: Since the Vision Pro debuted on Feb. 2, it&#x27;s become clear that the mixed-reality headset is still a work in progress. Despite the dazzling demos -- and generally positive reviews -- it can be challenging to use on a daily basis. It&#x27;s heavy. The interface doesn&#x27;t always work smoothly. And it&#x27;s hard to forget the fact that you paid $3,500 or more for this experience. Vision Pro loyalists stress that the current model is only the first generation. It will get better in time. Don&#x27;t forget, they say, that the original iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch had their quirks too. If the headset feels too heavy, you&#x27;re wearing it wrong. The narrower-than-expected field of view and glare? That&#x27;s normal. Now, it&#x27;s true that Apple&#x27;s earlier first-generation products had their issues. The initial iPhone couldn&#x27;t connect to 3G networks and lacked the App Store or even the ability to cut and paste. The iPad didn&#x27;t have multitasking. The original Apple Watch was too sluggish and wasn&#x27;t waterproof. But I don&#x27;t think anyone complained that those devices were too cumbersome, an actual pain to use or too expensive to justify keeping. 

[...] Apple isn&#x27;t commenting on the Vision Pro&#x27;s return rate, but data from sources at retail stores suggests that it&#x27;s likely somewhere between average and above average compared with other products -- depending on the location. Some smaller stores are seeing one or two returns per day, but larger locations have seen as many as over eight take-backs in a single day. [...] Based on what I&#x27;ve seen so far, the demos have been effective -- maybe too effective. They sell consumers on an experience that doesn&#x27;t quite exist yet. Some stores are seeing conversion rates after demos as high as 10% to 15%. That&#x27;s an impressive number for a product with the Vision Pro&#x27;s price tag.

                              <span>Founders and investors who moved to Miami and elsewhere are returning to a boom in AI and an abundance of tech talent. From a report: In 2020, venture capitalist Keith Rabois urged startup founders to join him in ditching San Francisco for Miami, praising the city&#x27;s safety, lower taxes and tech-friendly mayor. The self-proclaimed contrarian investor, who made a fortune backing companies such as Airbnb and DoorDash, once tweeted that San Francisco was &quot;miserable on every dimension.&quot; 

The hard pivot to Miami has faltered. Several of the startups that Rabois backed are relocating or opening offices elsewhere to better attract engineering talent. Late last year, he was pushed out of his old venture firm, Founders Fund, after falling out with some colleagues. Now, he plans to spend one week a …</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Wyze&#x27;s problems with letting its security camera customers briefly see into other customer homes is a lot worse than we thought. Last week, co-founder David Crosby said that &quot;so far&quot; the company had identified 14 people who were able to briefly see into a stranger&#x27;s property because they were shown an image from someone else&#x27;s Wyze camera. Now we&#x27;re being told that number of affected customers has ballooned to 13,000. 

The revelation came from an email sent to customers entitled &quot;An Important Security Message from Wyze,&quot; in which the company copped to the breach and apologized, while also attempting to lay some of the blame on its web hosting provider AWS. [...] The breach, however, occurred as Wyze was attempting to bring its cameras back online. Customers were reporting seeing mysterious images and video footage in their own Events tab. Wyze disabled access to the tab and launched its own investigation.

                              <span>The FBI is &quot;laser focused&quot; on Chinese efforts to insert malicious software code into computer networks in ways that could disrupt critical US infrastructure, according to the agency&#x27;s director Christopher Wray. From a report: Wray said he was acutely concerned about &quot;pre-positioning&quot; of malware. He said the US recently disrupted a Chinese hacking network known as Volt Typhoon that targeted American infrastructure including the electricity grid and water supply, and other targets around the world. &quot;We&#x27;re laser focused on this as a real threat and we&#x27;re working with a lot of partners to try to identify it, anticipate it and disrupt it,&quot; Wray said on Sunday after attending the Munich Security Conference. 

&quot;I&#x27;m sober and clear minded about what we&#x27;re up against...We&#x27;re always going to have to be kind of on the balls of our feet.&quot; Wray said Volt Typhoon was just the tip of the iceberg and was one of many such efforts by the Chinese government. The US has been tracking Chinese pre-positioning operations for well over a decade, but Wray told the security conference that they had reached &quot;fever pitch.&quot; He said China was increasingly inserting &quot;offensive weapons within our critical infrastructure poised to attack whenever Beijing decides the time is right.&quot; 

His comments are the latest FBI effort to raise awareness about Chinese espionage that ranges from traditional spying and intellectual property theft to hacking designed to prepare for possible future conflict. Last October, Wray and his counterparts from the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network that includes the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand held their first public meeting in an effort to focus the spotlight on Chinese espionage. Wray said the US campaign was having an impact and that people were increasingly attuned to the threat, particularly compared with several years ago when he sometimes met scepticism.

With Linux 6.8 the kernel&#x27;s Rust code was brought up to Rust 1.75 while new patches posted this weekend port the code over to Rust 1.76 and then the upcoming Rust 1.77... 

With Rust 1.77 they have now stabilized the single-field &quot;offset_of&quot; feature used by the kernel&#x27;s Rust code. Rust 1.77 also adds a &quot;--check-cfg&quot; option that the Rust kernel code will likely transition to in the future. This follows the Rust for Linux policy of tracking the upstream Rust version upgrades until there is a minimum version that can be declared where all used features are considered stable.

                              <span>&quot;After years of rapid expansion, California&#x27;s booming EV market may be showing signs of fatigue,&quot; reports the Los Angeles Times, &quot;as high vehicle prices, unreliable charging networks and other consumer headaches appear to dampen enthusiasm for zero-emission vehicles. 

&quot;For the first time in more than a decade, electric vehicle sales dropped significantly in the last half of 2023...&quot;

Sales of all-electric cars and light trucks in California had started off strong in 2023, rising 48% in the first half of the year compared with a year earlier. By that time, California EV sales numbered roughly 190,807 — or slightly more than a quarter of all EV sales in the nation, according to the California New Car Dealers Assn. But it&#x27;s what happened in the second half of last year though that&#x27;s generati…</span>

                              <span>By 2022 the VC firm Sequoia Capital had about $85 billion in assets under management, according to Wikipedia. Its successful investments include Google, Apple, PayPal, Zoom, and Nvidia. 

And now the VC firm &quot;plans to fund up to three open source software developers annually,&quot; according to TechCrunch, which notes it &quot;a continuation of a program it debuted last year.&quot;
The Silicon Valley venture capital firm announced the Sequoia Open Source Fellowship last May, but it was initially offered on an invite-only basis with a single recipient to shout about so far. Moving forward, Sequoia is inviting developers to apply for a stipend that will cover their costs for up to a year so they can work full-time on the project — without giving up any equity or ownership.... &quot;The open source world is to s…</span>

                              <span>A few years ago, MIT researchers invented a cryptographic ID tag — but like traditional RFID tags, &quot;a counterfeiter could peel the tag off a genuine item and reattach it to a fake,&quot; writes MIT News. 

&quot;The researchers have now surmounted this security vulnerability by leveraging terahertz waves to develop an antitampering ID tag that still offers the benefits of being tiny, cheap, and secure.&quot;

They mix microscopic metal particles into the glue that sticks the tag to an object, and then use terahertz waves to detect the unique pattern those particles form on the item&#x27;s surface. Akin to a fingerprint, this random glue pattern is used to authenticate the item, explains Eunseok Lee, an electrical engineering and computer science (EECS) graduate student and lead author of a paper on the antita…</span>

                              <span>&quot;Apple will reportedly have to pay around €500 million (about $539 million USD) in the EU,&quot; reports the Verge, &quot;for stifling competition against Apple Music on the iPhone.
Financial Times reported this morning that the fine comes after regulators in Brussels, Belgium investigated a Spotify complaint that Apple prevented apps from telling users about cheaper alternatives to Apple&#x27;s music service.... The EU whittled its objections down to oppose Apple&#x27;s refusal to let developers even link out to their own subscription sign-ups within their apps — a policy that Apple changed in 2022 following regulatory pressure in Japan. 

$500 million may sound like a lot, but a much bigger fine of close to $40 billion (or 10 percent of Apple&#x27;s annual global turnover) was on the table when the EU updated its objections last year. Apple was charged over a billion dollars in 2020, but French authorities dropped that to about $366 million after the company appealed. 
The Verge cites an Apple spokesperson who said a year ago that the EU case &quot;has no merit.&quot; 

Reuters that the EU&#x27;s fine &quot;is expected to be announced early next month, the Financial Times said.&quot; 

More from Politico

The fine would be the EU&#x27;s first ever against Apple and is expected to be announced early next month, according to the FT report. It is the result of a European Commission antitrust probe into whether Apple&#x27;s &quot;anti-steering&quot; requirements breach the bloc&#x27;s abuse of dominance rules, harming music consumers &quot;who may end up paying more&quot; for apps... The Commission will rule that Apple&#x27;s actions are illegal and against EU competition rules, according to the report. 
&quot;The EU executive will ban Apple&#x27;s practice of barring music services from letting users know of cheaper alternatives outside the App Store, according to the newspaper.&quot;

The Rust Survey Team is excited to share the results of our 2023 survey on the Rust Programming language, conducted between December 18, 2023 and January 15, 2024.
As in previous years, the 2023 State of Rust Survey was focused on gathering insights and feedback from Rust users, and all those who are interested in the future of Rust more generally.
This eighth edition of the survey surfaced new insights and learning opportunities straight from the global Rust language community, which we will summarize below. In addition to this blog post, this year we have also prepared a report containing charts with aggregated results of all questions in the survey. Based on feedback from recent years, we have also tried to provide more comprehensive and interactive charts in this sum…</span>

Every six months, half of the council terms end.
Since this is the first rotation since the formation of the Council in June 2023, we have chosen the following teams (and their current representatives) to establish who will start this process:
Compiler — Eric Holk
Crates.io — Carol Nichols
Devtools — Eric Huss
Launching Pad — Jonathan Pallant
We are aiming to have the teams confirm their choices by March 22, 2024, and for any possible new members to be ready to join the Council meetings starting March 29th.

And here in 2024, &quot;we can now start reading its contents.&quot;

A worldwide competition to decipher the charred texts of the Villa of Papyri — an ancient Roman mansion destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius — has revealed a timeless infatuation with the pleasures of music, the color purple, and, of course, the zingy taste of capers. The so-called Vesuvius challenge was launched a few years ago by computer scientist Brent Seales at the University of Kentucky with support from Silicon Valley investors. The ongoing &#x27;master plan&#x27; is to build on Seales&#x27; previou…</span>

                              <span>&quot;I feel things fraying,&quot; says Nick Hilton, host of a neo-luddite podcast called The Ned Ludd Radio Hour. 

But he&#x27;s one of the more optimistic tech skeptics interviewed by the Guardian:

Eliezer Yudkowsky, a 44-year-old academic wearing a grey polo shirt, rocks slowly on his office chair and explains with real patience — taking things slowly for a novice like me — that every single person we know and love will soon be dead. They will be murdered by rebellious self-aware machines.... Yudkowsky is the most pessimistic, the least convinced that civilisation has a hope. He is the lead researcher at a nonprofit called the Machine Intelligence Research Institute in Berkeley, California... &quot;If you put me to a wall,&quot; he continues, &quot;and forced me to put probabilities on things, I have a sense that …</span>

                              <span>&quot;For nearly a year now, a bizarre heating event has been unfolding across the world&#x27;s oceans,&quot; reports Wired. 

&quot;In March 2023, global sea surface temperatures started shattering record daily highs and have stayed that way since...&quot;

Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami. &quot;It&#x27;s really getting to be strange that we&#x27;re just seeing the records break by this much, and for this long....&quot; Unlike land, which rapidly heats and cools as day turns to night and back again, it takes a lot to warm up an ocean that may be thousands of feet deep. So even an anomaly of mere fractions of a degree is significant. &quot;To get into the two or three or four degrees, like it is in a few places, it&#x27;s pretty exceptional,&quot; says McNoldy.

                              <span>&quot;Dutch motorist Tim Hansenn was fined 380 euros for using his phone while driving,&quot; reports the Jerusalem Post. &quot;But there was one problem: He wasn&#x27;t using his phone at all...&quot;

Hansenn, who works with AI as part of his job with the firm Nippur, found the photo taken by the smart cameras. In it, he was clearly scratching his head with his free hand. Writing in a blog post in Nippur, Hansenn took the time to explain what he thinks went wrong with the Dutch police AI and the smart camera they used, the Monocam, and how it could be improved. 

In one experiment he discussed with [Belgian news outlet] HLN, Hansenn said the AI confused a pen with a toothbrush — identifying it as a pen when it was just held in his hand and as a toothbrush when it was close to a mouth. As such, Hansenn told HLN that it seems the AI may just automatically conclude that if someone holds a hand near their head, it means they&#x27;re using a phone.
 

&quot;We are widely assured that AIs are subject to human checking,&quot; notes Slashdot reader Bruce66423 — but did a human police officer just defer to what the AI was reporting? Clearly the human-in-the-loop also made a mistake. 

Hansenn will have to wait up to six months to see if his appeal of the fine has gone through. And the article notes that the Netherlands has been using this technology for several years, with plans for even more automated monitoring in the years to come...

As was recently announced, the Linux kernel project has been accepted as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) for vulnerabilities found in Linux. 

This is a trend, of more open source projects taking over the haphazard assignments of CVEs against their project by becoming a CNA so that no other group can assign CVEs without their involvment. Here&#x27;s the curl project doing much the same thing for the same reasons. I&#x27;d like to point out the great work that the Python project has done in supporting this effort, and the OpenSSF project also encouraging it and providing documentation and help for open source projects to accomplish this. I&#x27;d also like to thank the cve.org group and board as they all made the application process very smooth for us and provided …</span>

For many publishers and platforms, having their data crawled for training data felt less like trading and more like stealing. &quot;What we found pretty quickly with the AI companies,&quot; says Medium CEO Tony Stubblebin, &quot;is not only was it not an exchange of value, we&#x27;re getting nothing in return. Literally zero.&quot; When Stubblebine announced last fall that Medium would be blocking AI crawlers, he wrote that &quot;AI companies have leached value from writers in order to spam Internet readers.&quot; 

Over the last year, a large chunk of the media industry has echoed Stubblebine&#x27;s sentiment. &quot;We…</span>

                              <span>This week the non-profit Rust Foundation announced the release of a report on what their Security Initiative accomplished in the last six months of 2023. &quot;There is already so much to show for this initiative,&quot; says the foundation&#x27;s executive director, &quot;from several new open source security projects to several completed and publicly available security threat models.&quot; 

From the executive summary:
 When the user base of any programming language grows, it becomes more attractive to malicious actors. As any programming language ecosystem expands with more libraries, packages, and frameworks, the surface area for attacks increases. Rust is no different. As the steward of the Rust programming language, the Rust Foundation has a responsibility to provide a range of resources to the growing Rust c…</span>

                              <span>Tech workers are accused of driving up rents in America&#x27;s major cities — but in fact, the problem may be everywhere. Half of America&#x27;s renters &quot;are paying more than a third of their salary in housing costs,&quot; reports NPR&#x27;s Weekend Edition, &quot;and for those looking to buy, scant few homes on the market are affordable for a typical household. 

&quot;To ramp up supply, cities are taking a fresh look at their zoning rules and the regulations that spell out what can be built where and what can&#x27;t.&quot;

 And many are finding that their old rules are too rigid, making it too hard and too expensive to build many new homes. So these cities, as well as some states, are undertaking a process called zoning reform. They&#x27;re crafting new rules that do things like allow multifamily homes in more neighborhoods, encou…</span>

&quot;We decided to build it after seeing the emphasis that AI companies are putting on &quot;responsibility,&quot; and seeing how difficult that is to balance with usefulness,&quot; said Mike Lacher, one half of Brain (the other being Brian Moore) in an email to TechCrunch. &quot;With GOODY-2, we saw a novel solution: what if we didn&#x27;t even worry about usefulness and put responsibility above all else.

Experiments carried out on the International Space Station showed magnolia wood was unusually stable and resistant to cracking — and &quot;when it burns up as it re-enters the atmosphere after completing its mission, will produce only a fine spray of Âbiodegradable ash.&quot;

The LignoSat probe has been built by researchers at Kyoto University and the logging company Sumitomo Forestry in order to test the idea of using biodegradable materials such as wood to see if they can act as environmentally friendly alternatives to the metals from which all satellites are currently constructed. &quot;All the satellites which re-enter the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere burn and create tiny alumina particles…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this report from Reuters:
Reddit has signed a contract allowing an AI company to train its models on the social media platform&#x27;s content, Bloomberg News reported, citing people familiar with the matter... The agreement, signed with an &quot;unnamed large AI company&quot;, could be a model for future contracts of a similar nature, Bloomberg reported. 

 Mashable writes that the move &quot;means that Reddit posts, from the most popular subreddits to the comments of lurkers and small accounts, could build up already-existing LLMs or provide a framework for the next generative AI play.&quot;
It&#x27;s a dicey decision from Reddit, as users are already at odds with the business decisions of the nearly 20-year-old platform. Last year, following Reddit&#x27;s announcement that it would begin charging for access to its APIs, thousands of Reddit forums shut down in protest... This new AI deal could generate even more user ire, as debate rages on about the ethics of using public data, art, and other human-created content to train AI. 


Some context from the Verge:
The deal, &quot;worth about $60 million on an annualized basis,&quot; Bloomberg writes, could still change as the company&#x27;s plans to go public are still in the works. 

Until recently, most AI companies trained their data on the open web without seeking permission. But that&#x27;s proven to be legally questionable, leading companies to try to get data on firmer footing. It&#x27;s not known what company Reddit made the deal with, but it&#x27;s quite a bit more than the $5 million annual deal OpenAI has reportedly been offering news publishers for their data. Apple has also been seeking multi-year deals with major news companies that could be worth &quot;at least $50 million,&quot; according to The New York Times. 
The news also follows an October story that Reddit had threatened to cut off Google and Bing&#x27;s search crawlers if it couldn&#x27;t make a training data deal with AI companies.

                              <span>The Tiobe index tries to gauge the popularity of programming languages based on search results for courses, programmers, and third-party vendors, according to InfoWorld. 

And by that criteria, &quot;Google&#x27;s Go language, or golang, has reached its highest position ever...&quot;


The language, now in the eighth ranked position for language popularity, has been on the rise for several years.... In 2015, Go hit position #122 in the TIOBE index and all seemed lost,&quot; said Paul Jansen, CEO of Tiobe. &quot;One year later, Go adopted a very strict &#x27;half-a-year&#x27; release cycle — backed up by Google. Every new release, Go improved... Nowadays, Go is used in many software fields such as back-end programming, web services and APIs,&quot; added Jansen... 
Elsewhere in the February release of Tiobe&#x27;s index, Google&#x27;s Carbon language, positioned as a successor to C++, reached the top 100 for the first time. 

Python is #1 on both TIOBE&#x27;s index and the alternative Pypl Popularity of Programming Language index, which InfoWorld says &quot;assesses language popularity based on how often language tutorials are searched on in Google.&quot; But the two lists differ on whether Java and JavaScript are more popular than C-derived languages — and which languages should then come after them. (Go ranks #12 on the Pypl index...) 

TIOBE&#x27;s calculation of the 10 most-popular programming languages:

Python
C
C++
Java
C#
JavaScript
SQL
Go
Visual Basic

                              <span>&quot;It appears that Apple Pay is down — particularly for Chase customers,&quot; reports the Verge:

 Verge staffers have had their cards declined while trying to pay with Chase cards using Apple Pay, while using the same physical card works just fine. Several people on Threads confirmed the same issue when I asked — although people with non-Chase banks like Citi appear to be using Apple Pay just fine... 

For what it&#x27;s worth, the Chase customer service line is currently up to 15-minute wait times, and agents are telling people that Apple Pay is &quot;going through maintenance&quot; to receive &quot;an unexpected upgrade,&quot; which is a delightful euphemism. Sadly, no one seems to know when things will be fixed. 

&quot;Maintenance in progress,&quot; says Apple&#x27;s system status page — saying their maintenance started five hours ago and is &quot;ongoing.&quot; (It adds that some users may be &quot;affected,&quot; and that some Maryland Users &quot;may have issues.&quot;) 
But the Verge writes that &quot;we&#x27;ve had reports in both New York and Los Angeles,&quot; while commenters on their article add that they&#x27;ve also experienced the same problem in Florida and in Colorado. 

UPDATE (2/18/2024): An Apple spokesperson told the Verge Sunday this &quot;was not an Apple Pay issue, and we saw no problems with our systems.&quot; (The Verge adds that &quot;the not-so-subtle subtext there being that this was a Chase problem...&quot;) The spokesperson added that Apple&#x27;s maintenance announcement on their system status page was unrelated.

                              <span>Slashdot reader ffkom shared this report from Tom&#x27;s Hardware:


When AMD formally introduced its Ryzen 8000G-series accelerated processing units for desktops in early January, the company mentioned that they supported ECC memory capability. Since then, the company has quietly removed mention of the technology from its website, as noted by Reddit users. 

We asked AMD to clarify the situation and were told that the company has indeed removed mentions of ECC technology from the specifications of its Ryzen 3 8300G, Ryzen 5 8500G, Ryzen 5 8600G, and Ryzen 5 8700G. The technology also cannot be enabled on motherboards, so it looks like these processors indeed do not support ECC technology at all. 

While it would be nice to have ECC support on AMD&#x27;s latest consumer Ryzen 8000G APUs, this is a technology typically reserved for AMD&#x27;s Ryzen Pro processors.

Theres autonomous tractors and &quot;smart spraying&quot; systems that use AI-powered cameras to identify weeds, just for starters. &quot;Among the critical components of precision agriculture: Internet- and GPS connected agricultural equipment, highly accurate remote sensors, &#x27;big data&#x27; analytics and cloud computing...&quot;


As with any technological revolution, however, there are both &quot;winners&quot; and &quot;losers&quot; in the emerging age of precision agriculture...

The project, code named Izanagi, will supply semiconductors essential for artificial intelligence (AI), the report added. The company would inject $30 billion in the project, with an additional $70 billion potentially coming from Middle Eastern institutions, according to the report.
 
The Japanese group already holds about a 90% stake in British chip designer Arm, per LSEG. SoftBank is known for its tech investments with high conviction bets on startups at an unheard of scale. But it had adopted a defensive strategy after being hit by plummeting valuations in the aftermath of the pandemic, when higher interest rates eroded investor appetite for risk. It returned to profit for the first time in five quarters earlier this month, as the Japanese tech investment firm was buoyed by an upturn in portfolio companies.

                              <span>For the first time, scientists say they&#x27;ve detected water molecules on the surface of an asteroid. Space.com reports: Scientists studied four silicate-rich asteroids using data gathered by the now-retired Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), a telescope-outfitted plane operated by NASA and the German Aerospace Center. Observations by SOFIA&#x27;s Faint Object InfraRed Camera (FORCAST) instrument showed that two of the asteroids -- named Iris and Massalia -- exhibit a specific wavelength of light that indicated the presence of water molecules at their surface, a new study reports.
 
While water molecules have previously been detected in asteroid samples returned to Earth, this is the first time that water molecules have been found on the surface of an asteroid in space. In a previous study, SOFIA found similar traces of water on the surface of the moon, in one of the largest craters in its southern hemisphere. [...]
 
Therefore, the findings at Iris and Massalia suggest that some silicate asteroids can conserve some of their water over the eons and may be more commonly found in the inner solar system than previously thought. In fact, asteroids are believed to be the primary source of Earth&#x27;s water, providing the necessary elements for life as we know it. Understanding of the distribution of water through space will help researchers better assess where to search for other forms of potential life, both in our solar system and beyond. The findings have been published in The Planetary Science Journal.

Now, a California lawmaker wants to try a sweeping plan to revive the city&#x27;s core by exempting most new real estate projects from environmental review, potentially quickening development by months or even years. State Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, introduced SB1227 on Friday as a proposal to exempt downtown projects from the California Environmental Quality Act, or CEQA, for a decade. The 1970 landmark law requires studies of a project&#x27;s expected impact on air, water, noise and other areas, but Wiener s…</span>

                              <span>A paper (PDF) from researchers at the University of Cambridge, supported by voices from numerous academic institutions including OpenAI, proposes remote kill switches and lockouts as methods to mitigate risks associated with advanced AI technologies. It also recommends tracking AI chip sales globally. The Register reports: The paper highlights numerous ways policymakers might approach AI hardware regulation. Many of the suggestions -- including those designed to improve visibility and limit the sale of AI accelerators -- are already playing out at a national level. Last year US president Joe Biden put forward an executive order aimed at identifying companies developing large dual-use AI models as well as the infrastructure vendors capable of training them.

                              <span>Lauren Feiner reports via The Verge: Reps. Mark Takano (D-CA) and Dwight Evans (D-PA) reintroduced the Justice in Forensic Algorithms Act on Thursday, which would allow defendants to access the source code of software used to analyze evidence in their criminal proceedings. It would also require the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to create testing standards for forensic algorithms, which software used by federal enforcers would need to meet.
 
The bill would act as a check on unintended outcomes that could be created by using technology to help solve crimes. Academic research has highlighted the ways human bias can be built into software and how facial recognition systems often struggle to differentiate Black faces, in particular. The use of algorithms to make consequential decisions in many different sectors, including both crime-solving and health care, has raised alarms for consumers and advocates as a result of such research.
 
Takano acknowledged that gaining or hiring the deep expertise needed to analyze the source code might not be possible for every defendant. But requiring NIST to create standards for the tools could at least give them a starting point for understanding whether a program matches the basic standards. Takano introduced previous iterations of the bill in 2019 and 2021, but they were not taken up by a committee.

                              <span>According to Bloomberg (paywalled), Apple plans to release a generative AI tool for iOS app developers as early as this year. Insider reports: The tech giant is working on a tool that will use artificial intelligence to write code as part of its plans to expand the capabilities of Xcode, the company&#x27;s main programming software. The revamped system will compete withÂMicrosoft&#x27;s GitHub Copilot, which sources say operates similarly. Apple is also working on an AI tool that will generate code to test apps, which could provide potential time savings for a process that&#x27;s known to be tedious. Currently, Apple is urging some engineers to test these new AI features to ensure they work before releasing them externally to developers. [...]
 
The tech giant, Bloomberg has learned, has plans to integrate AI features into its next software updates for its iPhone and iPad known internally as Crystal. Glow, another internal AI project, is slated to be added to MacOS. The company is also building features that will generate Apple Music playlists and slideshows, according to the outlet. An AI-powered search feature titled Spotlight, currently limited to answering questions around launching apps, is in the works as well, Bloomberg reported.

The new malware, spotted by Group-IB, is part of a malware suite developed by the Chinese threat group known as &#x27;GoldFactory,&#x27; which is responsible for other malware strains such as &#x27;GoldDigger&#x27;, &#x27;GoldDiggerPlus,&#x27; and &#x27;GoldKefu.&#x27; Group-IB says its analysts observed attacks primarily targeting the Asia-Pacific region, mainly Thailand and Vietnam. However, the techniques employed could be effective globally, and there&#x27;s a danger of them getting adopted by other malware strains. [...]

                              <span>After a 6-1 vote by the district board, San Francisco middle schools will teach Algebra I again this fall. Axios reports: Roughly a third of SFUSD middle schools this fall will begin offering the course to eighth graders at about a third of its 13 middle schools as well as six of its K-8 schools, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Students at other campuses will have access to the course via online classes or summer school while their schools take three years to make the transition. Those eighth graders will otherwise have to wait until high school to take the course.
 
District officials plan to evaluate the best way to enroll students throughout the district in a pilot at the first schools this fall. The first approach would be to enroll all eighth graders. The second would prioritize students&#x27; interest or readiness. The third would give students the option of taking Algebra I on top of current eighth-grade math curricula.
 
The 6-1 vote by the San Francisco Unified School District board Tuesday followed a decadelong battle over eighth graders&#x27; access to higher-level math courses and a larger debate over academic opportunity and equity in math performance. SFUSD previously taught eighth-grade algebra. But in 2014, the board voted to wait until high school to try to address racial gaps that had emerged as some students moved quicker to advanced math classes. Studies have shown that inequities including socioeconomic status, language differences and implicit bias often impede Black and Latino students&#x27; educational pursuits and result in lower rates of enrollment in higher-level classes. Yes, but: Stanford researchers found last year that large racial and ethnic gaps in advanced math enrollment persisted even after the policy change.

                              <span>Lindsay Clark reports via The Register: In a statement on the Azure console, Microsoft confirmed the Azure IoT Central service is being retired on March 31, 2027. &quot;Starting on April 1, 2024, you won&#x27;t be able to create new application resources; however, all existing IoT Central applications will continue to function and be managed. Subscription {{subscriptionld} is not allowed to create new applications. Please create a support ticket to request an exception,&quot; the statement to customers, seen by The Register, said. According to a Microsoft &quot;Learn&quot; post from February 8, 2024, IoT Central is an IoT application platform as a service (aPaaS) designed to reduce work and costs while building, managing, and maintaining IoT solutions.
 
Microsoft&#x27;s Azure IoT offering includes three pillars: IoT Hub, IoT Edge and IoT Central. IoT Hub is a cloud-based service that provides a &quot;secure and scalable way to connect, monitor, and manage IoT devices and sensors,&quot; according to Microsoft. Azure IoT Edge is designed to allow devices to run cloud-based workloads locally. And Azure IoT Central is a fully managed, cloud-based IoT solution for connecting and managing devices at scale. Central is a layer above Hub in the architecture, and Hub itself may well continue. One developer told The Register there was no warning about Hub on the Azure console. As for IoT Edge, it is &quot;a device-focused runtime that enables you to deploy, run, and monitor containerized Linux workloads.&quot; Microsoft has not said whether this would continue.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Verge: Epic is one step closer to opening its iOS games store in the European Union. As part of its 2023 year in review, Epic Games announced Apple has reinstated its developer account, which means it will finally be able to let users download Fortnite on iPhones again. Epic first announced plans to bring its game store and Fortnite to iOS in January, but it wasn&#x27;t clear whether Apple would grant it a developer account.
 
In 2020, Apple pulled Epic&#x27;s developer account after the company began using its own in-app payment option in the iOS version of Fortnite, sparking a lengthy legal battle over whether Apple&#x27;s behavior was anticompetitive. But even after the trial ended, and neither company emerged a clear winner, Apple still refused to reinstate Epic&#x27;s developer account. Things are changing now that the EU has implemented the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The new rules force Apple to open up its iOS ecosystem to third-party app stores in the EU. Epic Games says it plans to open its iOS storefront in the EU this year. &quot;I&#x27;ll be the first to acknowledge a good faith move by Apple amidst our cataclysmic antitrust battle, in granting Epic Games Sweden AB a developer account for operating Epic Games Store and Fortnite in Europe under the Digital Markets Act,&quot; Sweeney says in a post on X.

                              <span>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul is proposing legislation that would criminalize some deceptive and abusive uses of AI and require disclosure of AI in election campaign materials, her office told Axios. From the report: Hochul&#x27;s proposed laws include establishing the crime of &quot;unlawful dissemination or publication of a fabricated photographic, videographic, or audio record.&quot; Making unauthorized uses of a person&#x27;s voice &quot;in connection with advertising or trade&quot; a misdemeanor offense. Such offenses are punishable by up to one year jail sentence.
Expanding New York&#x27;s penal law to include unauthorized uses of artificial intelligence in coercion, criminal impersonation and identity theft. 

Amending existing intimate images and revenge porn statutes to include &quot;digital images&quot; -- ranging from realistic Photoshop-produced work to advanced AI-generated content. Codifying the right to sue over digitally manipulated false images. Requiring disclosures of AI use in all forms of political communication &quot;including video recording, motion picture, film, audio recording, electronic image, photograph, text, or any technological representation of speech or conduct&quot; within 60 days of an election.

                              <span>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has denied OpenAI&#x27;s attempt to trademark &quot;GPT,&quot; ruling that the term is &quot;merely descriptive&quot; and therefore unable to be registered. From a report: [...] The name, according to the USPTO, doesn&#x27;t meet the standards to register for a trademark and the protections a &quot;TM&quot; after the name affords. (Incidentally, they refused once back in October, and this is a &quot;FINAL&quot; in all caps denial of the application.) As the denial document puts it: &quot;Registration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes a feature, function, or characteristic of applicant&#x27;s goods and services.&quot; 

OpenAI argued that it had popularized the term GPT, which stands in this case for &quot;generative pre-trained transformer,&quot; describing the nature of the machine learning model. It&#x27;s generative because it produces new (ish) material, pre-trained in that it is a large model trained centrally on a proprietary database, and transformer is the name of a particular method of building AIs (discovered by Google researchers in 2017) that allows for much larger models to be trained. But the patent office pointed out that GPT was already in use in numerous other contexts and by other companies in related ones.

Commenting on Apple&#x27;s move, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney tweeted: I suspect Apple&#x27;s real reason for killing PWAs is the realization that competing web browsers could do a vastly better job of supporting PWAs -- unlike Safari&#x27;s intentionally crippled web functionality -- and turn PWAs into legit, untaxed competitors to native apps.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: More than 1,000 Ubiquiti routers in homes and small businesses were infected with malware used by Russian-backed agents to coordinate them into a botnet for crime and spy operations, according to the Justice Department. That malware, which worked as a botnet for the Russian hacking group Fancy Bear, was removed in January 2024 under a secret court order as part of &quot;Operation Dying Ember,&quot; according to the FBI&#x27;s director. It affected routers running Ubiquiti&#x27;s EdgeOS, but only those that had not changed their default administrative password. Access to the routers allowed the hacking group to &quot;conceal and otherwise enable a variety of crimes,&quot; the DOJ claims, including spearphishing and credential harvesting in the US and abroad. 

Unlike previous attacks by Fancy Bear -- that the DOJ ties to GRU Military Unit 26165, which is also known as APT 28, Sofacy Group, and Sednit, among other monikers -- the Ubiquiti intrusion relied on a known malware, Moobot. Once infected by &quot;Non-GRU cybercriminals,&quot; GRU agents installed &quot;bespoke scripts and files&quot; to connect and repurpose the devices, according to the DOJ. The DOJ also used the Moobot malware to copy and delete the botnet files and data, according to the DOJ, and then changed the routers&#x27; firewall rules to block remote management access. During the court-sanctioned intrusion, the DOJ &quot;enabled temporary collection of non-content routing information&quot; that would &quot;expose GRU attempts to thwart the operation.&quot; This did not &quot;impact the routers&#x27; normal functionality or collect legitimate user content information,&quot; the DOJ claims. &quot;For the second time in two months, we&#x27;ve disrupted state-sponsored hackers from launching cyber-attacks behind the cover of compromised US routers,&quot; said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco in a press release.

                              <span>Twenty tech companies working on AI said Friday they had signed a &quot;pledge&quot; to try to prevent their software from interfering in elections, including in the United States. From a report: The signatories range from tech giants such as Microsoft and Google to a small startup that allows people to make fake voices -- the kind of generative-AI product that could be abused in an election to create convincing deepfakes of a candidate. The accord is, in effect, a recognition that the companies&#x27; own products create a lot of risk in a year in which 4 billion people around the world are expected to vote in elections. 

&quot;Deceptive AI Election content can deceive the public in ways that jeopardize the integrity of electoral processes,&quot; the document reads. The accord is also a recognition that lawmakers around the world haven&#x27;t responded very quickly to the swift advancements in generative AI, leaving the tech industry to explore self-regulation. &quot;As society embraces the benefits of AI, we have a responsibility to help ensure these tools don&#x27;t become weaponized in elections,&quot; Brad Smith, vice chair and president of Microsoft, said in a statement. The 20 companies to sign the pledge are: Adobe, Amazon, Anthropic, Arm, ElevenLabs, Google, IBM, Inflection AI, LinkedIn, McAfee, Meta, Microsoft, Nota, OpenAI, Snap, Stability AI, TikTok, TrendMicro, Truepic and X.

                              <span>Amazon has joined rocket maker SpaceX and grocery chain Trader Joe&#x27;s in claiming that a U.S. labor agency&#x27;s in-house enforcement proceedings violate the U.S. Constitution, as the retail giant faces scores of cases claiming it interfered with workers&#x27; rights to organize. From a report: Amazon in a filing made with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) on Thursday said it plans to argue that the agency&#x27;s unique structure violates the company&#x27;s right to a jury trial. The company also said that limits on the removal of administrative judges and the board&#x27;s five members, who are appointed by the president, are unconstitutional. The filing came in a pending case accusing Amazon of illegally retaliating against workers at a warehouse in the New York City borough of Staten Island, where employees voted to unionize in 2022.

                              <span>schwit1 writes: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. won a preliminary injunction against the White House and other federal defendants in his suit alleging government censorship of his statements against vaccines on social media. The injunction, however, will be stayed until the US Supreme Court rules in a related case brought by Missouri and Louisiana. An injunction is warranted because Kennedy showed he is likely to succeed on the merits of his claims, Judge Terry A. Doughty of the US District Court for the Western District of Louisiana said Wednesday. 

The White House defendants, the Surgeon General defendants, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defendants, the Federal Bureau of Investigation defendants, and the Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency defendants likely violated the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment, Doughty said. Kennedy&#x27;s class action complaint, brought with health care professional Connie Sampognaro and Kennedy&#x27;s nonprofit, Children&#x27;s Health Defense, alleges that the federal government, beginning in early 2020, began a campaign to induce Facebook, Google (YouTube), and X, formerly known as Twitter, to censor constitutionally protected speech. 

Specifically, Kennedy said, the government suppressed &quot;facts and opinions about the COVID vaccines that might lead people to become &#x27;hesitant&#x27; about COVID vaccine mandates.&quot; Kennedy has sufficiently shown that these defendants &quot;jointly participated in the actions of the social media&quot; platforms by &#x27;&quot;insinuating&#x27; themselves into the social-media companies&#x27; private affairs and blurring the line between public and private action,&quot; Doughty said.

                              <span>The European Union is expanding its strict digital rulebook on Saturday to almost all online platforms in the bloc, in the next phase of its crackdown on toxic social media content and dodgy ecommerce products that began last year by targeting the most popular services. From a report: The EU&#x27;s trailblazing Digital Services Act has already kicked in for nearly two dozen of the biggest online platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Amazon and Wikipedia. The DSA imposes a set of strict requirements designed to keep internet users safe online, including making it easier to report counterfeit or unsafe goods or flag harmful or illegal content like hate speech as well as a ban on ads targeted at children. 

Now the rules will apply to nearly all online platforms, marketplaces and &quot;intermediaries&quot; with users in the 27-nation bloc. Only the smallest businesses, with fewer than 50 employees and annual revenue of less than 10 million euros ($11 million), are exempt. That means thousands more websites could potentially be covered by the regulations. It includes popular ones such as eBay and OnlyFans that escaped being classed as the biggest online platforms requiring extra scrutiny.

                              <span>Every OpenAI release elicits awe and anxiety as capabilities advance, evident in Sora&#x27;s strikingly realistic AI-generated video clips that went viral while unsettling industries reliant on original footage. But the company is again being secretive in all the wrong places about AI that can be used to spread misinformation. From a report: As usual, OpenAI won&#x27;t talk about the all-important ingredients that went into this new tool, even as it releases it to an array of people to test before going public. Its approach should be the other way around. OpenAI needs to be more public about the data used to train Sora, and more secretive about the tool itself, given the capabilities it has to disrupt industries and potentially elections. OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman said that red-teaming of Sora would start on Thursday, the day the tool was announced and shared with beta testers. Red-teaming is when specialists test an AI model&#x27;s security by pretending to be bad actors who want to hack or misuse it. The goal is to make sure the same can&#x27;t happen in the real world. When I asked OpenAI how long it would take to run these tests on Sora, a spokeswoman said there was no set length. &quot;We will take our time to assess critical areas for harms or risks,&quot; she added. 

The company spent about six months testing GPT-4, its most recent language model, before releasing it last year. If it takes the same amount of time to check Sora, that means it could become available to the public in August, a good three months before the US election. OpenAI should seriously consider waiting to release it until after voters go to the polls. [...] OpenAI is meanwhile being frustratingly secretive about the source of the information it used to create Sora. When I asked the company about what datasets were used to train the model, a spokeswoman said the training data came &quot;from content we&#x27;ve licensed, and publicly available content.&quot; She didn&#x27;t elaborate further.

                              <span>Apple has now offered an explanation for why iOS 17.4 removes support for Home Screen web apps in the European Union. Spoiler: it&#x27;s because of the Digital Markets Act that went into effect last August. 9to5Mac reports: Last week, iPhone users in the European Union noticed that they were no longer able to install and run web apps on their iPhone&#x27;s Home Screen in iOS 17.4. Apple has added a number of features over the years to improve support for progressive web apps on iPhone. For example, iOS 16.4 allowed PWAs to deliver push notifications with icon badges. One change in iOS 17.4 is that the iPhone now supports alternative browser engines in the EU. This allows companies to build browsers that don&#x27;t use Apple&#x27;s WebKit engine for the first time. Apple says that this change, required by the …</span>

The Chrome operating system will ultimately allow users to keep using their Windows 10 systems, while also providing regular security updates and features like data encryption. From the report: ChromeOS is significantly less popular than other operating systems. In January 2024, it held a 1.8% share of the worldwide desktop OS market, far behind Windows&#x27; share of about 73%, according to data from research firm Statcounter. ChromeOS has struggled with wider adaptability due to its incompatibility with legacy Windows applications and productivity suites used by businesses. Google said that ChromeOS would allow users to stream legacy Windows and productivity applications, which will help deliver them to devices by running the apps on a data center.

                              <span>Tom Warren reports via The Verge: Microsoft is teasing the potential for unique Xbox hardware in the future and a powerful next-gen console. Four previously exclusive Xbox games are officially coming to the PS5 and Nintendo Switch soon, and Microsoft wants to reassure Xbox fans that it&#x27;s still very much invested in the future of its platform and hardware. In an official Xbox podcast today, Xbox president Sarah Bond teased that Microsoft will deliver &#x27;the largest technical leap&#x27; with the next-generation Xbox: &quot;We&#x27;ve got more to come. There&#x27;s some exciting stuff coming out in hardware that we&#x27;re going to share this holiday. We&#x27;re also invested in the next-generation roadmap. What we&#x27;re really focused on there is delivering the largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation, which makes it better for players and better for creators and the visions that they&#x27;re building.&quot;
 
Speaking to The Verge, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer went a step further, teasing that the Xbox hardware teams are thinking about building different kinds of hardware. &quot;I&#x27;m very proud of the work that the hardware team is doing, not only for this year, but also into the future,&quot; says Spencer. &quot;[We&#x27;re] really thinking about creating hardware that sells to gamers because of the unique aspects of the hardware. It&#x27;s kind of an unleashing of the creative capability of our hardware team that I&#x27;m really excited about.&quot;
 
Perhaps that unique hardware is an Xbox handheld. &quot;We see a lot of opportunity in different types of devices, and will share specifics on our future hardware plans as soon as we are ready,&quot; says Microsoft in an Xbox blog post today.

Now, just in time for the Oscars, a new OpenAI app called Sora hopes to master cinema without going to film school. For now a research product, Sora is going out to a few select creators and a number of security experts who will red-team it for safety vulnerabilities. OpenAI plans to make it available to all wannabe auteurs at some unspecified date, but it decided to preview it in advance. Other companies, from giants like Google to startups likeRunway, have already revealed text-to-video AI projects.

                              <span>Texas-based Intuitive Machines&#x27; inaugural moon mission began early Thursday morning, heading toward what could be the first U.S. lunar landing in more than 50 years. From a report: Intuitive Machines&#x27; Nova-C lander launched from Florida on SpaceX&#x27;s Falcon 9 rocket, beginning the IM-1 mission. &quot;It is a profoundly humbling moment for all of us at Intuitive Machines. The opportunity to return the United States to the moon for the first time since 1972 is a feat of engineering that demands a hunger to explore,&quot; Intuitive Machines vice president of space systems Trent Martin said during a press conference. 

The IM-1 lander, named &quot;Odysseus&quot; after the mythological Greek hero, is carrying 12 government and commercial payloads -- six of which are for NASA under an $118 million contract. NASA leadership emphasized before the launch that &quot;IM-1 is an Intuitive Machines&#x27; mission, it&#x27;s not a NASA mission.&quot; But it marks the second mission under NASA&#x27;s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative, which aims to deliver science projects and cargo to the moon with increasing regularity in support of the agency&#x27;s Artemis crew program. The agency views CLPS missions as &quot;a learning experience,&quot; NASA&#x27;s deputy associate administrator for exploration in the science mission directorate, Joel Kearns, told press before the launch.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: For some Apple Vision Pro buyers, the honeymoon is already over. It&#x27;s no coincidence that there&#x27;s been an uptick on social media of Vision Pro owners saying they&#x27;re returning their $3,500 headsets in the past few days. Apple allows you to return any product within 14 days of purchase -- and for the first wave of Vision Pro buyers, we&#x27;re right about at that point. 

Comfort is among the most cited reasons for returns. People have said the headset gives them headaches and triggers motion sickness. The weight of the device, and the fact that most of it is front-loaded, has been another complaint. Parker Ortolani, The Verge&#x27;s product manager, told me that he thought using the device led to a burst blood vessel in his eye. At least one other person noted they had a similar experience with redness. (To be fair, VR headset users have anecdotally reported dry eyes and redness for years.)

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Applying to some of the most common customer and food service jobs in the country now requires a long and bizarre personality quiz featuring blue humanoid aliens, which tells employers how potential hires rank in terms of &quot;agreeableness&quot; and &quot;emotional stability.&quot; If you&#x27;ve applied to a job at FedEx, McDonald&#x27;s, or Darden Restaurants (the company that operates multiple chains including Olive Garden) you might have already encountered this quiz, as all these companies and others are clients of Paradox.ai, the company which runs the test and helps them with other recruiting tasks. 

Judging by the reaction on Reddit, where Paradox.ai&#x27;s personality quiz has gone viral a couple of times in recent weeks and bewildered many users, most people are not familiar with the process. Personality quizzes as part of an application for hourly work isn&#x27;t new, but the Paradox.ai test has gone repeatedly viral in recent weeks presumably because of the bizarre scenarios it presents applicants with and the blue humanoid alien thing. Other clients included on Paradox&#x27;s website include CVS, GM, Nestle, 3M, and Unilever.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: Alphabet&#x27;s Google is rolling out a new version of its powerful artificial intelligence model that it says can handle larger amounts of text and video than products made by competitors. The updated AI model, called Gemini 1.5 Pro, will be available on Thursday to cloud customers and developers so they can test its new features and eventually create new commercial applications. Google and its rivals have spent billions to ramp up their capabilities in generative AI and are keen to attract corporate clients to show their investments are paying off. [...] 

Gemini 1.5 can be trained faster and more efficiently, and has the ability to process a huge amount of information each time it&#x27;s prompted, according to Vinyals. For example, developers can use Gemini 1.5 Pro to query up to an hour&#x27;s worth of video, 11 hours of audio or more than 700,000 words in a document, an amount of data that Google says is the &quot;longest context window&quot; of any large-scale AI model yet. Gemini 1.5 can process far more data compared with what the latest AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic can handle, according to Google. In a pre-recorded video demonstration for reporters, Google showed off how engineers asked Gemini 1.5 Pro to ingest a 402-page PDF transcript of the Apollo 11 moon landing, and then prompted it to find quotes that showed &quot;three funny moments.&quot;

From the report: The search service would be partly powered by Bing, this person said. The move to launch a search app comes a year after Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said his company would &quot;make Google dance&quot; by incorporating artificial intelligence from OpenAI into Microsoft&#x27;s Bing search engine. That partnership has failed to dent Google&#x27;s search dominance. It isn&#x27;t clear whether the search product would be separate from ChatGPT, the chatbot OpenAI runs and which also uses Bing&#x27;s index of the web to answer some questions. OpenAI could be looking to speed up the service, which can be slow because it also does tasks like proofreading and summarizing documents.

                              <span>Dumping chemicals in the ocean? Spraying saltwater into clouds? Injecting reflective particles into the sky? Scientists are resorting to once unthinkable techniques to cool the planet because global efforts to check greenhouse gas emissions are failing. From a report: These geoengineering approaches were once considered taboo by scientists and regulators who feared that tinkering with the environment could have unintended consequences, but now researchers are receiving taxpayer funds and private investments to get out of the lab and test these methods outdoors. The shift reflects growing concern that efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions aren&#x27;t moving fast enough to prevent the destructive effects of heat waves, storms and floods made worse by climate change. Geoengineering isn&#x27;t a substitute for reducing emissions, according to scientists and business leaders involved in the projects. Rather, it is a way to slow climate warming in the next few years while buying time to switch to a carbon-free economy in the longer term. 

Three field experiments are under way in the U.S. and overseas. This month, researchers aboard a ship off the northeastern coast of Australia near the Whitsunday Islands are spraying a briny mixture through high-pressure nozzles into the air in an attempt to brighten low-altitude clouds that form over the ocean. Scientists hope bigger, brighter clouds will reflect sunlight away from the Earth, shade the ocean surface and cool the waters around the Great Barrier Reef, where warming ocean temperatures have contributed to massive coral die-offs. The research project, known as marine cloud brightening, is led by Southern Cross University as part of the $64.55 million, or 100 million Australian dollars, Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program. The program is funded by the partnership between the Australian government&#x27;s Reef Trust and the Great Barrier Reef Foundation and includes conservation organizations and several academic institutions.

                              <span>The UK has entered a recession after GDP contracted 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Office for National Statistics said Thursday. This follows a 0.1% GDP decline in Q3. The data shows meager 0.1% growth for the full year, the worst performance since 2009 barring 2020. All main sectors declined in Q4, with manufacturing, construction and wholesale facing the biggest drops, only partially offset by upticks in rentals and hotels. The recession deals a blow to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak&#x27;s economic pledges ahead of local elections Thursday and the national vote expected this year, potentially widening the lead held by the opposition Labour Party in polls.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from SFGate: Cisco, the San Jose-based networking and telecommunications giant, is laying off 5% of its workforce. The company announced the cuts in a Wednesday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, alongside its quarterly earnings report. Based on the company&#x27;s reported head count, the layoffs will hit at least 4,000 workers. Cisco wrote in the filing that the cuts are aimed to &quot;realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas.&quot; Most of the cuts will go through this quarter, per the filing. Cisco estimated that severance payments and other termination benefits will cost the company $800 million.
In a statement to SFGATE on Wednesday, Cisco spokesperson Robyn Blum cited &quot;the cautious macro environment, our customers continuing to absorb high levels of product inventory, and ongoing weakness in the Service Provider market,&quot; as reasons for the layoff. 
&quot;The care of our people is a top priority, and we will provide impacted employees with career support and market-competitive severance packages,&quot; the statement continued.

                              <span>After missing its sales target in the last quarter, Sony says it plans to emphasize the PlayStation 5&#x27;s profitability over unit sales as the console approaches its fourth birthday. &quot;Looking ahead, PS5 will enter the latter stage of its life cycle,&quot; said Sony senior vice president Naomi Matsuoka. &quot;As such, we will put more emphasis on the balance between profitability and sales. For this reason, we expect the annual sales pace of PS5 hardware will start falling from the next fiscal year.&quot; Sony also said it has no plans to release &quot;any new major existing franchise titles&quot; in its next fiscal year. The Verge reports: Sony now expects to sell 4 million fewer PS5 consoles in its 2023 fiscal year ending March 31st compared to previous projections, Bloomberg reports. The revision came as part of today&#x27;s third-quarter earnings release which saw Sony lower the PS5 sales forecast from the 25 million consoles it expected to sell down to 21 million.
 
While PS5 sales were up in Sony&#x27;s third quarter, increasing to 8.2 million units from 6.3 million in the same quarter the previous year, Bloomberg notes that this was roughly a million units lower than it had previously projected. That&#x27;s despite the release of the big first-party title Spider-Man 2, strong sales of third-party titles, and the launch of a new slimmer PS5 in November.
 
In its third quarter, Sony&#x27;s gaming revenue was up 16 percent versus the same period the previous year, sitting at 1.4 trillion yen (around $9.3 billion), but operating income was down 26 percent to 86.1 billion yen (around $572 million) due to promotions in the third quarter ending on December 31st.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: The U.S. Department of Defense is notifying tens of thousands of individuals that their personal information was exposed in an email data spill last year. According to the breach notification letter sent out to affected individuals on February 1, the Defense Intelligence Agency -- the DOD&#x27;s military intelligence agency -- said, &quot;numerous email messages were inadvertently exposed to the Internet by a service provider,&quot; between February 3 and February 20, 2023. TechCrunch has learned that the breach disclosure letters relate to an unsecured U.S. government cloud email server that was spilling sensitive emails to the open internet. The cloud email server, hosted on Microsoft&#x27;s cloud for government customers, was accessible from the internet without a password, likely due to a misconfiguration.
 
The DOD is sending breach notification letters to around 20,600 individuals whose information was affected. &quot;As a matter of practice and operations security, we do not comment on the status of our networks and systems. The affected server was identified and removed from public access on February 20, 2023, and the vendor has resolved the issues that resulted in the exposure. DOD continues to engage with the service provider on improving cyber event prevention and detection. Notification to affected individuals is ongoing,&quot; said DOD spokesperson Cdr. Tim Gorman in an email to TechCrunch.

                              <span>Amazon faces a class-action lawsuit accusing the company of false advertising and deceptive practices because Prime Video now serves commercials by default. Variety reports: &quot;For years, people purchased and renewed their Amazon Prime subscriptions believing that they would include ad-free streaming,&quot; the lawsuit says. &quot;But last month, Amazon changed the deal. To stream movies and TV shows without ads, Amazon customers must now pay an additional $2.99 per month ... This is not fair, because these subscribers already paid for the ad-free version; these subscribers should not have to pay an additional $2.99/month for something that they already paid for.&quot;
 
The case was filed on behalf of Wilbert Napoleon, a resident of Eastvale, Calif., who says he&#x27;s a Prime member. &quot;Plaintiff brings this case for himself and for other Amazon Prime customers,&quot; the suit said. The complain alleged that Amazon violates Washington State and California state consumer protection laws that prohibit unfair competition and deceptive business acts and practices. Amazon&#x27;s conduct, as alleged, &quot;was immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous and substantially injurious to consumers,â according to the lawsuit. The suit seeks unspecific monetary damages, including punitive damages, as well as an injunction to block Amazon&#x27;s alleged deceptive conduct.
 
The suit was filed Feb. 9, after Amazon starting on Jan. 29 began running ads in Prime Video content in major markets including the United States unless users opt to pay extra ($2.99/month in the U.S.) to have an ad-free experience. Some analysts have forecast Prime Video ads generating more than $3 billion in revenue in 2024.

                              <span>The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) asserts that only humans can be recognized as inventors on patent applications, not artificial intelligence systems, although the use of AI in the invention process is permitted and must be disclosed. The Verge reports: The agency published (PDF) its latest guidance following a series of &quot;listening&quot; tours to gather public feedback. It states that while AI systems and other &quot;non-natural persons&quot; can&#x27;t be listed as inventors in patent applications, &quot;the use of an AI system by a natural person does not preclude a natural person from qualifying as an inventor.&quot; People seeking patents must disclose if they used AI in the invention process, just as the USPTO asks all applicants to list all material information necessary to make a decision.
 
However, to be able to register a patent, the person using the AI must&#x27;ve contributed significantly to the invention&#x27;s conception. A person simply asking an AI system to create something and overseeing it, the report says, does not make them an inventor. The office says that a person who simply presents the problem to an AI system or &quot;recognizes and appreciates&quot; its output as a good invention can&#x27;t claim credit for that patent.
 
&quot;However, a significant contribution could be shown by the way the person constructs the prompt in view of a specific problem to elicit a particular solution from the AI system,&quot; the USPTO says. The office also says that &quot;maintaining &#x27;intellectual domination&#x27; over an AI system does not, on its own, make a person an inventor&quot; -- so simply overseeing or owning an AI that creates things doesn&#x27;t mean you can file a patent for them.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled that weakening end-to-end encryption disproportionately risks undermining human rights. The international court&#x27;s decision could potentially disrupt the European Commission&#x27;s proposed plans to require email and messaging service providers to create backdoors that would allow law enforcement to easily decrypt users&#x27; messages. This ruling came after Russia&#x27;s intelligence agency, the Federal Security Service (FSS), began requiring Telegram to share users&#x27; encrypted messages to deter &quot;terrorism-related activities&quot; in 2017, ECHR&#x27;s ruling said. [...] In the end, the ECHR concluded that the Telegram user&#x27;s rights had been violated, partly due to privacy advocates and international reports th…</span>

                              <span>Lyft Chief Executive Officer David Risher&#x27;s response to a clerical error that unintentionally inflated the company&#x27;s earnings outlook on Tuesday and sent shares soaring: &quot;My bad.&quot; From a report: &quot;First of all, it&#x27;s on me,&quot; Risher said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Wednesday, taking the blame for a typo in a company press release Tuesday that erroneously projected a particular measure of earnings margin to expand by an eye-watering 500 basis points. (In reality, Lyft expects margins to grow by 50 basis points.) &quot;This was a bad error,&quot; he said, &quot;but it was one zero in a press release.&quot; 

The typo, which actually appeared in multiple company documents on Tuesday, helped drive a 67% surge in Lyft&#x27;s shares in after-hours trading. The mistake was a serious one, Risher said. But it shouldn&#x27;t take away from Lyft&#x27;s &quot;butt-kicking&quot; financial performance, he said. Risher said his team at Lyft was taking the error very seriously and noted it was corrected &quot;within seconds of finding it.&quot; But in fact, on a call with analysts to discuss the quarterly results, Lyft executives didn&#x27;t immediately note the error in their opening remarks. Lyft Chief Financial Officer Erin Brewer just began referring to the company&#x27;s outlook for a 50-basis-point expansion. It wasn&#x27;t until later in the call, when an analyst pointed out the discrepancy, that Brewer acknowledged her outlook was &quot;actually a correction from the press release.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: When California state legislators passed a 2014 law banning single-use plastic bags, the hope was that it would notably reduce the amount of discarded plastic. But fast-forward nearly a decade: Californians are tossing more pounds of plastic bags than before the legislation was passed. That&#x27;s according to a recent report by the consumer advocacy group CALPIRG, which took population changes into account and found the tonnage of discarded bags rose from 4.08 per 1,000 people in 2014 to 5.89 per 1,000 people in 2022. How could this happen? 

As Susanne Rust reported this week, plastic bag manufacturers replaced one kind of plastic bag for another. You&#x27;ve probably noticed them at grocery stores or had them loaded into your car during a drive-up order. These…</span>

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: India is facing a quandary in enforcing long-delayed rules to curb the dominance of PhonePe and Google Pay in the country&#x27;s ubiquitous UPI payments network, which processes over 10 billion transactions monthly. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), a special unit of the Indian central bank, wants to limit the market share of individual companies in the popular Unified Payments Interface (UPI) system to 30%, a long-delayed effort to curb the dominance of Walmart-backed PhonePe and Alphabet&#x27;s Google Pay, which together control over 83% of the growing payments market. 

However, with rival Paytm now struggling after strict regulatory action, the NPCI faces an acute challenge in bringing down the commanding share of the leading duopoly: It doesn&#x27;t know how to. The NPCI officials believe there is a technical barrier to achieving the goal and have sought industry players in recent quarters for ideas, two sources familiar with the situation said. The NPCI, which delayed enforcing the rules to 2024, declined to comment Tuesday.

                              <span>The U.S. Navy has ramped up efforts to recruit young gamers and esports fans to meet recruitment goals, allocating up to $4.3 million this year for esports marketing. This includes hosting video game tournaments and having sailors compete as the esports team &quot;Goats &amp; Glory.&quot; Critics argue targeting minors for military marketing normalizes war and raises ethical concerns, The Guardian reports. While the military cannot formally recruit those under 17, advertising and direct interaction with minors for recruitment purposes is permitted. Veterans groups oppose this, noting the military relies on gaming&#x27;s appeal to young teens, whose brains are still developing, to influence future decisions about military service, the report adds.

The latest is a private, end-to-end encrypted syncing service. There&#x27;s no account needed, no sign-in, and the company says it never sees what you&#x27;re syncing. From a report: Using QR codes and shortcodes, and a lengthy backup code you store somewhere safe, DuckDuckGo&#x27;s browser can keep your bookmarks, passwords, &quot;favorites&quot; (i.e., new tab page shortcuts), and settings for its email protection service synced between devices and browsers. DuckDuckGo points to Google&#x27;s privacy policy for using its signed-in sync service on Chrome, which uses &quot;aggregated and anonymized synchronized browsing data to improve other Google products and services.&quot; DuckDuckGo states that the encryption key for browser sync is stored only locally on your devices and that it lacks any access to your passwords or other data.

                              <span>Apple researchers have unveiled a new AI tool called &quot;Keyframer,&quot; (PDF) which harnesses the power of large language models (LLMs) to animate static images through natural language prompts. From a report: This novel application, detailed in a new research paper published on arxiv.org, represents a giant leap in the integration of artificial intelligence into the creative process -- and it may also hint at what&#x27;s to come in newer generations of Apple products such as the iPad Pro and Vision Pro. The research paper, titled &quot;Keyframer: Empowering Animation Design using Large Language Models,&quot; explores uncharted territory in the application of LLMs to the animation industry, presenting unique challenges such as how to effectively describe motion in natural language. 

Imagine this: You&#x27;re an animator with an idea that you want to explore. You&#x27;ve got static images and a story to tell, but the thought of countless hours bending over an iPad to breathe life into your creations is, well, exhausting. Enter Keyframer. With just a few sentences, those images can begin to dance across the screen, as if they&#x27;ve read your mind. Or rather, as if Apple&#x27;s large language models (LLMs) have. Keyframer is powered by a large language model (in the study, they use GPT-4) that can generate CSS animation code from a static SVG image and prompt. &quot;Large language models have the potential to impact a wide range of creative domains, but the application of LLMs to animation is under-explored and presents novel challenges such as how users might effectively describe motion in natural language,&quot; the researchers explain.

                              <span>Magyar Telekom is returning to a standard work schedule after a four-day workweek didn&#x27;t meet expectations in a pilot project. From a report: Regular operations will return at the end of February after a one-and-a-half-year trial period, during which 300 of its almost 5,000 employees worked only four days a week for the same pay, the Hungarian unit of Deutsche Telekom AG said in an emailed release late Tuesday.

                              <span>A new satellite mission to track planet-warming emissions of methane gas is finally set to launch, now aided with AI technology to help build a global map of oil and gas infrastructure and surveil it for leaks [Editor&#x27;s note: the link may be paywalled; alternative source]. From a report: The MethaneSAT satellite was announced by the Environmental Defense Fund six years ago as a way to monitor releases of methane, an invisible gas that researchers estimate is responsible for almost a third of the emissions-induced increase in global temperatures since the start of the industrial era. The satellite is now scheduled to blast into space in March aboard a rocket operated by Elon Musk&#x27;s SpaceX. On Wednesday, Google said it would provide the AI computing capabilities required to crunch vast amounts of data produced by the orbiting methane monitor. 

MethaneSAT is the latest example of how satellites are used to detect methane emissions from oil and gas facilities, which is more than 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere over a 20-year timescale. Experts say reducing methane emissions is one of the most powerful short-term actions needed to address global warming. The International Energy Agency this year found the global energy industry was responsible for 135mn tonnes of methane emissions in 2022, only slightly below record high levels of 2019. Existing satellites have detected more than 500 &quot;super-emitting&quot; events in 2022 from oil and gas operations, the IEA said, with a further 100 such events at coal mines, which can release methane during or after operations.

                              <span>Silicon Valley institution Y Combinator has released a new list of 20 types of startups it wants to join its accelerator program -- calling for applications in sectors like AI-powered robotics, space and defense technology. From a report: Y Combinator, YC for short, updates the list periodically, depending on what kinds of startups it sees gaining traction and where it thinks there&#x27;s opportunity. This update, released in a blog post Wednesday, represents the biggest overhaul to its &quot;requests for startups&quot; since 2018. In a blog post Wednesday, YC Managing Director Dalton Caldwell described the requests as &quot;ideas we&#x27;d want to see made real, in spaces that we believe will be important in the coming decades.&quot; The result is a window into the larger trends in the world of venture capital. 

The first idea on YC&#x27;s list is applying machine learning to robotics. &quot;For decades, everyone has known that robots are the future, as any science fiction novel will show,&quot; YC partners wrote in the blog post. Now, advances around artificial intelligence are making the technology more useful, particularly in industrial settings. It listed autonomous tractors and infrastructure inspection robots as examples.

                              <span>After climbing the charts of Apple&#x27;s App Store, the trendy Kimi app, with its collection of bootlegged movies, has disappeared. From a report: Pretending to be a spot-the-difference vision-testing game, the widely downloaded app ranked above Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video in Apple&#x27;s charts this week for free entertainment apps before it was removed. Without having to pay for anything or log in to any kind of account, iPhone owners could previously use Kimi to browse a wide selection of bootlegs for popular movies and TV shows. Many of the movies up for Best Picture at this year&#x27;s Oscars were on Kimi, at varying levels of quality. 

Poor Things was included in a grainy, pixelated state, but a high-quality version of Killers of the Flower Moon was on Kimi to stream, although an intrusive ad for online casinos was splashed across the top. That definitely isn&#x27;t the viewing experience Martin Scorsese imagined for audiences. Not just limited to movies, viewers were also able to access episodes of currently airing TV shows, like RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race, through the Kimi app. Who was behind this piracy app? It remains a mystery. The developer was listed as &quot;Marcus Evans&quot; in the app store before Kimi was taken down, and this was the only app listed under that name, likely a pseudonym.

                              <span>Less than a week after naming Laura Chambers as interim CEO, Firefox&#x27;s maker Mozilla said it is cutting about 60 jobs, or 5% of its workforce. The cuts are primarily in the product development organization. Bloomberg reports: &quot;We&#x27;re scaling back investment in some product areas in order to focus on areas that we feel have the greatest chance of success,&quot; Mozilla said in a statement. &quot;We intend to re-prioritize resources against products like Firefox Mobile, where there&#x27;s a significant opportunity to grow and establish a better model for the industry.&quot;
 
Mozilla last cut a significant number of jobs four years ago at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. The not-for-profit company, which competes with Alphabet Inc.&#x27;s Google Chrome, Apple Inc.&#x27;s Safari and Microsoft Corp.&#x27;s Edge, has been grappling with sliding market share of its Firefox web browser in recent years. So far in 2024, the tech sector has cut 32,000 jobs.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Nintendo&#x27;s Satellaview, a Japan-only satellite add-on for the Super Famicom, is a rich target for preservationists because it was the home to some of the most ephemeral games ever released. That includes a host of content for Nintendo&#x27;s own games, including F-Zero. That influential Super Nintendo (Super Famicom in Japan) racing title was the subject of eight weekly broadcasts sent to subscribing Japanese homes in 1996 and 1997, some with live &quot;Soundlink&quot; CD-quality music and voiceovers. When live game broadcasts were finished, the memory cartridges used to store game data would report themselves as empty, even though they technically were not. Keeping that same 1MB memory cartridge in the system when another broadcast started would overwrite that data, and there were no rebroadcasts.
 
As reported by Matthew Green at Press the Buttons (along with Did You Know Gaming&#x27;s informative video), data from some untouched memory cartridges was found and used to re-create some of the content. Some courses, part of a multi-week &quot;Grand Prix 2&quot; event, have never been found, despite a $5,000 bounty offering and extensive effort. And yet, remarkably, the 10 courses in those later broadcasts were reverse-engineered, using a VHS recording, machine learning tools, and some manual pixel-by-pixel re-creation. The results are &quot;north of 99.9% accurate,&quot; according to those who crafted it and exist now as a mod you can patch onto an existing F-Zero ROM. [...] Their work means that, 25 years later, a moment in gaming that was nearly lost to time and various corporate currents has been, if not entirely restored, brought as close as is humanly (and machine-ably) possible to what it once was.

                              <span>Speaking at the World Governments Summit in Dubai on Tuesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman warned that &quot;very subtle societal misalignments&quot; could make artificial intelligence systems wreak havoc. The Associated Press reports: 
&quot;There&#x27;s some things in there that are easy to imagine where things really go wrong. And I&#x27;m not that interested in the killer robots walking on the street direction of things going wrong,&quot; Altman said. &quot;I&#x27;m much more interested in the very subtle societal misalignments where we just have these systems out in society and through no particular ill intention, things just go horribly wrong.&quot; However, Altman stressed that the AI industry, like OpenAI, shouldn&#x27;t be in the driver&#x27;s seat when it comes to making regulations governing the industry. &quot;We&#x27;re still in the stage of a lot of discussion. So there&#x27;s you know, everybody in the world is having a conference. Everyone&#x27;s got an idea, a policy paper, and that&#x27;s OK,&quot; Altman said. &quot;I think we&#x27;re still at a time where debate is needed and healthy, but at some point in the next few years, I think we have to move towards an action plan with real buy-in around the world.&quot; [...]
 
For his part, Altman said he was heartened to see that schools, where teachers feared students would use AI to write papers, now embrace the technology as crucial for the future. But he added that AI remains in its infancy. &quot;I think the reason is the current technology that we have is like ... that very first cellphone with a black-and-white screen,&quot; Altman said. &quot;So give us some time. But I will say I think in a few more years it&#x27;ll be much better than it is now. And in a decade it should be pretty remarkable.&quot;

It&#x27;s the company&#x27;s first recall. Waymo chief safety officer Mauricio Pena described the crashes as &quot;minor&quot; in a blog post, and said neither vehicle was carrying passengers at the time. There were no injuries. He also said Waymo&#x27;s ride-hailing service -- which is live in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin -- &quot;is not and has not been interrupted by this update.&quot; The company declined to share video of the crashes with TechCrunch.
 
Waymo said it developed, tested, and validated a fix to the software that it started deploying to its fleet on December 20. All of its robotaxis rece…</span>

                              <span>OpenAI must face a claim that it violated California unfair competition law by using copyrighted books from comedian Sarah Silverman and other authors to train ChatGPT without permission. From a report: But US District Judge Araceli Martinez-Olguin on Monday also dismissed a number of Silverman and her coplaintiffs&#x27; other legal claims, including allegations of vicarious copyright infringement, violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, negligence, and unjust enrichment. The judge gave the authors the opportunity to amend their proposed class action by March 13 to fix the defects in the complaint. 

The core of the lawsuit remains alive, as OpenAI&#x27;s motion to dismiss, filed last summer, didn&#x27;t address Silverman&#x27;s claim of direct copyright infringement for copying millions of books across the internet without permission. Courts haven&#x27;t yet determined whether using copyrighted work to train AI models falls under copyright law&#x27;s fair use doctrine, shielding the companies from liability. Although Martinez-Olguin allowed the unfair competition claim to advance, she said the claim could be preempted by the federal Copyright Act, which prohibits state law claims that allege the same violation as a copyright claim.

                              <span>Estate agents are increasingly using AI tools to digitally furnish empty rental flats, a practice known as &quot;virtual staging,&quot; to make them look occupied in listings. While virtual staging has existed for years, AI advancements have made the process faster and cheaper. One major UK estate agency already offers AI staging services to customers, Vice reported this week. Industry insiders cited by Vice said AI virtual staging is likely to become more widespread as costs fall. The unrealistic furniture from AI staging can be noticeable, such as bunk beds with overlapping ladders. But the technology continues advancing in quality. The story adds: Although some agents have experimented with using popular AI image generators like Dall-e and Midjourney to &quot;fix&quot; property pictures, the results are usually pretty bizarre, like in this example, where the AI has envisioned bookcases in every corner of the living room and put a hob at perfect height for a toddler. Companies like Virtual Staging AI, ModelProp and Gepetto, which describes itself as like &quot;Pinterest on steroids,&quot; are now taking this technology and tailoring it specifically to virtual furnishing.

                              <span>According to the Wall Street Journal, Walmart is in talks to buy TV manufacturer Vizio for more than $2 billion. Shares of Vizio jumped 36% after the report, while Walmart&#x27;s shares were down about 1%. From the report: Walmart, including its Sam&#x27;s Club chain, has historically been Vizio&#x27;s largest customer. Vizio is historically the largest television brand sold at Walmart by sales. The deal talks demonstrate the importance of consumer data and ad space for major retailers as they build out their ad businesses and compete with Amazon. In addition to being an e-commerce behemoth, Amazon is among the biggest ad players in the U.S. behind Google parent Alphabet and Facebook owner Meta Platforms. Amazon has also been building its own smart TV business. Developing...

                              <span>FTC chair Lina Khan is hunting for evidence that Microsoft, Google and Amazon require cloud computing spend, board seats or exclusivity deals in return for their investments in AI startups. From a report: At a Friday event, Khan framed today&#x27;s AI landscape as an inflection point for tech that is &quot;enormously important for opening up markets and injecting competition and disrupting existing incumbents.&quot; The FTC chair offered Axios&#x27; Sara Fischer new details of how she&#x27;s handling a market inquiry into the relationship between Big Tech companies and AI startups, in an interview at the Digital Content Next Summit in Charleston, S.C. 

In handling the surge in AI innovation and its impacts on the broader tech and media landscape, Khan said she aims to tackle monopoly &quot;before it becomes fully fledged.&quot;
She said the FTC is looking for chokepoints in each layer of the AI tech stack: &quot;chips. compute, foundational models, applications.&quot; Khan said she&#x27;s also paying close attention to vertical integration -- when players look to extend dominance over one tech layer into adjacent layers -- or when they attempt acquisitions aimed at solidifying an existing monopoly. That includes any potential integration between Sam Altman&#x27;s nascent chip project and OpenAI, though she said she welcomes chip competition.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from MacRumors: Apple&#x27;s iMessage will avoid regulation requiring interoperability with other messaging platforms under the EU&#x27;s Digital Markets Act (DMA), following the conclusion of an investigation by the regulator (via Bloomberg). The probe concluded that the iMessage platform and Microsoft&#x27;s Bing do not hold a dominant enough position to be brought under the DMA&#x27;s strict rules for services provided by big tech&#x27;s so-called digital &quot;gatekeepers,&quot; which include Apple, Meta, Google, Amazon, and TikTok, according to the EU.
 
The EU has been working on legislation under the DMA that would have required Apple to make changes to iMessage to make it available on other platforms. The interoperability rules would have meant that Meta apps like WhatsApp or Messenger could request to interoperate with Apple&#x27;s iMessage framework, and Apple would have been forced to comply within the EU. However, the EU probe found that iMessage falls outside the legislation because it is not widely used by businesses. The reprieve for Apple is part of a five-month market investigation by the European Commission. It&#x27;s not all good news for Apple, though. The DMA is still forcing the company to implement updates that will allow iPhone and iPad users to download and install apps outside the App Store through alternative app marketplaces. The changes will arrive with iOS 17.4 in March.

                              <span>New York City&#x27;s public schools chancellor said the city did not pass Tuesday&#x27;s remote learning &quot;test&quot; due to technical issues. From a report: &quot;As I said, this was a test. I don&#x27;t think that we passed this test,&quot; David Banks said during a news briefing, adding that he felt &quot;disappointed, frustrated and angry&quot; as a result of the technical issues. NYC Public Schools did a lot of work to prepare for the remote learning day, Banks said, but shortly before 8 a.m. they were notified that parents and students were having difficulty signing onto remote learning. 

This is the first time NYC Public Schools has implemented remote learning on a snow day since introducing the no snow day policy in 2022. The district serves 1.1 million students in more than 1,800 schools. Banks blamed the technical issues on IBM, which helps facilitate the city&#x27;s remote learning program. &quot;IBM was not ready for primetime,&quot; Banks said, adding that the company was overwhelmed with the surge of people signing on for school. IBM has since expanded their capacity and a total of 850,000 students and teachers are currently online, Banks said. &quot;We&#x27;ll work harder to do better next time,&quot; he said, adding that there will be a deeper analysis into what went wrong.

                              <span>Jensen Huang took an indirect jab at Sam Altman when he said $7 trillion can buy &quot;apparently all the GPUs.&quot; From a report: The Nvidia CEO made the quip at the World Governments Summit in Dubai on Monday when asked how many GPU chips that much money could buy. Altman, the OpenAI chief, is reportedly trying to raise trillions to boost supplies of the chips needed for AI processing. Huang told the United Arab Emirates&#x27; AI minister, Omar Al Olama, that developing AI wouldn&#x27;t cost as much as the amount Altman is seeking to raise. The Nvidia CEO said AI infrastructure costs would be considerably less than the $5 trillion to $7 trillion Altman is reportedly trying to raise because of expected advances in computing. 

&quot;You can&#x27;t assume just that you will buy more computers. You have to also assume that the computers are going to become faster and therefore the total amount that you need is not as much,&quot; Huang said. He also suggested that the cost of building AI data centers globally would amount to $2 trillion by 2029. Huang said: &quot;There&#x27;s about a trillion dollars&#x27; worth of installed base of data centers. Over the course of the next four or five years, we&#x27;ll have $2 trillion worth of data centers that will be powering software around the world.&quot;

                              <span>When it comes to defeating patent trolls with crowd-sourced prior art, Cloudflare is now two-for-two after winning its latest case against Sable Networks. The Register: Sable Networks, which owns patents originally given to defunct &quot;flow-based router&quot; company Caspian Networks, sued Cloudflare and five other companies in 2021 alleging a whole host of violations of four patents now owned by Sable. A lot has changed since the case was filed in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas, leading to a jury verdict last week that found Cloudflare not only didn&#x27;t infringe on the single patent that made it to trial, but that the final patent claim at issue was invalid as well. It took the jury just two hours to return the result, Cloudflare said. 

&quot;Since Sable first sued us, we&#x27;ve invalidated significant parts of three Sable patents, hamstringing their ability to bring lawsuits against other companies,&quot; Cloudflare&#x27;s in-house counsel boasted on Monday. Cloudflare said that it managed to whittle the case down from four patents and &quot;approximately 100 claims&quot; to a single claim on one patent -- number 7,012,919 -- over the past three years. This is thanks in part to the assistance of outside investigators on Project Jengo, a scheme first launched in 2017 to get help digging up prior-art patents when Cloudflare sued by another patent troll, Blackbird Technologies.

                              <span>Backblaze has published a report on hard drive failures for 2023, finding that rates increased during the year due to aging drives that it plans to upgrade. From a report: Backblaze, which focuses on cloud-based storage services, claims to have more than three exabytes of data storage under its management. As of the end of last year, the company monitored 270,222 hard drives used for data storage, some of which are excluded from the statistics because they are still being evaluated. That still left a collection of 269,756 hard drives comprised of 35 drive models. Statistics on SSDs used as boot drives are reported separately. 

Backblaze found one drive model exhibited zero failures for all of 2023, the Seagate 8 TB ST8000NM000A. However, this came with the caveat that there are only 204 examples in service, and these were deployed only since Q3 2022, so have accumulated a limited number of drive days (total time operational). Nevertheless, as Backblaze&#x27;s principal cloud storage evangelist Andy Klein pointed out: &quot;Zero failures over 18 months is a nice start.&quot;

Superlist starts at $8 a month, but offers &quot;uinlimited tasks, notes, and reminders, and unlimited private lists&quot; for individuals at no cost.

                              <span>A company called Hands-Free Automation (HFA) has been accused of improperly relisting properties on Airbnb at higher prices after taking listings from hotel and short-term rental sites, according to a lawsuit filed in February. HFA founder Anthony Agyeman allegedly promised investors returns in 3-6 months for $20,000-30,000 investments in owning stakes in Airbnb listings. However, Airbnb prohibits the practice, and HFA has not been authorized by property owners, CNBC reported this week. The Federal Trade Commission has accused similar companies previously of making false promises of profits. Airbnb said it was unaware of contact from regulators regarding HFA.

                              <span>An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: On a brutal December day, 17% of Spotify employees found out they had been laid off in the company&#x27;s third round of job cuts last year. Not long after, music fans around the world realized that the cult-favorite website Every Noise at Once (EveryNoise), an encyclopedic goldmine for music discovery, had stopped working. These two events were not disconnected. Spotify data alchemist Glenn McDonald, who created EveryNoise, was one of the 1,500 employees who was let go that day, but his layoff had wider-reaching implications; now that McDonald doesn&#x27;t have access to internal Spotify data, he can no longer maintain EveryNoise, which became a pivotal resource for the most obsessive music fans to track new releases and learn more about the sounds they love.
 
&quot;The project is to understand the communities of listening that exist in the world, figure out what they&#x27;re called, what artists are in them and what their audiences are,&quot; McDonald told TechCrunch. &quot;The goal is to use math where you can to find real things that exist in listening patterns. So I think about it as trying to help global music self-organize.&quot; If you work at a big tech company and get laid off, you probably won&#x27;t expect the company&#x27;s customers to write nine pages of complaints on a community forum, telling your former employer how badly they messed up by laying you off. Nor would you expect an outpouring of Reddit threads and tweets questioning how you could possibly get the axe. But that&#x27;s how fans reacted when they heard McDonald&#x27;s fate.

                              <span>A registered sex offender has become the first person in England and Wales to be convicted of cyber-flashing. The BBC reports: Nicholas Hawkes, 39, of Basildon, Essex, sent unsolicited photos of his erect penis to a 15-year-old girl and a woman on Friday. The woman took screenshots of the image on WhatsApp and reported Hawkes to Essex Police the same day.
Hawkes admitted two charges when he appeared before magistrates in Southend earlier. He is the first person to be convicted of the new offense of cyber-flashing, which was brought in under the Online Safety Act and came into effect on January 31.
 
After pleading guilty to two counts of sending a photograph or film of genitals to cause alarm, distress, or humiliation, he was remanded in custody until March 11, when he will be sentenced at Basildon Crown Court. Hawkes is a registered sex offender until November 2033 after he was convicted and given a community order for sexual activity with a child under 16 and exposure last year at Basildon Crown Court, the CPS said. He will also be sentenced for breaching the order when he is sentenced in March.

                              <span>Danish 8th, 9th, and 10th graders vote in a mock election every year in Denmark. The results for 2024 were a startling refutation of the idea that young people must be inherently left-leaning. The dominating winner was Liberal Alliance, a center-right party that speaks to the virtues of individualism, entrepreneurship, tax cuts, and a limited welfare state. They took just about every third vote.
Some of that is being ascribed to the star power of the party’s young leader, Alex Vanopslagh. At an age of just 32, he has managed to lift his party to incredible heights amongst not just the kids, but the adults too. In large part, it&#x27;s claimed, because of his presence on TikTok (where he’s known as “Daddy Vanopslagh”) and other social media.

We wanted to share an update on what the Council has been working on since our last update.
Accomplishments so far
Project Structure
The Council has agreed to make the Release team a subteam of the Infra team in RFC #3533.
Ryan Levick has stepped off the Council as part of this transition, and we thank him for the very significant help he has provided.
Ryan has been a part of the Core team since 2021, and was part of the group that designed and created the Leadership Council, and has earned a well deserved break.
We created the Project Structure Committee to help drive the discussion about the &quot;shape&quot; of the Rust project, and to define the goals and responsibilities of that committee.

                              <span>It gives me great pleasure to announce (rather belatedly1) that Tyler Mandry has been chosen as the new lang-team co-lead. Tyler is a great choice for lead, as he always brings a balanced, thoughtful perspective to discussions, but is also willing to take strong positions when he believes he knows the right path forward. And he usually does.
You may have seen Tyler speak at RustConf last year, where he delivered one of the opening keynotes; Tyler also serves as the co-lead for the Async Rust Working Group, and in that capacity he has authored a number of influential and thoughtful blog posts, most recently making the case for what reliability means to async. I know I speak for everyone on the team when I say that we are looking forward to seeing what Tyler will help bring about for Rust!
This announcement is way overdue, as Tyler was chosen on Sep 21 of 2023! Sorry Tyler! Better late than never, as they say. ↩</span>

                              <span>Starting today, telcos in American will need to disclose system break-ins within seven days. &quot;[T]he same deadline now exists to report any data leaks to the FBI and US Secret Service as well,&quot; adds The Register. From the report: After releasing a proposed rule in early January and giving the industry 30 days to respond, the FCC&#x27;s final rule was published today. It solidifies what the agency proposed a little more than a month ago, and what was teased in early 2022 when FCC chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel drafted initial changes to the commission&#x27;s 16-year old security &quot;breach&quot; reporting duties.
 
Along with requiring that attacks are reported to the FCC within seven days of a telco discovering them, the same deadline now exists to report any data leaks to the FBI and US Secret Service as well. As the FCC planned, the new rule also eliminates the mandatory seven-day waiting period for reporting break-ins to consumers. The FCC now &quot;requires carriers to notify customers of breaches of covered data without unreasonable delay ... and in no case more than 30 days following reasonable determination of a breach.&quot;
 
&quot;Reasonable determination&quot; of a data blurt is further defined as &quot;when the carrier has information indicating that it is more likely than not that there was a breach&quot; and &quot;does not mean reaching a conclusion regarding every fact surrounding a data security incident that may constitute a breach.&quot; In other words, if customers are affected then they had better be notified post-haste. The FCC has additionally extended the scope of data exposure types that telecom customers must be notified of. Prior to the passage of the new rule customers only had to be told if Customer proprietary network information (CPNI) was exposed to the world.

The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) grant would establish a Dallas O-RAN testing center to prove the standard&#x27;s viability as a way to head off Huawei&#x27;s steady cruise toward a global cellular network hardware monopoly.
 
Verizon global network and technology president Joe Russo promoted the funding as a way to achieve &quot;faster innovation in an open environment.&quot; To achieve the standard&#x27;s goals, AT&amp;T vice president of RAN technology R…</span>

                              <span>FT Alphaville: Last year, Norway&#x27;s $1.5tn sovereign wealth fund revealed that it had lost NKr980mn, roughly $92mn, on an error relating to how it calculated its mandated benchmark. Here&#x27;s what Norges Bank Investment Management said at the time: &quot;In February this year, a calculation error was discovered in the composition of the index we&#x27;re measured against. This error led to a marginal overweight in US fixed income relative to global fixed income. When this was discovered, we immediately set about correcting it, but because the fund is so large, the return was 0.7 basis points. Due to this our previously reported positive relative return of NOK 118 billion was adjusted down to NOK 117 billion.&quot;

As such, scientists may be incentivized to inflate their citation counts. While previous literature has examined self-citations and citation cartels, it remains unclear whether scientists can purchase citations. Here, we compile a dataset of about 1.6 million profiles on Google Scholar to examine instances of citation fraud on the platform. We survey faculty at highly-ranked universities, and confirm that Google Scholar is widely used when evaluating scientists. Intrigued by a citationboosting service that we unravelled during our investigation, we contacted the service while undercover as a fictional author, and managed to purchase 50 citations. These findings provide conclusive evidence that citations can be bought in bulk, and highlight the need to look beyond citation counts.

                              <span>Nvidia blog: Every country needs to own the production of their own intelligence, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang told attendees Monday at the World Governments Summit in Dubai. Huang, who spoke as part of a fireside chat with the UAE&#x27;s Minister of AI, His Excellency Omar Al Olama, described sovereign AI -- which emphasizes a country&#x27;s ownership over its data and the intelligence it produces -- as an enormous opportunity for the world&#x27;s leaders. &quot;It codifies your culture, your society&#x27;s intelligence, your common sense, your history -- you own your own data,&quot; Huang told Al Olama during their conversation, a highlight of an event attended by more than 4,000 delegates from 150 countries. 

&quot;We completely subscribe to that vision,&quot; Al Olama said. &quot;That&#x27;s why the UAE is moving aggressively on creating large language models and mobilizing compute.&quot; Huang&#x27;s appearance in the UAE comes as the Gulf State is moving rapidly to transform itself from an energy powerhouse into a global information technology hub. Dubai is the latest stop for Huang in a global tour that has included meetings with leaders in Canada, France, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam over the past six months. The Middle East is poised to reap significant benefits from AI, with PwC projecting a $320 billion boost to the region&#x27;s economy by 2030.

                              <span>Nvidia briefly surpassed Amazon in market capitalization on Monday, as the euphoria around AI catapulted the chipmaker to the fourth most valuable U.S. company. From a report: At a record high of $734.96, Nvidia was worth $1.82 trillion in market value, compared to $1.81 trillion for retail giant Amazon.com and a few billions away from Google-owner Alphabet&#x27;s $1.87 trillion, according to LSEG data. The last time Nvidia was more valuable than Amazon was in 2002, when they were each worth under $6 billion.

                              <span>HP is seeking as much as $4 billion from Autonomy&#x27;s former bosses following a London judge&#x27;s finding that they fraudulently boosted the value of the company before its sale. From a report: Founder Mike Lynch was found to have inflated Autonomy&#x27;s revenue alongside his chief financial officer Sushovan Hussain and induced HP to buy the firm for $11 billion, according to a London civil judgment in 2022. The British tech tycoon is currently waiting to face a criminal trial in the US over the sale after being extradited last year. He was previously investigated by the UK&#x27;s Serious Fraud Office but the agency dropped its case. Hussain was convicted in the US for his role in the saga. Lawyers for HP calculated the total losses that Lynch and Hussain must pay back as over $4 billion, according to court documents prepared for a hearing Monday. This was revised from a previous calculation of $5 billion at trial due to further evidence.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shares a report: The startup that develops the phone app for casino resort giant WinStar has secured an exposed database that was spilling customers&#x27; private information to the open web. Oklahoma-based WinStar bills itself as the &quot;world&#x27;s biggest casino&quot; by square footage. The casino and hotel resort also offers an app, My WinStar, in which guests can access self-service options during their hotel stay, their rewards points and loyalty benefits, and casino winnings. 

The app is developed by a Nevada software startup called Dexiga. The startup left one of its logging databases on the internet without a password, allowing anyone with knowledge of its public IP address to access the WinStar customer data stored within using only their web browser. Dexiga took the database offline after TechCrunch alerted the company to the security lapse. Anurag Sen, a good-faith security researcher who has a knack for discovering inadvertently exposed sensitive data on the internet, found the database containing personal information, but it was initially unclear who the database belonged to. Sen said the personal data included full names, phone numbers, email addresses and home addresses. Sen shared details of the exposed database with TechCrunch to help identify its owner and disclose the security lapse.

                              <span>Many websites are using AI tools to generate fake obituaries about average people for profit. These articles lack substantiating details but are optimized for SEO, frequently outranking legitimate obituaries, The Verge reports. The fake obituaries, as one can imagine, are causing distress for grieving families and friends. In response, Google told The Verge that it aims to surface high-quality information but struggles with &quot;data voids.&quot; The company terminated some YouTube channels sharing fake notices but declined to say if the flagged websites violate policies.

                              <span>US companies are discussing cost control on earnings calls at a record rate, amid a push to reallocate funds and invest in new technologies, according to an analysis by Morgan Stanley strategists. From a report: Transcript mentions of &quot;operational efficiency&quot; are at the highest ever in the US during this earnings season as companies focus on expense discipline, but also invest in technologies &quot;that can drive future productivity like AI,&quot; a team led by Michael Wilson wrote in a note. 

There is a notable overlap among the industries discussing operational efficiency most prevalently and those that are discussing AI, the strategists said. These groups include software, professional services, health care services, and financial services. Pfizer, BlackRock, and Lam Research were among S&amp;P 500 companies touting operational efficiency in their earnings calls this season, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rising focus on cost control comes as firms position to protect margins amid hopes for a soft economic landing. Investors have looked for signs of cooling in the jobs market to gauge when the Federal Reserve will lower borrowing costs, although recent hot data has signaled the Fed won&#x27;t be easing anytime soon.

                              <span>At a press conference last week, a California Assemblymember joined the State Superintendent of Public Instruction in announcing a bill that, if passed, would require every public high school to teach computer science. (And establish CS as a high school graduation requirement by the 2030-31 school year.) 

Long-time Slashdot reader theodp says he noticed posters with CS-education advocacy charts and stats &quot;copied verbatim&quot; from the tech giant-backed nonprofit Code.org. (And &quot;a California Dept. of Education news release also echoed Code.org K-12 CS advocacy factoids.&quot;)


The announcement came less than two weeks after Code.org CEO Hadi Partovi — whose goal is to make CS a HS graduation requirement in all 50 states by 2030 — was a keynote speaker at the Association of California School Administrators Superintendents&#x27; Symposium. Even back in an October 20 Facebook post, [California state assemblyman] Berman noted he&#x27;d partnered with Code.org on legislation in the past and hinted that something big was in the works on the K-12 CS education front for California. &quot;I had the chance to attend Code.org&#x27;s 10th anniversary celebration and chat with their founder, Hadi Partovi, as well as CS advocate Aloe Blacc. They&#x27;ve done amazing work expanding access to computer science education... and I&#x27;ve been proud to partner with them on legislation to do that in CA. More to come!&quot;

                              <span>Early on in my career, I learned a very important lesson about creativity: It can’t be saved for later. Creativity is perishable, just like inspiration. It has to be discharged regularly or it will spoil. And if you let enough of it go to waste, eventually your talents will sour and shrivel with it.
This was counterintuitive to me. I naively thought I could run out the clock every day on a creatively dead-end job, and then pursue my all own endeavors full of zest at night, with all the creativity I had saved. But it didn’t work like that. Spending eight hours a day spinning my intellectual wheels would get me nowhere at night when I finally tried to move.
That’s how I realized that being fully engaged at work is how you plant the best seeds for your own adventures. So when weighing the pro…</span>

                              <span>Last night in San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown, &quot;A person jumped on the hood of a Waymo driverless taxi and smashed its windshield...&quot; reports the Verge, &quot;generating applause before a crowd formed around the car and covered it in spray paint, breaking its windows, and ultimately set it on fire.&quot;


The fire department arrived minutes later, according to a report in The Autopian, but by then flames had already fully engulfed the car.... Waymo representative Sandy Karp told The Verge via email that the fully autonomous car &quot;was not transporting any riders&quot; when it was attacked and fireworks were tossed inside the car, sparking the flames... 


The fire takes place against the backdrop of simmering tension between San Francisco residents and automated vehicle operators... Just last week, a Waymo car struck a cyclist who had reportedly been following behind a truck turning across its path. 

The &quot;burnt-out husk of the electric Waymo Jaguar&quot; appears in a video posted on YouTube, according to the article. &quot;Another set of videos posted by software developer Michael Vendi gives a view into the scene as it played out and the fire grew.&quot; 

San Francisco&#x27;s 49ers play in the Super Bowl this afteroon, so last night&#x27;s celebrations for Chinese New Year could be followed by additional celebrations tonight. Police Chief Bill Scott is already urging residents to behave responsibly. &quot;Please don&#x27;t light anything on fire.&quot;

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this report from the Associated Press:


An abrupt shutdown of Atlantic Ocean currents that could put large parts of Europe in a deep freeze is looking a bit more likely and closer than before as a new complex computer simulation finds a &quot;cliff-like&quot; tipping point looming in the future. A long-worried nightmare scenario, triggered by Greenland&#x27;s ice sheet melting from global warming, still is at least decades away if not longer, but maybe not the centuries that it once seemed, a new study in Friday&#x27;s Science Advances finds. 

The study, the first to use complex simulations and include multiple factors, uses a key measurement to track the strength of vital overall ocean circulation, which is slowing. A collapse of the current — called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation or AMOC — would change weather worldwide because it means a shutdown of one of key the climate and ocean forces of the planet. It would plunge northwestern European temperatures by 9 to 27 degrees (5 to 15 degrees Celsius) over the decades, extend Arctic ice much farther south, turn up the heat even more in the Southern Hemisphere, change global rainfall patterns and disrupt the Amazon, the study said. Other scientists said it would be a catastrophe that could cause worldwide food and water shortages. 


&quot;We are moving closer (to the collapse), but we we&#x27;re not sure how much closer,&quot; said study lead author Rene van Westen, a climate scientist and oceanographer at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. &quot;We are heading towards a tipping point.&quot; When this global weather calamity — grossly fictionalized in the movie &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; — may happen is &quot;the million-dollar question, which we unfortunately can&#x27;t answer at the moment,&quot; van Westen said. He said it&#x27;s likely a century away but still could happen in his lifetime. He just turned 30. 

&quot;It also depends on the rate of climate change we are inducing as humanity,&quot; van Westen said.

                              <span>&quot;Mutant wolves roaming the deserted streets of Chernobyl appear to have developed resistance to cancer,&quot; reports Sky News, &quot;raising hopes the findings can help scientists fight the disease in humans.&quot;

Dr Cara Love, an evolutionary biologist and ecotoxicologist at Princeton University in the U.S., has been studying how the Chernobyl wolves survive despite generations of exposure to radioactive particles... The researchers discovered that Chernobyl wolves are exposed to upwards of 11.28 millirem of radiation every day for their entire lives — which is more than six times the legal safety limit for a human. Dr Love found the wolves have altered immune systems similar to cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment, but more significantly she also identified specific parts of the animals&#x27; genetic information that seemed resilient to increased cancer risk.

If you were not familiar, Servo is an experimental browser engine that leverages the power of Rust to provide a memory-safe and modular experience that is highly adaptable. After Mozilla created Servo back in 2012 as a research project, it saw its share of ups and downs over the years, with it making a comeback in 2023; thanks to a fresh approach by the developers on how Servo should move forward.

In the case of the Berkeley, California-based startup, its nascent technology will be critical to cleaning up one of the hardest-to-decarbonize sectors: aviation. Twelve uses a technique called electrolysis that uses electricity to repurpose carbon dioxide and water into various products. When the electricity is generated from renewables, the process is essentially no-carbon. The company&#x27;s CO2 electrochemical reactor — called OPUS — will be at the center of its first commercial production p…</span>

Nine years after winning the Turing award, the 78-year-old cryptologist shared his perspective on some other issues:


 What do you think about the state of digital spying today? 

Hellman: There&#x27;s a need for greater international cooperation. How can we have true cyber security when nations are planning — and implementing — cyber attacks on one another? How can we ensure that AI is used only for good when nations are building it into their weapons systems? Then, there&#x27;s the grandaddy of all technological threats, nuclear weapons.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this report from the New York Times

When it&#x27;s after hours, and the boss is on the line, Australian workers — already among the world&#x27;s best-rested and most personally fulfilled employees — can soon press &quot;decline&quot; in favor of the seductive call of the beach. In yet another buttress against the scourge of overwork, Australia&#x27;s Senate on Thursday passed a bill giving workers the right to ignore calls and messages outside of working hours without fear of repercussion. It will now return to the House of Representatives for final approval. 

The bill, expected to pass in the House with ease, will let Australian workers refuse &quot;unreasonable&quot; professional communication outside of the workday. Workplaces that punish employees for not responding to such demands could be fined. &quot;Someone who is not being paid 24 hours a day shouldn&#x27;t be penalized if they&#x27;re not online and available 24 hours a day,&quot; Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said at a news conference Wednesday... 

Australia follows in the footsteps of European nations such as France, which in 2017 introduced the right of workers to disconnect from employers while off duty, a move later emulated by Germany, Italy and Belgium. The European Parliament has also called for a law across the European Union that would alleviate the pressure on workers to answer communications off the clock... 

Australians already enjoy a host of standardized benefits, including 20 days of paid annual leave, mandatory paid sick leave, &quot;long service&quot; leave of six weeks for those who have remained at an employer for at least seven years, 18 weeks of paid maternity leave and a nationwide minimum wage of about $15 an hour.

Whitaker said that FAA has had two challenges since January 5, when an emergency door panel blew off a Boeing 737 Max 9 jetliner over Oregon. &quot;One, what is wrong with this airplane?

                              <span>In 2022 Apple filed a lawsuit against startup Rivos. The lawsuit said that in one year Rivos had hired more than 40 former Apple employees to work on competing system-on-a-chip technology, according to Reuters, &quot;and that at least two former Apple engineers took gigabytes of confidential information with them to Rivos.&quot; 

But Friday Bloomberg reported that the two companies told a judge that they&#x27;d &quot;signed an agreement that potentially settles the case.&quot;

&quot;The agreement provides for remediation of Apple confidential information based on a forensic examination of Rivos systems and other activities,&quot; according to the filing in federal court in San Jose, California. &quot;The parties currently are working through that process.&quot; 

More details from Engadget:

Apple also accused the defendant of instructing the employees it hired away to steal presentations and other proprietary information for unreleased iPhone chip designs that cost billions of dollars to develop. Rivos countersued Apple last year, accusing the larger company of restricting employees&#x27; ability to work elsewhere and of hindering emerging startups&#x27; growth by using anticompetitive measures. 
The court dismissed Apple&#x27;s trade secret claims against Rivos in April 2023, though the company was allowed to file a revised complaint. Apple already settled with its six former employees who filed a countersuit against the iPhonemaker along with Rivos after they dropped their claims against each other last month. 

Both companies are now requesting the court to put their cases on hold until March 15, when they expect the settlement to be completed.

                              <span>An anonymous reader shared this report from Reuters:

Nvidia is building a new business unit focused on designing bespoke chips for cloud computing firms and others, including advanced AI processors, nine sources familiar with its plans told Reuters. The dominant global designer and supplier of AI chips aims to capture a portion of an exploding market for custom AI chips and shield itself from the growing number of companies pursuing alternatives to its products. 

The Santa Clara, California-based company controls about 80% of high-end AI chip market, a position that has sent its stock market value up 40% so far this year to $1.73 trillion after it more than tripled in 2023. Nvidia&#x27;s customers, which include ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms, have raced to snap up the dwindling supply of its chips to compete in the fast-emerging generative AI sector. Its H100 and A100 chips serve as a generalized, all-purpose AI processor for many of those major customers. But the tech companies have started to develop their own internal chips for specific needs. Doing so helps reduce energy consumption, and potentially can shrink the cost and time to design. 

Nvidia is now attempting to play a role in helping these companies develop custom AI chips that have flowed to rival firms such as Broadcom and Marvell Technology, said the sources, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly... 
Nvidia moving into this territory has the potential to eat into Broadcom and Marvell sales.

A California state lawmaker introduced a bill on Thursday aiming to force companies to test the most powerful artificial intelligence models before releasing them — a landmark proposal that could inspire regulation around the country as state legislatures increasingly tackle the swiftly evolving technology. 

 The new bill, sponsored by state Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat who represents San Francisco, would require companies training new AI models to test their tools for &quot;unsafe&quot; behavior, institute hacking protections and develop the tech in such a way that it can be shut down completely, according to a copy of the bill.

                              <span>Former FTX customers &quot;have reasons to believe they could actually recoup their money,&quot; reports CNBC:

Bankman-Fried, who could spend the rest of his life behind bars, was found guilty in November on seven criminal counts after roughly $10 billion in customer funds from his company went missing. Some of that money went to pay for Bankman-Fried&#x27;s lavish lifestyle, but much of it went towards other investments that have, of late, appreciated dramatically in value. Lawyers representing the bankruptcy estate of FTX told a judge in Delaware last week that they expect to fully repay customers and creditors with legitimate claims. Bankruptcy attorney Andrew Dietderich, who works with FTX&#x27;s new leadership team, said &quot;there is still a great amount of work and risk&quot; ahead in getting all the money bac…</span>

                              <span>Earth had its first year-long, 1.5-degree rise in temperature. But does this mean we&#x27;ve already missed our goal of limiting temperature increases to 1.5 degrees? 

No, argues the Washington Post:
There&#x27;s actually some disagreement about what exactly counts as breaching that threshold — but scientists and policymakers agree that it has to be a multiyear average, not a single 12-month period. Scientists estimate that without dramatic emissions reductions, that will happen sometime in the 2030s. But there could be other single years or 12-month periods that cross the line before then. 
Can we still avoid passing 1.5C? 

Most scientists say passing 1.5C is inevitable. &quot;The 1.5-degree limit is deader than a doornail,&quot; Columbia University climate scientist James Hansen said in a call with report…</span>

                              <span>Since 2006 Baldrson (Slashdot reader #78,598) has been part of the team verifying &quot;The Hutter Prize for Lossless Compression of Human Knowledge,&quot; an ongoing challenge to compress a 100-MB excerpt of Wikipedia (approximately the amount a human can read in a lifetime). 

&quot;The intention of this prize is to encourage development of intelligent compressors/programs as a path to Artificial General Intelligence,&quot; explains the project&#x27;s web site. 15 years ago, Baldrson wrote a Slashdot post explaining the logic (titled &quot;Compress Wikipedia and Win AI Prize&quot;):

The basic theory, for which Hutter provides a proof, is that after any set of observations the optimal move by an AI is find the smallest program that predicts those observations and then assume its environment is controlled by that program. Think of it as Ockham&#x27;s Razor on steroids. 


The amount of the prize also increases based on how much compression is achieved. (So if you compress the 1GB file x% better than the current record, you&#x27;ll receive x% of the prize...) The first prize was awarded in 2006. And now Baldrson writes:

Kaido Orav has just improved 1.38% on the Hutter Prize for Lossless Compression of Human Knowledge with his &quot;fx-cmix&quot; entry. The competition seems to be heating up, with this winner coming a mere 6 months since the prior winner. This is all the more impressive since each improvement in the benchmark approaches the (unknown) minimum size called the Kolmogorov Complexity of the data.

The Rust Foundation, which supports the development of the popular open-source Rust programming language... shared that Google LLC had made a $1 million contribution specifically earmarked for a C++/Rust interoperability effort known as the &quot;Interop Initiative.&quot; The initiative aims to foster seamless integration between Rust and the widely used C++ programming language, addressing one of the significant barriers to Rust&#x27;s adoption in legacy systems entrenched in C++ code. 

Rust has the ability to prevent common memory errors that plague C++ programs and offers a path toward more secure and reliable software systems. However, transitioning from C++ to Rust presents notable challenges, particularly for organizations with e…</span>

                              <span>Last week Microsoft&#x27;s Visual Studio Code editor suddenly stopped supporting Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. 

But now Microsoft &quot;has announced a temporary reprieve for developers who use VS Code to connect to servers, clouds, container, and other devices running on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS,&quot; according to the blog OMG Ubuntu:

Microsoft [had] pushed out an update to VS Code that bumps its glibc requirement, dropping support for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (which uses an older version of glibc) in the process. Innocuous though it sounds, that move had a huge impact, leaving thousands of developers who use VS Code unable to connect to/work with devices running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or other Linux distros using glibc 2.27, including RHEL 7, CentOS 7, and Amazon Linux 2. 

 — &quot;Screwed&quot; was the term many of those affected used! 

Well, good news: Microsoft says it plans to release a &#x27;recovery&#x27; update for VS Code soon. This will restore the ability for developers to use the text editor&#x27;s remote dev tools to connect to/work with machines running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and other, older Linux distros. 
But only for the next 12 months. 

&quot;We hope this will provide the needed time for you and your companies to migrate to newer Linux distributions,&quot; Microsoft&#x27;s senior product manager for VS Code posted on GitHub. He added that the software will &quot;show the appropriate dialog and banner that you are connecting to an OS that is not supported by VS Code.&quot; (The updated was released on Thursday.) 

He also thanked developers for their feedback and &quot;for sharing your passion for VS Code and sharing how it is being used to enable various scenarios.&quot;
